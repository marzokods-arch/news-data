Within the crisscrossing bands, red indicates higher water relative to the long-term average; blue indicates lower water. The tracks are layered atop the combined observations of other sea-level satellites. EUMETSAT Launched in November, Sentinel-6B will track ocean height with ultraprecision to advance marine forecasting, national security, and more. Sentinel-6B, a joint mission by NASA and its U.S. and European partners to survey 90% of the world’s oceans for the benefit of communities and commerce, has started sending back its first measurements since launching in November. A newly published map of the data shows sea levels across a vast stretch of the Eastern Seaboard and Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; About the size of a pickup truck, Sentinel-6B extends a decades-long effort led by the United States and Europe to track ocean height down to fractions of an inch using radar altimetry. Once its instruments and algorithms are fully calibrated next year, Sentinel-6B will return actionable d…",

However, this occurrence of El Niño ’s cooler counterpart is relatively weak, and its influence on weather and climate over the next several months remains to be seen. Part of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, La Niña develops when strengthened easterly trade winds intensify the upwelling of cold, deep water in the eastern tropical Pacific. This process cools large swaths of the eastern and central equatorial Pacific while simultaneously pushing warm surface waters westward toward Asia and Australia. In a report published on December 11, the NOAA Climate Prediction Center confirmed that below…",
