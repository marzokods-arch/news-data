    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google has announced “WeatherNext 2,” its most advanced weather forecasting model to date. The company claims the new AI-powered weather prediction model outperforms the previous version on 99.9% of variables, resulting in more accurate and timely reports. Google is integrating WeatherNext 2 in the Pixel Weather app, Google Search, Gemini, and Google Maps. Google is giving its weather tools a major upgrade. The company has announced WeatherNext 2, its most advanced AI-powered weather forecasting model yet. According to Google, WeatherNext 2 will make weather information in the Pixel Weather app , Google Search, Gemini, and Google Maps more accurate and more useful.",

Credit: NASA/Carla Thomas About the size of a full-size pickup truck, a newly launched satellite by NASA and its partners will provide ocean and atmospheric information to improve hurricane forecasts, help protect infrastructure, and benefit commercial activities, such as shipping. The Sentinel-6B satellite lifted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California at 9:21 p.m. PST on Nov. 16. Contact between the satellite and a ground station in northern Canada occurred about 1 hour and 30 minutes later at 10:54 p.m. All systems are functioning normally. “Understanding tidal patterns down to the inch is critical in protecting how we use our oceans every day on Earth,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Sentinel-6B will build upon the legacy of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich by making sea level measurements that improve forecasts used by communities, businesses, and operations…",
