    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority The Pixel Weather app is coming to Wear OS. Pixel Weather on Wear OS has a similar layout to the Weather app, but introduces Material 3 Expressive design. The app is expected to arrive with the Pixel Watch 4, but screenshots are already showing up on the Play Store. Back in 2022, Google gave Wear OS 3 a standalone weather app simply called Weather. It provides pretty much all the information you need from such an app, like the temperature, the daily highs and lows, precipitation chance, and so on. While it has long been a go-to weather app on Wear OS , it looks like itâ€™s about to be overshadowed by an expansion of the Pixel Weather app. The Pixel Weather app is expanding beyond phones and tablets to land on Wear OS. 9to5Google reports that Pixel Weather on Wear OS will have a similar layout to the Weather app, but it will bring Material 3 Expressive design changes.",
