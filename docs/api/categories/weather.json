Scientists called heliophysicists study these phenomena to help us better understand how and why it happens, and the effects it can have on the rest of our solar system. As the Sun enters a period of heightened activity, students now have a new way to explore its powerful effects on Earth and space. NASA’s Heliophysics Education Activation Team (NASA HEAT), in collaboration with My NASA Data, has released a new set of classroom resources that invite students and educators to engage with real NASA mission data to study space weather phenomena in real time. Hands-On Learning with Real NASA Data Developed as part of NASA HEAT’s mission to increase awareness and understanding of heliophysics, these new materials help learners connect directly with the science of the Sun and its influence on the solar system…",
