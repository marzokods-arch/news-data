    "body": "Fitbit may be one of the biggest names in wearables, but it’s far from your only option. I’ve tested just about every Fitbit device, along with comparable picks from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, and others. Many of the alternatives offer better value, features, or longevity. In fact, with Fitbit effectively shutting down its Versa and Sense lines, I no longer recommend most of its smartwatches at all (Pixel Watch excluded — we’ll get to that). These are the best Fitbit alternatives you can buy today that I’ve handpicked to match each Fitbit’s core features and price point as closely as possible.",

From smartwatches and fitness trackers to earbuds and non-wearables, there are a lot of options offering a range of features. Here are the best sleep trackers worth your time (and money). Fitbit Charge 6: The best sleep tracker overall I’ve tested dozens of sleep trackers, and Fitbit continues to offer some of the most reliable and actionable sleep data I’ve gotten my hands on. The Fitbit Charge 6 is my top pick for tapping into that ecosystem. The band-style tracker is compact, lightweight, and comfortable enough to wear all night, which is essential for bedtime tracking. Yet, despite its small form factor, it also packs in a well-rounded user experience for all-day wear. Alongside standout sleep features, the Charge 6 supports over 20 exercise modes, offers stress tracking via EDA scans, and integrates smoothly with Google’s growing suite of apps, all on a bright, colorful AMOLED display.",
