    "body": "Credit: Rogbid TL;DR Rogbid’s Fusion is a smart ring that looks like a shrunken smartwatch, screen and all. It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

The images show off the back of the phones, giving us a good look at the rear designs. Another leaker has also posted purported Galaxy S26 series cases, featuring magnet lines on the inside. We’ve already seen leaked renders showing off the Galaxy S26 phones , giving us a good idea of what to expect next month. Now, a trusted leaker has posted images showing these phones clad in cases. Veteran leaker Evan Blass has shared renders showing off the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra in UAG cases. He also posted a picture showing an S26 series device (ostensibly the S26 Ultra) with a screen protector. Check out the images below.",

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Tennis players at the Australian Open, including Alcaraz and Sabalenka, were instructed by umpires to remove under-wrist WHOOP trackers during matches, despite previous tournament allowances. The ITF has approved various models of the WHOOP tracker for match use so long as haptic feedback is disabled, but Grand Slam events can impose additional rules independently. WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies. Of late, WHOOP has landed in some unforeseen controversy during a tennis tournament, and the company has wittingly responded by sending players… underwear?
