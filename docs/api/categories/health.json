The update is arriving for the Pixel 6 and newer devices, including the Pixel Tablet. As usual, the security update is rolling out alongside the latest Pixel Drop. Google is now rolling out the September security update to Pixel phones. Over the next few weeks, all supported Pixel devices, i.e., Pixel 6 and above, running Android 16 , will get the latest patches. The September update is not to be confused with the latest Pixel Drop , which brings a number of new features to older Pixel phones and other Pixel devices.",
