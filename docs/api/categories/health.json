    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is sending out a notice that it will terminate some of the Health app’s Fitness Program services. Programs offered through downloads in the Fitness Program and programs uploaded before December 31, 2022, will be discontinued. These services will no longer be available after the new version of the Samsung Health app is released. Samsung has some updates in store for its Health app. Earlier this week, we reported on changes, like enhanced weekly reports , that will come with One UI 8.5. We also discovered through an APK teardown that the app will gain new tools to protect your hearing . Although Samsung Health is set to add several new features, it looks like it will also be losing a few. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung Health is working on some new tools for your hearing health. A Noise card on the app’s home screen will let you quickly evaluate your daily exposure. Advanced Measurement will let users set specific volume level targets for warning notifications. Lots of us use our smartphones and wearables to track our health , but what exactly does that encompass? The very concept of “health” is a lot more multi-faceted and nuanced than just “not sick” or “feeling good,” and we’ve developed dozens of metrics we can track in pursuit of all its forms, from calories burned during a workout, to time spent snoring at night. And while the problem with snoring is more about what it means for the person doing it than the person who might have to listen to it, today we’re very much thinking about loud sounds like that as we check out what Samsung Health is working on next.
