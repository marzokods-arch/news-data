    "body": "Credit: X/@ZONEofTECH TL;DR A Galaxy Ring user says the battery swelled while the device was on their finger, leaving it stuck and painful. The user was denied boarding a flight and had the ring removed in the hospital using ice and medical lubricant. Photos of the ring after it was removed show a visibly distorted battery. Update 3, October 1, 2025 (02:02 PM ET): We’ve officially heard back from Samsung about this incident, and the company tells us that it is currently investigating the matter. It’s probably far too early to speculate where that investigation will lead, but we look forward to updating you with any outcome the company ultimately shares. Update 2, October 1, 2025 (04:28 AM ET): The affected user, Daniel, shared another update , showing off their finger after the ring removal. There are some small marks, which the user is confident will heal in some time.",
