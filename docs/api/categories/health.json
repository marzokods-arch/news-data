    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority I’ve lost almost 9 pounds (4 kg) so far, my upper abs are starting to show, and I just generally feel a lot better, all thanks to Gemini. The chatbot has helped me come up with a detailed training as well as a diet plan and has guided me through all the issues I’ve run into during my fitness journey that kicked off back in September. I wrote about my experience using Gemini as a personal fitness coach in November, and it was mostly positive up until that point. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. The chatbot went from a proper fitness coach I relied on daily to nothing more than a distraction that caused more harm than good.",
