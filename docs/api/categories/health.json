But when something goes wrong, that convenience can quickly turn into a liability. A Galaxy Ring user recently reported that his ring’s battery swelled while on his finger, making removal impossible without hospital intervention. More than just nightmare fuel, the incident highlights a design flaw across the entire industry. Smart rings, for all their promise, lack an emergency exit. Trapped by my own tech Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority Unlike watches or bands, rings don’t unbuckle (or un-Velcro) for easy removal. They only come off the way they go on: sliding past knuckles. If a finger swells, whether from heat, hydration, or a malfunctioning battery, the device can quickly become a vise. In the case of one unlucky Galaxy Ring user , battery swelling turned a well-fitting device into a finger trap, grounding his flight plans and sending him to the ER. The fear of having a ring of any kind stuck on my finger is very real. That’s exactly what happened to tech creator Daniel (@ZONEofTECH).

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Strava is suing Garmin for allegedly infringing on several patents. These patents are primarily related to segments and heatmaps. Strava wants Garmin to cease offering products that utilize these patents. Even the strongest partnerships face challenges occasionally, and that’s certainly the case with two fitness industry giants. Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements. Strava also wants Garmin to stop selling products that may utilize these patents, which would include a slew of its fitness watches, cycling computers, and the Garmin Connect app. The lawsuit, first reported by fitness industry veteran DC Rainmaker , focuses on two primary features utilized by both companies: segments and heatmaps. Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route. Breaking down longer routes encourages users to hit more manageable targets across a more extended training session or race. Heatmaps, meanwhile, display areas and routes that users traffic heavily, effectively highlighting popular training areas. This is an excellent…",
