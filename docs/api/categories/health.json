With a Black Friday deal slashing the price by a full 40%, it’s an even more tempting prospect. The $80 price drop reduces it from its $200 retail price to just $119.95 , down from $199.95, and hasn’t been cheaper all year. The Fitbit Versa 4 boasts several attractive features. It has built-in GPS, continuous heart-rate monitoring, and over 40 exercise modes to choose from. It also provides SpO₂ tracking and a Daily Readiness Score, which can be great motivators for any fitness journey.",
