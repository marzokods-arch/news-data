    "body": "It is 4 am. About eight hours ago I told my partner I wasn't really vibing with News Tower , a handsome newspaper management sim that's leaving early access after nearly two years. I've not left my desk since. See, that was before the Newspaper Wars. Before I decided to stick it to the corrupt politicians, puritanical 1930s Karens and the intimidating mobsters. Before I hired lawyers, installed pneumatic tubes and finally added a third page to New York's beacon of truth, its greatest paper, The Firestarter. (Image credit: Sparrow Night) Now I'm a machine, spitting out hard-hitting story after hard-hitting story. Mine disasters, political scandals, bank heists, economic turmoil—and yes, the occasional bit of celebrity news, but always on a quest to inform rather than sensationalise. And at the end of the week, I watch the numbers go up. Readership, influence, my bank balance. Sure, I have to occasionally deal with protesters jamming up the front door, or mobsters breaking in to trash all my equipment, but I'm unstoppable. After smashing my head against the competing interests of the city's factions for hours, I finally found my groove, reaching a zen-like state when I am the report…",

    "summary": "This is what Leon was sacrificed for.",
    "body": "Resident Evil Requiem is one of the scariest Resident Evil games I've played, and I only got to see a 30-minute demo at Gamescom, so I dread to think about what the rest of the game will be like. That's due to a very deliberate choice by the developers to try and steer this next RE game towards horror, rather than action. \"I understand how Resident Evil 4 and Village became more action-heavy,\" producer Masato Kumazawa says in an interview with Press Start . \"Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.\" (Image credit: Capcom) Playing as Grace Ashcroft, a technical analyst for the FBI, those of us brave enough to wade into Requiem won't get the comfort of an unshakable protagonist. While she does know how to handle a gun, Grace isn't a fighter and therefore must run away from all the monsters that you'll find lurking around. This was actually the predominant reason as to why Leon Kennedy doesn't return as our protagonist —he's just too cool. \"With Requiem, we decided to make sure it was scary until the end,\" Kumazawa co…",
