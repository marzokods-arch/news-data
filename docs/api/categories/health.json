    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung is updating its Gaming Hub app, allowing users to discover games based on other titles they play. Gaming Hub will also bring new features to track achievements and compare them against those of other players. The update also brings YouTube videos featuring gameplays, guides, and other content from gaming creators. While gaming on Android is diverse and fragmented, Google Play Games has attempted to unify gamers with its community features and the ability to synchronize your achievements to the cloud, so they’re available across devices. Now Samsung wants to step up with similar features to help Galaxy phone or tablet owners track and compare their small triumphs. It is rolling out a slightly redesigned Gaming Hub app focused on discovery, video content, and social features. Samsung says its Gaming Hub app has more than 160 million monthly users, which is why it has updated the app, making it easier for mobile gamers to find and download games. It says the new discovery recommendations include “organic” and “personalized” suggestions based on the titles users already play most on their Galaxy phone and tablet. The suggestions are expected to change bas…",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority I’ve lost almost 9 pounds (4 kg) so far, my upper abs are starting to show, and I just generally feel a lot better, all thanks to Gemini. The chatbot has helped me come up with a detailed training as well as a diet plan and has guided me through all the issues I’ve run into during my fitness journey that kicked off back in September. I wrote about my experience using Gemini as a personal fitness coach in November, and it was mostly positive up until that point. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. The chatbot went from a proper fitness coach I relied on daily to nothing more than a distraction that caused more harm than good.",
