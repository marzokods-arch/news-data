    "body": "With the launch of its new charging case, Oura finally closed one of the only practical gaps between the brand and its rivals. I’ve been testing the new setup for more than a week, and the upgrade is noticeable. More importantly, it removes one of the few remaining advantages I could point to elsewhere. Closing the gap",

    "body": "Credit: Rogbid TL;DR Rogbid’s Fusion is a smart ring that looks like a shrunken smartwatch, screen and all. It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",
