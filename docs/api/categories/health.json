    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus has claimed that the OnePlus 15’s battery will maintain 80% of its capacity after four years. The company told Android Authority that the phone maintains “excellent health” after 1,400 charging cycles. This comes after the OnePlus 13 offered 1,000 charging cycles before effectively losing 20% of its capacity. The OnePlus 15 has just been launched in global markets, and it has a gigantic battery for a flagship Android phone . The company also claims that this battery will maintain 80% of its effective capacity after four years, but what does this actually mean? OnePlus’s aforementioned battery health claim is a departure from the rest of the industry, which typically measures battery degradation in charging cycles . So how many charging cycles can the OnePlus 15 endure before it reaches 80% of its effective capacity?",
