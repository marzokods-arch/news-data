    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority I’ve been wearing and reviewing Oura Rings long enough to know the experience well. They’re comfortable, reliable, and tied to a well-rounded platform, which is why they’ve stayed in my rotation for years. Then, Oura rolled out two updates I didn’t see coming: colorful, ceramic Oura Ring 4 variants and multi-device support. While neither was something I’d been actively pining for, the combo has reshaped how the ring fits into my daily life.",
