    "body": "If I’m being honest, I’m terrible at tracking my nutrition. The minute you ask me to install another app and start logging everything I eat is the moment you tend to lose me. It’s not because I don’t care (I’m very conscious of what I eat), but rather because I don’t want to take the time when I already have apps for my steps, sleep, stress, and whatever else. But when Garmin announced it would bring nutrition tracking into its Connect Plus experience, I decided I had to give it a try.",
