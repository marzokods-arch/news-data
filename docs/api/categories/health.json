    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Garmin has joined the Wrapped trend by releasing its own 2025 recap called “Connect Rundown.” Unlike most other services that offer year-end summaries, Garmin’s is behind the Connect Plus paywall. Many users were already disgruntled with the Connect Plus subscription after spending big money on a Garmin device. ‘Tis the season when every platform rolls out a Wrapped-style recap of the year, and Garmin has joined the crowd with its new Connect Rundown. Before you rush to review your metrics, you should know that you won’t see it unless you’re paying for Connect Plus. TechRadar reported on the feature’s release, with the Rundown bundling your yearly stats, such as steps, sleep scores, workout totals, Fitness Age, and more, into a shareable summary. Other services, like YouTube and Spotify, offer that kind of recap for free, and Duolingo even incentivizes you to share it . Garmin has opted to make it a premium perk.",

NASA Hazardous Materials Summary Tables (HMSTs) are a compilation of the chemical, biological, and flammability hazards of materials on a given flight or mission. HMSTs are required by Safety for all Programs, including but not limited to ISS, Commercial Crew Program (CCP), Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), and Gateway. Johnson Space Center (JSC) toxicologists evaluate the toxic hazard level of all liquids, gases, particles, or gels flown on or to any manned U.S. spacecraft. The biosafety hazard level and flammability levels are assigned by JSC microbiologists and materials experts and are documented in an HMST and in a computerized in-flight version of the HMST called the HazMat (Hazardous Materials) database.
