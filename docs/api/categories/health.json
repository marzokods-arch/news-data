    "body": "TL;DR Google is sending notifications prompting users to set up Health Connect, its service for syncing health and fitness data between different apps. These new alerts aim to solve the service’s poor discoverability, as many users are unaware that Health Connect exists on their phones. The prompts come as Google prepares to expand the platform with new features, such as native step tracking in an upcoming Android update. There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022. Although the number of compatible apps and its feature set have grown steadily since its debut, many people still don’t know it exists. That’s why Google is sending alerts prompting users to connect their apps to Health Connect. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The app is available in the Play Store for $5, or you can build it yourself for free from its source code. People are already criticizing the app for being a vibe-coded ripoff, and suggest gamers wait for other PCSX2 Android ports. 2025 has already been a huge year for emulation on Android, and it feels like we’re never going for more than a few days without a new update. That’s included plenty of advancements for PlayStation 2 emulation, like the recent progress we’ve seen with NetherSX2 . Today we’re checking out a new addition to the fray, with the publication of PSX2 — but there are a few big asterisks hanging next to that release that you’ll definitely want to be aware of.
