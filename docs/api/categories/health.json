    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Garmin has joined the Wrapped trend by releasing its own 2025 recap called “Connect Rundown.” Unlike most other services that offer year-end summaries, Garmin’s is behind the Connect Plus paywall. Many users were already disgruntled with the Connect Plus subscription after spending big money on a Garmin device. ‘Tis the season when every platform rolls out a Wrapped-style recap of the year, and Garmin has joined the crowd with its new Connect Rundown. Before you rush to review your metrics, you should know that you won’t see it unless you’re paying for Connect Plus. TechRadar reported on the feature’s release, with the Rundown bundling your yearly stats, such as steps, sleep scores, workout totals, Fitness Age, and more, into a shareable summary. Other services, like YouTube and Spotify, offer that kind of recap for free, and Duolingo even incentivizes you to share it . Garmin has opted to make it a premium perk.",
