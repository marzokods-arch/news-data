    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung is adding the option to schedule and attend virtual clinic appointments through the Samsung Health app. The feature is live in all 50 states of the US, alongside D.C. Samsung Health already lets users manage prescriptions and store health records in the app. Samsung already offers a broad spectrum of health metrics for users of its Galaxy Watch or Ring. These metrics, including complex ones such as AGEs and antioxidant indexes, or much more common ones such as ECG and hypertension alerts, already paint a comprehensive picture of a user’s health. While this data is generated from wearables’ stats and calculated using algorithms, Samsung is paving the way for more personalized care right from your device. The Korean giant is taking a significant step towards telehealth with a new feature on Galaxy smartphones and tablets. It recently announced a partnership with HealthTap, a US-based virtual healthcare provider, allowing users to seek opinions from medical professionals without physically visiting a clinic or hospital.",
