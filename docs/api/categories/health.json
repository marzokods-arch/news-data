    "summary": "Google is preparing major upgrades to Health Connect for a future Android release. Here’s what to expect.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is redesigning Health Connect’s settings to place connected apps front and center while streamlining the overall menu layout. A new grouped view for “App access” will allow you to grant or deny permissions for entire data categories with a single tap. We also found evidence that Health Connect will soon support tracking for alcohol consumption and various medical symptoms. Android has dozens of fitness tracking tools , giving you a wealth of options for improving your health. Managing the data collected by these apps can be tough, however, which is why Google created Health Connect . This service aggregates all your health and fitness data in one central, secure place. It also simplifies sharing between apps, meaning developers don’t have to build their own data transfer tools. When Google launched Health Connect in 2022, it supported just over 40 data types across six categories. With the release of Android 16 , Google expanded the service to include yoga and meditation sessions (“Wellness”) as well as medical records like allergies, vaccinations, and lab results. Most recently, the Android 16 QPR2 update brought native step tracking support to Health Connect.",
