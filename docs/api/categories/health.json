    "body": "Credit: Rogbid TL;DR Rogbid’s Fusion is a smart ring that looks like a shrunken smartwatch, screen and all. It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",

We’ve already seen leaked renders showing off the Galaxy S26 phones , giving us a good idea of what to expect next month. Now, a trusted leaker has posted images showing these phones clad in cases. Veteran leaker Evan Blass has shared renders showing off the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra in UAG cases. He also posted a picture showing an S26 series device (ostensibly the S26 Ultra) with a screen protector. Check out the images below.",
