    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung is adding the option to schedule and attend virtual clinic appointments through the Samsung Health app. The feature is live in all 50 states of the US, alongside D.C. Samsung Health already lets users manage prescriptions and store health records in the app. Samsung already offers a broad spectrum of health metrics for users of its Galaxy Watch or Ring. These metrics, including complex ones such as AGEs and antioxidant indexes, or much more common ones such as ECG and hypertension alerts, already paint a comprehensive picture of a user’s health. While this data is generated from wearables’ stats and calculated using algorithms, Samsung is paving the way for more personalized care right from your device. The Korean giant is taking a significant step towards telehealth with a new feature on Galaxy smartphones and tablets.

The preview is available for Fitbit Premium users with a Pixel Watch or Fitbit device (Android first). The tool offers AI-driven guidance on fitness, sleep, and health through a chat interface. Google is officially putting health-focused AI to work on users’ wrists. Beginning October 28, the company will open a public preview of its Gemini-powered Fitbit Personal Health Coach for Fitbit Premium users in the US.
