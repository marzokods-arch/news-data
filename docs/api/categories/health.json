    "body": "Credit: Rogbid TL;DR Rogbid’s Fusion is a smart ring that looks like a shrunken smartwatch, screen and all. It goes further than many novelty ring watches by adding health and fitness tracking. At $49.99, it’s cheap enough to be a weird gift, and even has a “couple interaction mode.” Smart rings have been edging closer to smartwatches for a while now, but Rogbid has taken a more literal approach. The company has just launched the Rogbid Fusion, a device that looks like a smartwatch shrunk down into ring form, complete with a screen, health tracking, and even the option to wear it on your wrist instead. Rogbid isn’t a big name in wearables, but it’s been selling budget smart devices for years. As spotted by The Verge , the Fusion is now available from Rogbid’s online store for $49.99. That’s far cheaper than most ring watches, and it comes in gold, silver, and black finishes.",
