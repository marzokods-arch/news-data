    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is sending out a notice that it will terminate some of the Health app’s Fitness Program services. Programs offered through downloads in the Fitness Program and programs uploaded before December 31, 2022, will be discontinued. These services will no longer be available after the new version of the Samsung Health app is released. Samsung has some updates in store for its Health app. Earlier this week, we reported on changes, like enhanced weekly reports , that will come with One UI 8.5. We also discovered through an APK teardown that the app will gain new tools to protect your hearing . Although Samsung Health is set to add several new features, it looks like it will also be losing a few. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
