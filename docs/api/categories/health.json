    "body": "Fitbit may be one of the biggest names in wearables, but it’s far from your only option. I’ve tested just about every Fitbit device, along with comparable picks from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, and others. Many of the alternatives offer better value, features, or longevity. In fact, with Fitbit effectively shutting down its Versa and Sense lines, I no longer recommend most of its smartwatches at all (Pixel Watch excluded — we’ll get to that). These are the best Fitbit alternatives you can buy today that I’ve handpicked to match each Fitbit’s core features and price point as closely as possible.",
