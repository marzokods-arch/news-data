    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung is updating its Gaming Hub app, allowing users to discover games based on other titles they play. Gaming Hub will also bring new features to track achievements and compare them against those of other players. The update also brings YouTube videos featuring gameplays, guides, and other content from gaming creators. While gaming on Android is diverse and fragmented, Google Play Games has attempted to unify gamers with its community features and the ability to synchronize your achievements to the cloud, so they’re available across devices. Now Samsung wants to step up with similar features to help Galaxy phone or tablet owners track and compare their small triumphs. It is rolling out a slightly redesigned Gaming Hub app focused on discovery, video content, and social features.

I wrote about my experience using Gemini as a personal fitness coach in November, and it was mostly positive up until that point. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. The chatbot went from a proper fitness coach I relied on daily to nothing more than a distraction that caused more harm than good.",
