    "body": "Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate was released on July 15, 2025, and ever since then developer Bungie has been fire-fighting one of the expansion's many unpopular additions: unstable cores. Forgive the Destiny jargon, because this thing loves an in-game currency, but unstable cores are how you infuse gear, increasing its power level beyond the seasonal cap.
