    "body": "World of Warcraft's next expansion will introduce player housing and it's coming with WoW's first ever premium currency. Wowhead recently dug up something called \"Hearthsteel\" in the files of the Midnight alpha and now Blizzard has made a blog post confirming that it's real and on its way with the expansion. It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values. In addition to providing \"appropriate financial protections for both parties\"—whatever that means—Blizzard says it's to help players purchase multiple items at once. \"As an example, you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table, multiple …",

Unfortunately, I knew about it ahead of time because of the internet, but if you haven't played it yet—it's an old game, but young people exist and not everyone has time for everything—then this is me warning you to play it before somebody spoils it for you. (If you just want to know what it is, you can spoil it for yourself by reading the fourth slide in this article about PC gaming's greatest twists .) Jennifer Hale, the voice actor playing Jedi Master Bastila Shan in Knights of the Old Republic, did not know the twist in advance. As is often the case in videogame recording, she didn't get to see the script until she was in the booth. \"We never got our scripts ahead of time\", Hale recently told Buzzfeed . \"Most of the games I've ever done have been cold reading. I walk in, and I see the line. I do the line, and it goes to market.\" And so she got to be as shocked as most players were when she got to the end. \"I did not see the twist coming!\" she said. \"Knights of the Old Republic really sh…",
