We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . You ever watch those art restoration YouTube channels? The guys who have some bristling kit of arcane brushes, tweezers, spudgers and sponges, and who put them to use painstakingly removing a fine layer of yellow —origin indeterminate—from the surface of masterpiece after masterpiece? It's a process of subtraction: some schmutz removed here, some cruft excised there. By the end of the job—which could take days, months, years—what you're left with is… the original piece, its glory unobscured by the detritus of centuries. If you sent it through a wormhole back to the day its creator first finished painting it, odds are they wouldn't notice anything had changed. (Image credit: Nightdive Studios, Looking Glass Studios, Irrational Games) You see where I'm going with this. System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition was not some sweeping overhaul, despite how long Nightdive had it in the oven. It did not add ray …",

    "body": "Please note: major spoilers for Fallout Season 2 Episode 2! I praised the continuing use of flashbacks in my Fallout Season 2 review , and this episode opens with a perfect example. We've seen Shady Sands at its peak in Lucy's memory, as she realized her childhood recollection of an idealized cornfield actually took place during the brief time she spent there with her mother, but now we get to see it through the eyes of young Maximus. He's the same age as he was in last season's flashback to the immediate aftermath of the bombing, so we know something's likely to go wrong even as we tour idyllic suburbs patrolled by NCR troopers—one in veteran ranger armor complete with duster and gas mask. Max's father hands his mother a jar of pure rad-free water (siphoned from Vault 33, which is how they came to Rose MacLean's attention in the first place), and Jo Stafford sings You Belong to Me. Everything's perfect. A little too perfect. Here it comes now: a caravan is led into town by a man repeating a phrase New Vegas players will know well. \"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.\" He collapses, bleeding from the eyes, as Maximus and his father join the crowd gath…",
