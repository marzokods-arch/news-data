Peak is somewhere near the opposite end of the spectrum. It's a small, focused idea, and originated as a four-week game jam project the team was hoping to push out and immediately move on from . They decided to stick around and support it a bit more when the game started selling like hotcakes, but co-creator Nick Kaman told Game File there's still a lot of value in a short, sweet development cycle. \"Peak for me has kind of proved that there are definitely different, but maybe better ways to make games,\" Kaman told Game File. \"My prescription is: don’t spend three years.

But when's that ever stopped anyone? In the Divinity AMA with the studio, Redditor 'ilikebreadabunch' found the only opening and took it, asking Larian if there's a small spoiler that it could give that won't make any sense until we've actually played the game. Larian obliged, and writing director Adam Smith simply replied , \"Alligator\". Well…uh, that certainly fits the bill. Even if it's a main story spoiler, perhaps a character's final words (that would be an odd choice, I'll admit), good luck getting anything of use from it. With no confirmed release date or even window right now, we'll be waiting a long time before we find out what this clue's all about.
