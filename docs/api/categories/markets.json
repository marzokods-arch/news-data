    "body": "UPDATE (Jan. 23): The Eagles got a double dose of good news on Jan. 22, when the Recording Industry Association of America re-certified their 1976 compilation Eagles/Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 , at the 40 million level and their subsequent studio album Hotel California at the 28 million level. The greatest-hits album was already No. 1 on our list of albums that have been certified Double Diamond or better by the RIAA. The latest upgrade allowed Hotel California to move up from No. 4 to No. 3 on the list. Related Eagles&#8217; &#8216;Greatest Hits&#8217; Is First Album to Be Certified Quadruple Diamond by&nbsp;RIAA PREVIOUSLY (Dec. 5. 2025): Metallica celebrated a major career milestone in May, when their 1991 album Metallica was certified Double Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was just the 14th album to reach that plateau , which signifies shipments of 20 million albums (or streaming equivalent units) in the U.S. Double Diamond albums were unthinkable when the RIAA launched its gold awards program in 1958. Only one album was certified gold that year (signifying $1 million in manufacturer’s dollar volume; the criteria later changed) – the soun…",

Credit: NASA A new NASA study of its Apollo lunar soils clarifies the Moon’s record of meteorite impacts and timing of water delivery. These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith . They learned that even under generous assumptions, meteorite delivery since about four billion years ago could only have supplied a small fraction of Earth’s water. The Moon serves as an ancient archive of the impact history …",
