    "body": "On June 16, 2025, I pre-ordered an Android smartphone . I’ve done this dozens of times before in my life, but this time was a little different. On that day, I was pre-ordering a phone that I didn’t want and had every reason to believe I would never actually see. The device in question was the T1 Phone, the first phone from a brand new company called Trump Mobile. Trump Mobile is both a new carrier and phone company started by President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump. The T1 Phone was, at the time, sold as a made-in-America, gold-plated Android phone that looked alarmingly close to an iPhone. On the back was an enormous “T1” logo above an American flag.",

Frattare Westerlund 1, the biggest and closest “super” star cluster to Earth, dazzles in this image released on July 23, 2025. This view combines x-ray data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory (in pink, blue, purple, and orange), infrared data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (in yellow, gold, and blue), and optical data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (in cyan, grey, and light yellow). Data from Chandra and other telescopes is helping astronomers delve deeper into this galactic factory where stars are vigorously being produced. Observations from Chandra have uncovered thousands of individual stars pumping out X-ray emission into the cluster. This image is part of a compilation of images featuring data from Chandra along with a host of other telescopes.
