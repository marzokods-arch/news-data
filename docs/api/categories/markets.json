I can't claim all the credit; the Asus ProArt PA401 is a gem. The wood finish down the front panels, the all-black interior, and the clever switches that make it a breeze are all to thank for that. Now I do realise the irony of saying less is more and placing two sticks of G.Skill's finest gold-plated, faux-crystal RAM sticks in there, but they don't look anything near as garish as they sound. This is an all-AMD gaming PC; my slight obsession with using the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in full force here. It's a powerful gaming chip for a reasonable price—3D V-Cache working a treat for improving frame rates. If you wanted to improve further, you could opt for the 16 cores of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D , but you'll pay a tall fee for that. No, the 9800X3D works great here, and most of all in combination with the Asus Prime 9070 XT I've selected to go with it. Get the build: $2,168 | £2,018 Chassis Asus ProArt Case PA401 Woo…",
