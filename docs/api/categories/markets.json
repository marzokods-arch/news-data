AMD is smart enough to understand this, to understand the way the cosy old days tug at the heart strings of PC gamers, especially in a difficult time where the past we yearn for is fully rose-tinted. So we shouldn't be surprised to see the red team taking us back a decade with its thoroughly nostalgic new CPU, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. It's taking us back to a different time when one processor company was so dominant it could stand to release barely iterative versions of its top processors because it had precisely zero true competition. Welcome to AMD's very own Skylake era, an era where Intel's gaming processors are so far off the pace AMD can replace the best gaming CPU over a year down the line with a new chip and not actually make any changes beyond a clock speed tweak. Yes, we've waited 15 months for an upgrade to the old Ryzen 7 9800X3D and all we get is a 400 MHz overclock.

But if you're here, I imagine a tense, perilous excursion into a derelict gigamall filled with ravenous undead and players who'll happily bludgeon you to death to steal whatever junk you've gathered is, ultimately, exactly what you're looking for. Well, look no longer: Here's when The Midnight Walkers unlocks in early access. When does The Midnight Walkers launch? The Midnight Walkers launches in early access at 6 pm PST on January 28 , as announced in a Steam news post by Oneway Ticket Studio. While that leaves the west coast of the US with some comfortable evening hours for zombie chopping, it means launch day players in Europe will be doing their Midnight Walking well after midnight.
