    "body": "Jacob Fox, hardware writer (Image credit: Future) This week: I've been trying out different lightweight mice, trying to decide whether I can tell the difference between 41 g and 36 g under my fingertips. The memory price crisis has come at my least favourite time: a time when it inconveniences me . You can have your early 2025 GPU shortage, that's fine. That didn't affect me, but this does, therefore it's bad. That's a valid argument, trust me, I did logic 101. You see, I considered upgrading my entire build a few months ago, but I put it off because the start of a new GPU generation isn't my favourite time to upgrade. So I came up with my cunning plan: I would wait until next year when hopefully RTX 50-series Super cards launch, and then I'd pounce. And I'd have the benefit of cheaper prices across the board by then, too. I can hear you snickering from here. 'Cheaper prices', I know. I've been foiled by the tumultuous tides of today's AI-first tech industry and resultant memory shortage. My current build, if you're wondering, consists of an RTX 3060 Ti, Core i5 12600KF, and 32 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM. And that's 3200 MT/s RAM that really cannot hit those speeds, at least not paired w…",

Wowhead recently dug up something called \"Hearthsteel\" in the files of the Midnight alpha and now Blizzard has made a blog post confirming that it's real and on its way with the expansion. It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values. In addition to providing \"appropriate financial protections for both parties\"—whatever that means—Blizzard says it's to help players purchase multiple items at once. \"As an example, you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table, multiple …",
