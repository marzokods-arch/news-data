Joining her are Alix Wilton Regan (Alt Cunningham from Cyberpunk 2077 ), Doug Cockle (Geralt in The Witcher games ), Ciara Berkely (the new voice of Ciri in The Witcher 4 ), Ben Starr (Verso in Clair Obscur , that one meme where he is impassive and bright), and Shai Matheson (the upcoming Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight). Which game will end up taking home the Ultimate Game of the Year award? Well, that depends on the whims of democracy— voting is live now , if you want to make your voice heard—but it'll be one of 12 games on the official shortlist. Those games are: Blue Prince Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Donkey Kong Bananza Ghost of Yōtei…",

According to the players trying it out on the Midnight alpha, it's designed with almost no caveats to what you can create. There are years and years of decorations from various parts of the game that Blizzard is making available to stick in your house, which is why it's always seemed like a no-brainer for Blizzard to add. But there will also be new decorations, some of which are going to cost you real money, and now we have evidence of how that's going to work. Wowhead recently dug up a new premium currency in the Midnight alpha build called Hearthsteel. Datamined images depict Hearthsteel as silver coins with the swirly housing logo, which is based on Hearthstone's item art. Judging from the images that show different amounts of the coins, it seems pretty obvious that they're going to be a premium currency related to housing. While I doubt anyone will be surprised to see Blizzard preparing to charge for housing stuff this quickly, it's actually a first for WoW to have a distinct premium currency.
