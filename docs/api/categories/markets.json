Larian is returning to its home-grown fantasy series with a new entry simply titled Divinity. We do not yet have gameplay or a release window, but Geoff Keighley described it as Larian's \"biggest game ever,\" and \"even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.\" After some surprise live antics, including performers being hoisted over the crowd in a high wire act, we got a pre-rendered trailer showing a much darker sort of game than we're used to from Larian. A tortured man is shown being burned alive in a Wicker Man-style enclosure, with celebrating peasants degenerating into an orgiastic bacchanal outside, overseen by flagellants and a masked cultist under some kind of celestial conjunction. This predictably unleashes some kind of unholy force that attacks the revelers, and after a fade to black, we can see that they've been incorporated into a gruesome amalgamation of bodies in the shape of that mysterious desert statue everyone was buzzing about. Well, now we know it was neither a portent of the end times, nor a marketing stunt for The Elder Scrol…",
