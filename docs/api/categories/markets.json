The Danish toy giant calls the new Smart Brick its \"biggest innovation since the first Lego minifigure in 1978… Lego bricks that play back.\" At its heart we're talking about a standard 2 x 4 brick that features a ton of technology inside—from accelerometers, to light and sound sensors, to a mini speaker—that allows it to respond to other Lego pieces in real time and in space. There are already similar kinds of things built into toys that respond to cameras in your smart devices to 'enhance' play, but I love the fact Lego has deliberately eschewed that avenue because of the attention a screened device will inevitably pull away from the physical play. As a human who lives full-time with two very small humans, I'm all too aware that when a screen pops out of your pocket—even if it's to interact with the physical world—that it will immediately become the object of attention to the exclusion of all else. It's very Lego to consciousl…",
