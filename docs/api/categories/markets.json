I'm digging what I see, including an oppressive northern European dreariness, some great sci-fi/alt history scene setting, and stellar art direction, which pairs Mathorne's style with early aughts, PS2 vibes, but \"how you remember it.\" I'm reminded of Nightdive's approach to the System Shock Remake, which boasted high-fidelity assets paired with deliberately noisy, pixelated textures.
