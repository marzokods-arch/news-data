    "body": "Grinding for badges is one of the best ways to get free diamonds in 99 Nights in the Forest , and most come with straightforward, in-game descriptions explaining exactly what you need to do.

The opinion's introduction, which begins with a quote from Goethe's Faust—\"Gold all doth lure, Gold doth secure all things. Alas, we poor!\"—explains that \"a taxable person\" avoided paying VAT [value added tax] on \"not insignificant\" transactions in which RuneScape gold was purchased from players and sold to others at a profit (via GamesRadar ).
