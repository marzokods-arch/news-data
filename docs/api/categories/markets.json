We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . One of my bigger disappointments this year in gaming was reviewing Marvel Cosmic Invasion .

The guys who have some bristling kit of arcane brushes, tweezers, spudgers and sponges, and who put them to use painstakingly removing a fine layer of yellow —origin indeterminate—from the surface of masterpiece after masterpiece?
