    "body": "TL;DR Interested in picking up an Analogue 3D? Stock is set to return on Monday. Orders placed next week will begin shipping in early December. Analogue has raised the console’s pricing from $250 to $270. One of the coolest things about being a retro gamer is that you’ve got just so many different options for how to enjoy your favorite games. Let’s say you want to play some Nintendo 64: You can sign up for Nintendo Switch Online and play your games there. If you’d rather go a little more DIY with emulation, you can always install an N64 emulator on your phone. Or if you’re me, you’re wiring up an actual N64 console to your Sony PVM. If you’d rather use a modern screen, though, you might want to check out the Analogue 3D — and we’ve got some good news today for anyone interested in that (plus a little bad). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
