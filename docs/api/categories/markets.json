    "body": "I recently rediscovered a Google Maps feature that I completely forgot existed, but you can’t really blame me. If you frequent travel subreddits and forums, you’ll likely be familiar with My Maps , Google’s custom map creation platform. However, if you’ve only ever experienced Google Maps on an Android phone, I’d be surprised if you’ve heard of it, unless you’ve accidentally scrolled to the bottom of the You tab. My Maps is an obscure but powerful tool for creating personalized maps. Users can command various mapping features, including pinning custom markers on places, adding notes and images, routing info to and from multiple points, KML and GPX info, and layering all this data onto existing map visualizations. In short, My Maps allows users to bend Google’s mapping products to their will in impressive ways. Sounds great, right? Well, after spending a few days browsing the various and adventurous custom maps users have created and a few more tests of the limits of the tool myself, I realized one important thing: My Maps is brilliant, but the company is letting this feature wither and decay.",

    "body": "A major court ruling last month found that SoundExchange doesn’t have the power to collect royalties through litigation. Now, the organization has launched an appeal in hopes of preserving this enforcement strategy. SoundExchange’s notice of appeal on Friday (Sept. 5) challenges an August federal court ruling that dismissed its $400 million lawsuit against SiriusXM. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald held in her decision that SoundExchange, a nonprofit designated by the Copyright Royalty Board to collect performance royalties for artists, does not actually have the right to sue anybody under federal law.
