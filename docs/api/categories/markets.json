    "body": "I suppose in an ideal world, games would launch and then never need updates at all, but I won't pretend I'm not just a little happy to live in a world where the original Stalker games are getting patches again. To rectify a few more issues with the remasters of Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, GSC has just released a 1.3 patch for the entire remastered trilogy . After two months in the oven, 1.3 brings all the stuff you expect: bug fixes, tweaks, curtailed crashes, but most importantly—Shadow of Chornobyl and Clear Sky now both have quick slots, just like Call of Prypiat. This is an incredible day. It's morning in the Zone. If it's been a while since you fired up CoP, those are the slots—bound to F1, F2, F3, and F4—that let you quickly use items in your inventory without having to pull up the whole equipment screen and laboriously sift through everything you're carrying. By default, they're set to use stuff like medkits, bandages, food, but you can drag whatever you like in there. It's a small quality-of-life feature, but its absence made SoC and CS just that little harder to go back to in the modern era, and having it across the trilogy is an unalloyed good. T…",
