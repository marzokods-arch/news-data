    "body": "Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate was released on July 15, 2025, and ever since then developer Bungie has been fire-fighting one of the expansion's many unpopular additions: unstable cores. Forgive the Destiny jargon, because this thing loves an in-game currency, but unstable cores are how you infuse gear, increasing its power level beyond the seasonal cap. The problem with the currency was relatively simple though, to the extent you wonder how it ever released in this state: it cost huge amounts of cores to do more or less anything at higher levels, compared to the small amount you'd earn for dismantling loot.

Bungie is now taking the opportunity, with the release of Destiny 2: Renegades on December 2, to correct its mistake. Having previously said it intended to \"rebalance the economy\" of unstable cores, it's now just admitting this was a bad idea all along. \"We have landed on a plan to fully deprecate this currency,\" says Bungie . \"Once deprecated, infusion…",
