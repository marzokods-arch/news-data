Joining her are Alix Wilton Regan (Alt Cunningham from Cyberpunk 2077 ), Doug Cockle (Geralt in The Witcher games ), Ciara Berkely (the new voice of Ciri in The Witcher 4 ), Ben Starr (Verso in Clair Obscur , that one meme where he is impassive and bright), and Shai Matheson (the upcoming Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight). Which game will end up taking home the Ultimate Game of the Year award? Well, that depends on the whims of democracy— voting is live now , if you want to make your voice heard—but it'll be one of 12 games on the official shortlist. Those games are: Blue Prince Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Donkey Kong Bananza Ghost of Yōtei…",
