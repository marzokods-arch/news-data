    "body": "After the huge success of the game's launch, Ball X Pit developer Kenny Sun and Friends announced three big updates to come in 2026 . Now the first of the trio has been dated—and we've had a glimpse at what it's set to include. The Regal Update is due January 26, so it's not long to wait at all.
