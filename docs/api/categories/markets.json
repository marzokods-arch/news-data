But no longer: \"As part of our clamp-down on those gold-farming bots and the harm they do to Old School RuneScape, we're now taking a harsher line against players caught buying gold from them.\" In other words, don't expect to get away with a slap on the wrist just because you were only buying gold or an in-game item from …",
