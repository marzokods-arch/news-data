    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A leaker has revealed more details about the Galaxy S26’s new 24MP shooting mode. The mode will apparently avoid image quality issues seen in the Expert RAW app’s 24MP mode. It’s believed 24MP shots will take roughly three seconds to process, but offer noticeably better image quality than 12MP snaps. We’ve heard for months now that the Samsung Galaxy S26 series could get a 24MP shooting mode via the Camera Assistant app. Now, a trusted tipster has revealed more details about this capability. Twitter tipster Ice Universe posted more apparent information about this shooting mode, corroborating reports that it needs to be enabled in the Camera Assistant app first. Once you’ve turned on this feature, it’ll be available as an option in the Galaxy S26’s default camera app.",
