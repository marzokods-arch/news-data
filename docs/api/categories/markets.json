    "body": "Credit: AssembleDebug / Android Authority TL;DR Google is developing a NameDrop-style contact-sharing feature for Android. We can now show you the slick animation that will accompany the feature and appear when two Android phones are brought together. We still don’t know the marketing name Google plans to use for the feature, but internally, it’s referred to as “Gesture Exchange” and “Contact Exchange.” Google appears to be moving full steam ahead on its NameDrop-like contact sharing feature for Android . Thanks to a new update to Google Play Services, we were able to surface a slick animation that accompanies the feature and shows up when two Android devices are brought close together to enable the contact exchange.",
