    "summary": "Get your PC purchases in ASAP, peeps.",
    "body": "Market analyst Trendforce is predicting that both the PC and smartphone markets will actually shrink next year as a consequence of the memory supply crisis (via Hankyung.com ). So far, we haven't seen any dramatic increases in PC system prices, but as Black Friday 2025 hoves into view, the question is for how much longer will that remain the case? Trendforce recently downgraded its expectations for 2025 from 1.7% growth for the overall PC market to -2.4% shrinkage. For smartphones, Trendforce revised its figures from 0.1% down to -2%. According to Hankyung, memory accounts for 25% of the cost of AI PCs and 18% of the cost of smartphones. Trendforce reportedly expects laptop prices to rise by five to 15% on account of the 75% increase in RAM module prices that we've already seen. Presumably if memory prices go yet higher, retail system prices will follow. Hankyung also notes that the price of 16 Gb DDR5 chips more than doubled to $24.80 per unit in the month to November 18 on DRAMeXchange . In response, bigger players in the IT industry including Asus and Apple are said to be preemptively purchasing DRAM (and also NAND memory for SSDs), while also discontinuing low-margin products.…",
