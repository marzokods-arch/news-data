This, along with it being WoW's 21st anniversary, is probably why Blizzard decided now is a good time to drop that $90 mount again. That's right—the $90 dinosaur mount is back. Notorious for showing up right after a controversial balance patch last year , the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur has been released from its cage and it might be the reason WoW Tokens are currently sold out in the UK.
