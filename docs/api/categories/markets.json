It looks instead to be a tease for the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Before Larian became known to the world as the developer of Baldur's Gate 3, you see, it was known to RPG nerds as the developer of the Divinity games. The series goes all the way back to 2002 with Divine Divinity, Larian's second game, and stretches to the 2017 release Divinity: Original Sin 2 , one of the best RPGs to come along in years and recipient of our 2017 Game of the Year award .
