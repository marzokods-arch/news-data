    "body": "Animator Bo Mathorne, creator of the 2011 animated short, Backwater Gospel, has revealed a new game project alongside developer Thomas Mygind: Skarven , a crunchy, lo-fi (but not too lo-fi) FPS inspired by narrative-heavy late '90s/early aughts shooters like Half-Life. Skarven's first trailer is all mood and light on action. The player approaches a lonely country house with an industrial mill looming behind. In Danish, a TV anchor drops some crumbs of world building as the player creeps through the house: We're seeing a rising retirement age and increased labor automation thanks to a Children of Men-style bottoming out in fertility rates. We pick up a chunky, Fallout 10mm-looking pistol, the TV cuts out, and a freaky, Nihilanth -type dude pops out to attack. I'm digging what I see, including an oppressive northern European dreariness, some great sci-fi/alt history scene setting, and stellar art direction, which pairs Mathorne's style with early aughts, PS2 vibes, but \"how you remember it.\" I'm reminded of Nightdive's approach to the System Shock Remake, which boasted high-fidelity assets paired with deliberately noisy, pixelated textures.
