The first Globe nominee for best original song to top the Hot 100 was “Strangers in the Night” from the 1966 James Garner film A Man Could Get Killed . The song appears in the film only as an instrumental titled “Beddy Bye.” Frank Sinatra ’s producer, Jimmy Bowen, indicated that the singer might record the song if lyrics were added and the title was changed.

We can now show you the slick animation that will accompany the feature and appear when two Android phones are brought together. We still don’t know the marketing name Google plans to use for the feature, but internally, it’s referred to as “Gesture Exchange” and “Contact Exchange.” Google appears to be moving full steam ahead on its NameDrop-like contact sharing feature for Android . Thanks to a new update to Google Play Services, we were able to surface a slick animation that accompanies the feature and shows up when two Android devices are brought close together to enable the contact exchange.",
