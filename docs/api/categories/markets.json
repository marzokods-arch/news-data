You're summoned to a hotel on a weekend when a seance is planned for All Hallow's Eve, and a whole host of varyingly suspicious people have shown up to participate. You've been hired to find a woman who checked into the hotel but apparently didn't check out, and the clock is ticking: you'll need to solve the crime before the end of the weekend and all the guests depart. As you explore the spooky hotel, talk to guests a…",
