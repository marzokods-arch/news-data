The giveaway went live, winners were picked, and all was good. And then the game got delayed to May 2019. And then again to 2020. And then again to 2021. In a sign of remarkable foresight, Level-5 then skipped a year to delay the game into 2023. And then, uh, it got delayed into 2024 before being delayed into 2025. It actually got pushed back again earlier this year—twice, in fact—shifting the release from June to August, and finally to next month. With the November release date here to stay, Level-5 hasn't forgotten about those who were bestowed a copy in its giveaway all those years ago.

Creative director Ed Beach provided an overview of update 1.3.0 in a developer video, starting with that civ-focussed balance pass. Exactly one dozen civilizations are getting a rework, namely Aksum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Songhai, Spain, and finally, Persia, which has been renamed slightly to differentiate it from a new DLC Civ. While the changes vary slightly between civs, the general thrust is the same. \"The majority of these adjustments are significant buffs aimed at strengthening these fan-favourite Civs,\" Beach explains. \"We're also introducing more specific bonuses to help each Civ lean into a unique playstyle.\" One example is that Egypt now receives \"tailored\" bonuses for building settlements and districts alongside river tiles.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library.

This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches. But it comes with a centimetre-plus of bezel all round, plus a pair of huge clip-on controllers. The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words. It's so big I have serious reservations about how realistic it is as an actual handheld device. I'm not sure I'd want to game with this beast in my actual hands for very long.

The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet. Essentially, if your access was approved, you could upload code to the little satellite (just 10 x 10 x 30 cm in size) and have it do stuff for science. Of course, there's…",

Warhammer Survivors is… well, it's Vampire Survivors but with Warhammer. But it's not just copying the formula—it's actually built on the same engine. \"Endorsed as part of the official Survivors lineage,\" according to the announcement, it's not made by original developer Poncle, but it is made \"in partnership\" with them by Auroch Digital. That's the studio that made the brilliantly charming Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun , so it's a promising team-up. The footage looks cool, perfectly translating Warhammer into the iconic Vampire Survivors pixel art style and throwing in gags and easter eggs for the hobbyists out there, such as including a pot of Nuln Oil paint as a weapon. Unusually, it covers both of the mainline Warhammer settings—the grimdark sci-fi universe of Warhammer 40,000, and the mythic fantasy realms of Age of Sigmar. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time a game has ever straddled both. It doesn't look like they'll cross over, however, which seems like a missed opportunity. I can ima…",

If there's one thing that can end your Minecraft session early, it's a Creeper. Fortunately, a mod has come to fruition that forces Creepers to ask you permission before they blow up, which is great for anyone lacking as much spatial awareness as me and doesn't often see them coming. As posted to YouTube by SectorFive , the Creeper Consent mod is exactly what it says on the tin. If you have a close encounter with the mob, just as they are about to explode, a screen will pop up, essentially asking you whether or not they can explode. Obviously, the immediate and only appropriate answer is no, which will make the Creeper disappear entirely when selected. Of course, if you let the Creeper do its business, you'll have to deal with the repercussions as normal, too. As satisfied as I would be with the consequences…",

The Ayaneo Phone just got its first-ever teaser on the Ayaneo YouTube channel , opening with the phrase \"When mobile phone meets handheld soul\". The marketing language isn't done here, though, as Ayaneo calls it \"a mobile phone truly made for gamers\" and suggests it will be coming soon. This teaser only shows the back of the phone, which includes two camera lenses and a flashlight, but it certainly looks sleek under the intentionally low lighting.

Pillars of Eternity's director, Josh Sawyer, explained and introduced the new mode in a new video on YouTube . Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire. The biggest deal, though, is that we'll be able to freely switch between turn-based and…",

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

For one thing, it's now on the hook for $20 billion in debt. For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

Asus has just announced the ROG GR70 mini PC, which stands upright and sort of looks like a small PS5. However, it is packed with a lot more power, with the processor choice of a Ryzen 9 9955HX3D , Ryzen 9 9955HX, or Ryzen 9 8940HX. NUC or Next Unit of Computing was a specific form of small form factor computer kits that was originally released by Intel back in 2013 (though it was shown off a year prior). In 2023, Asus took over the NUC product line and started creating mini PCs alongside Intel parts. Dropping the NUC name here is presumably a choice made due to the AMD CPU the GR70 is packing. Asus isn't dropping the NUC branding entirely, however, as the Intel-powered 2025 version of the ROG NUC , using the exact same chassis design, has been around since the summer.

Welcome to the Dark Place is a creepy single-player text adventure inspired by the likes of Zork and Kentucky Route Zero , which Zeekerss' has been working on for more than a decade. Speaking to GamesRadar , Zeekerss revealed why Welcome to the Dark Place had taken him so long to develop. Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained. This meant Zeekerss could implement his ideas very quickly. \"As soon as I think of something, it can be playable.\" But t…",
