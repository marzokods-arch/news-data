    "body": "TL;DR YouTube TV’s multiview feature will soon be “fully customizable,” letting viewers add any stream. Multiview has historically been limited to a relatively small selection of channels. YouTube TV will also get several “specialized” new plans this year. YouTube TV has offered multiview — the option to watch multiple streams at once — since 2023. Multiview was exclusive to live sports streams until last year, when YouTube TV started allowing select non-sports content in multiview layouts. Today, YouTube announced that it’s lifting more restrictions on the feature with an update in the near future. The announcement came in a blog post detailing YouTube ‘s priorities for the year. The post doesn’t get into specifics, only saying that this new “fully customizable multiview” is coming soon.",

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

It is also rolling out Gemini features to Gmail and Google Docs for Google Workspace Education users. Time and again, Google has endorsed the benefits of Gemini for learning. Whether it’s brushing up on new language skills , dissecting topics with Canvas , vibe-coding basic apps and web pages with step-by-step instructions, or even attempting to replace your real-life tutor . Google has now expanded its resources, particularly for students, with a new update, allowing them to prepare for college. Google has added the option to take mock SATs with Gemini. Google says these “full-length, on-demand practice” tests can be taken for free. It adds that, unlike the unregulated study resources, such as flash cards and mock quizzes, that Gemini or NotebookLM produce, these tests are rigorously vetted by prep test providers such as the Princeton Review . This helps ensure the test questions are accurate and align with real tests.",

The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite features a more compact and sleeker design, much like the recently revealed Communicator from Clicks. Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

Previously leaked specs suggest the device will feature high-end cameras: a 200MP “super large” primary camera, a 200MP “mid-telephoto” camera, and a 50MP 10x periscope zoom camera The phone is expected to debut in China and globally in March, marking an unusual international push from OPPO’s ultra tier. If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.

Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels.

If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

Back then, its Galaxy A54 5G challenged Google’s Pixel 7a as its closest rival, combining a triple-camera system and a robust 5,000mAh battery to win users away from the simplicity of Pixel UI and the reliability of Google’s image processing. By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",

We’re collecting feedback from testers to try and see just how widespread the issue may be. Last fall, Google scored a major win in its ongoing efforts to break down the walls between Android and iOS users, bringing iPhone-compatible Quick Share to Pixel 10 phones . That was a fantastic start, but there was still a long way to go in terms of expanding compatibility. Earlier this month we saw Google’s efforts begin to bring the upgrade to Pixel 9 phones in Android Canary , and that’s work the company has continued with its more recent Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 release. But as more users give QPR3 Beta 2 a try, we’re discovering some unexpected Quick Share problems. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

AYANEO held its first product sharing session of the year this morning, and it finally gave us a look at one of the most anticipated small gaming handhelds this year. The Pocket S Mini, which was first teased in September 2025, brings the ultra-premium all-metal design of the Pocket S series down to a size that actually fits in your pocket. The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

    "body": "Network Attached Storage devices are all the rage these days, but I’ve been using them for well over a decade at this point. I’ve got multiple boxes sitting on a shelf in my study, holding backups, family photos, my ever-expanding library of media, while also acting as my home server. It’s easy to assume that just because the box is sitting in my home or desk, it’s perfectly safe. I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions. Here is how I learned to harden my NAS and why I treat it like the most vulnerable device in m…",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is improving options for copying links received via Google Messages. Instead of copying the entire message and then booting the extra text, Google Messages may soon let you just copy the link directly. Google is also working on letting you edit Smart Replies before sending them. Google Messages already gives you a bit of an advantage when handling links. For instance, it generates previews for URLs embedded in received messages. However, when it comes to copying those links, it forces you to copy the entire message and then clip out the link manually. This, as you would guess, is inconvenient, but Google could soon bring a fix. Along with this fix, Google could be working to improve how you send Smart Replies.
