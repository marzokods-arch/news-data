In the clip, Lucy is up in the mouth of Dinky the T-Rex, the enormous plaster dinosaur that looks over the Dino Dee-lite motel and served once as the Dino Bite gift shop—as well as the sniper perch for Boone, the (unquestionably) best companion in Fallout: New Vegas. Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives. Little snag, I guess: Lucy, the former Vault-dweller, is a nice person, and is reluctant to shoot The Ghoul free while he dangles there at the end of the rope, much to his di…",

I wouldn't be convinced of this if it weren't for a preview image on the Diablo 4 website that contains something that wouldn't exist otherwise: a new flail weapon type. Every season you can fill out a battle pass of sorts that unlocks fancy weapon skins, and people quickly spotted a curious looking weapon on the info page for the upcoming Season of Divine Intervention. Under \"additional bonus rewards\" there's a flail alongside a mace and a glaive, and unless they're giving necromancers a new weapon type, I think we're looking at a clear hint at paladins making their way to Sanctuary immediately. It would line up with a bunch of other hints we've gotten in the past few months about what's happening with Diablo 4 at The Game Awards on December 11. Those include: An internal build of the game had \"paladin\" in the title before it got taken down earlier this year Diablo 4 developers urged people to watch The Game Awards in an interview last month Season of Divine Intervention happens to start right at the en…",

Well, sure: That sounds a lot better than \"media consolidation is going to make a few of us even richer and a lot of you even poorer,\" after all. But that is what we're looking at here. Once closed, the deal will give Netflix, a massive, multi-billion-dollar streaming and production company, control of just about everything in the Warner stable, including its film, television, and game studios, HBO and HBO Max and all their properties, and the whole of the DC Universe. The only thing not included in the deal is WBD's Global Networks division, which Warner said in June is being spun off into a separate massive media company .

To be more accurate, her exact words were \"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy. You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\" She added later in the interview that what Lucy and the Ghoul have is a \"really beautiful thing\" and said \"they're both looking for the people that they love; let's leave it at that.\" Much like Walton Goggins in that clip, who remarked he had never heard of this pairing with a beaming smile, Ghoulcy was not on my radar. However, there is a small but fanatical subreddit dedicated to the theoretical ship.

I'll be getting stuck in over the weekend—until then, however, I'm stuck here getting paid to write about videogames.

There's only one step that's likely to trip you up, as you help this corrupted abbess search for the Scholar in Limveld. The reason this step is so hard is because it's entirely inaccurate; the Scholar is actually in The Great Hollow event. I guess that's technically in Limveld, even though it's an entirely different map. As you'll quickly discern from the Remembrance entries, the Undertaker is a nun who started consuming the night corruption, hence the rather questionable screenshots circulating of her licking night juice off the wall while the Scholar watches her. Hey, who am I to kink shame? After you reach Chapter 6, you apparently have to defeat Heolstor in order to get the Dismembered Finger item, and then drop it next to the body during the ending. This should get you her Remembrance skin. I haven't done that bit myself yet, but I'll add details when I do. Otherwise, here's how to complete everything up to that point.

Well, not any more, as Nvidia has had a change of heart and it's back again in the latest driver set. However, it is worth noting that the new Game Ready Driver 591.44 drivers won't suddenly run every 32-bit CUDA program, as Nvidia has only added support for certain games. Fortunately, it seems to be all the popular ones that were badly affected by the CUDA change, as detailed in the relevant driver blog .

It's been one year since I first reviewed the (now Sandisk) WD Blue SN5000 , and boy oh boy, what a year it's been. That drive, at the time, didn't have a lot going for it. It was hot. It was slow. It was beaten by cheaper options, and thanks to using aging QLC NAND flash, it didn't quite deliver on the promises it made in a way that it needed to. Thankfully, the brand spanking new Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 I have here on review remedies practically every single one of my initial complaints. From a newer, refined controller to far more advanced (though still QLC) NAND flash package with higher densities and better all-around performance, it makes a damn good argument for being one of the best SSD s money can buy, at least if the price is right.

    "body": "Hytale is back from the dead and heading for an early access launch in January, but in an unexpected twist it will not be available on Steam. The absence isn't a Steam decision, though: Developer Hypixel Studios says it just doesn't want to be there at this early stage of the game. That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

As first reported by Insider Gaming , the layoffs impacted people in a wide range of roles—at least a dozen in total, according to a message posted by presentation director Timothé Lapetite. \"Eidos-Montréal got served with one of those Mondays,\" he wrote in a message posted last week . \"We had to part ways with some incredible talent due to *gestures at everything*.\" Sources also told the site that most projects in the studio have also been cancelled, and that it is now focused on co-developing projects including Grounded 2 , led by Obsidian, and the Fable reboot being headed up by Playground Games. Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March .
