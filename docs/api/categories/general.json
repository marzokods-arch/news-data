    "body": "Chet Faker has announced two new Australian headline shows as part of his ongoing A Love for Strangers world tour. The additional concerts are set for March 3 at Brisbane’s Fortitude Music Hall and March 4 at Sydney’s Enmore Theatre. The newly announced dates arrive amid an already busy touring schedule for the Australian singer-songwriter, who is also set to perform at Adelaide’s A Day in the Gully festival on Feb. 28, followed by shows in Melbourne on March 1 and Perth on March 6. The tour supports A Love for Strangers , Chet Faker’s forthcoming album due Feb. 13 via BMG. The project marks his first full-length release since 2021’s Hotel Surrender and arrives more than a decade after his breakout debut, Built on Glass , which was released in 2014. That album helped establish Faker — born Nick Murphy — as one of Australia’s most globally recognized electronic and alternative artists, powered by songs including “Talk Is Cheap” and “Gold.” New material from A Love for Strangers has already begun to surface, with recent singles “Far Side of the Moon” and “This Time for Real” offering an early glimpse into the record’s direction. The album is positioned as a reflective moment in Murp…",

    "body": "Credit: Ice Universe on Weibo TL;DR Apple is rumored to have exhausted its in-house options for a crease-less display for its upcoming iPhone Fold. According to a rumor, Apple might have torn apart the OPPO Find N5 to determine what makes the screen bulge so little. Apple is also rumored to be using a Samsung-made display for its upcoming iPhone Fold. It’s no secret that Apple is heavily invested in launching its first folding iPhone soon. It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands. Based on a rumor shared by a Weibo account with the username “Fixed-focus digital cameras ,” Apple tore apart an OPPO Find N5 while trying to decode what enables the screen’s crease to be so minimal.",

The Find N6 is expected to be a powerhouse with a 200MP primary camera, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and a 6,000mAh battery. The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete. Samsung won’t be the only Android brand launching two book-style foldables this year, as it appears even OPPO will join the party with its own wide foldable.

The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees. We’ve already seen the company increase its telco fees as recently as last April, but it looks like the company is doing it again. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
