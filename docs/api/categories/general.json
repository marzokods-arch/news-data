It was a rip-the-band-aid-off opening for a presentation that quickly moved on to what Ghost Ship's doing in the meantime: launching a new season for Deep Rock Galactic, its first since 2023, while it continues work on the roguelite spin-off for next year. \"At Ghost Ship Games we've realized we can't have our cake and eat it at the same time, and do everything ourselves,\" Pedersen said. That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

The diner is a noticeable upgrade from Phasmophobia's early days where you scoured barren spaces for otherworldly clues amongst a room full of stock assets. I recognized very little outside of the intentional tie-in to other maps, but welcomed the unfamiliarity. It's just scarier when you don't recall the same few books or plates hurled at you by an angry spirit. There's little attention-to-detail items strewn about the restaurant too, like a leaflet reference to Maple Lodge Campsite, spooky arcade machines to interact with, a functional jukebox, and cans of sprayable cream ghosts seem to love. I should know, as just about every haunted tour I went on with the game's developers went straight for fiddling with the cream. You can even hear the haunted hiss over the Parabolic Mic.

What better time, then, for the big fella to finally get his own tabletop RPG? As revealed by our friends over at GamesRadar , IDW Games will be launching a Kickstarter for the game in March. One promising detail is the talent on the design side—it's being written by Gav Thorpe, Jervis Johnson, and Mark A Latham. Those are three legendary names in tabletop gaming, particularly on the wargaming side of things. They've all done serious time in senior positions at Games Workshop on Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer 40,000, and more. Thorpe also worked on videogames including For Honor and Space Hulk: Deathwing, and Latham designed Modiphius' Skyrim wargame and The Walking Dead: All Out War.

But apart from the over-abundance of still-somehow-funny 'GabeCube' comments, what I've seen perhaps the most is people questioning why the Steam Machine has just 8 GB of VRAM. It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though. Even when games don't seem to be trying to use more than 8 GB of VRAM, that might be because they're choosing not to stream as many or higher-re…",

Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD.

There are many more reasons for that than Marathon, of course: Destiny 2 is in a big slump , while the studio has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs , and its CEO recently departed . But the mood music around Marathon is not great and with Concord in the rear-view mirror, one of the biggest live service flops in the industry's history, you sense a certain caution in the Sony executive suite. Marathon was announced with a (fantastic) trailer in 2023, but was indefinitely delayed earlier this year after \"passionate\" feedback. There was also, for good measure, a plagiarism scandal . Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao now says the company is \"fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule\" which means by March 2026: \"We will assume that we will launch this within this [financial] year, and that is …",

Even though these DLCs won't add any crazy new levels for you to roll around, they're just as exciting. If you jumped at the opportunity to start customising your character with accessories like I did, then you'll be thrilled to hear this too. Both DLCs will add five remix tracks and ten accessories each to the game. The first will arrive this month, adding five Dance Dance Remixes to the game alongside its mystery accessories. And, outside of the DLC content, all players will receive a cosplay set for Saki Hanami from Idolm@ster, which is potentially one of the greatest outfits I've seen yet in Katamari. I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay. Again, I'm pretty hopeful this will change later down the line as well. However, the second DLC coming in winter will give every player a set of DJ accessories which aren't just …",

Tune in via YouTube , Twitch , Steam , X , Bilibili —pretty much anywhere you can watch a video. How we selected the nominees Once a year, we send a messenger to The Council's secret lair and present them with a list containing the PC Gamer staff's top unreleased games. This is a long list of 100 games we're excited about. Some had fantastic teaser trailers, some have more Steam wishlists than ever believed possible, while yet more have flown under the radar of all but our most eagle-eyed writers and editors, and some are from fantastic developers who've already released our favourite games. That long list awaits you below, and you may notice there are fewer than 100 games on it this year. …",

I've bought almost every Meta headset to date, and unboxing the first one in the Summer of 2020 is definitely a highlight of my VR journey so far. However, Meta's dominance in the market is soured somewhat by Meta itself. Meta AI remains the unwanted present that just keeps on giving, the \" legendary misadventure \" of the metaverse is a multibillion-dollar digital eyesore, and, of course, it has laid off tens of thousands of employees in the process. And this all makes me feel that, frankly, Meta is too comfortable. The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra . Even then, Pico's hardware isn't available in the US and mostly just apes Meta, with very similar specs. Even if the Pico 4 Ultra were to take off and steal back that oh-so coveted market share from Meta, Pico's parent company, Bytedance, is just as data hungry, making it perhaps not the competitor one would want. Valve is a multibillion-dollar company too, but it stays in its lane more and seems content as a corporate entity to just se…",

Hideo Kojima will act as executive producer on the series while Takayuki Sano, who has a list of anime credits longer than Kojima's Hollywood phonebook, is on directorial duties. The lovely art that accompanied the announcement is by Ilya Kuvshinov (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045).

It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I think we can all agree on this statement: Dogs . Dogs are great, and it's a scientifically proven fact that any game can be improved by a factor of 90% by simply adding a dog to it—and that rises to 99% when you can pet that dog. But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

Worse, the Steam Deck took more than two years. But never fear: No such antipodean delay is in the cards for Valve's new line-up. Here's confirmation straight from Valve: \"All three products will ship in all the same regions we currently ship Steam Deck (US, CA, UK, EU, AU ) as well as regions covered by Komodo: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\" None have a specific release date nor price at the moment anywhere in the world, but are targeting early 2026. \"Specific launch timing and pricing to be shared sometime after the first of the year,\" Valve writes.

This time, a trademark for the name 'Steam Frame' gave away the Deckard project's real name ahead of our visit, but Deckard rumours have been rife for years. Some more accurate than others, but generally not miles off when you piece it all together. But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you.

These chips from AMD and Intel are the dominant player in PC gaming, so it only makes sense as to why. But in recent months, Arm support is seeping into Steam in a variety of ways. SteamOS will receive Arm support with the launch of the Steam Frame sometime next year. I don't suspect you'll be able to take that ISO file and load it onto any old Arm-based device right away, like a modern mobile phone, and have it just work.
