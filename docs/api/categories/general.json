    "body": "Taylor Swift ’s “The Fate of Ophelia” towers over all competition on the Billboard Hot 100 for a fifth week, encompassing its entire run on the chart so far. Of the superstar’s 13 career Hot 100 No. 1s, “The Fate of Ophelia” is her third to have led for at least five weeks. It joins “Anti-Hero” (eight weeks, beginning Nov. 5, 2022) and “Blank Space” (seven, Nov. 29, 2014). Meanwhile, following Halloween, Michael Jackson posthumously makes history on the Hot 100 as “Thriller” blasts from No. 32 to No. 10. With the song, which hit No. 4 in 1984, the late King of Pop becomes the first artist ever to rank in the top 10 in six distinct decades (the ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, 2000s, ‘10s and now ‘20s). Check out the full rundown of this week’s Hot 100 top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Nov. 15, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Nov. 11. For all chart news, you c…",

One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices.

Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other.

Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.
