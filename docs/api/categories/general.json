Data breaches frequently expose our private information to hackers, and all too often that info gets passed around on the dark web, ready to be exploited.

The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

This will allow Gemini to fall back on the Flash model, resulting in quicker responses. Google is already testing the feature with a select set of users. With the release of the Gemini 3 generation of AI models , Google’s smart assistant has racked up brilliant deep-thinking capabilities. However, the lack of a smart automatic model selector actively switching between fast and deep-thinking models — as ChatGPT offers — can result in Gemini taking longer and consuming more tokens for straightforward queries that don’t truly require deep thinking. An upcoming update to Gemini, however, could fix that, allowing users to manually override thinking and dial back to a quicker response.",

New code found in the Spotify app suggests a specific “Reduce animations” toggle is coming to the app. This feature could help users with motion sensitivity or those who simply find the autoplaying visuals too distracting. Spotify gives users plenty of reasons to switch over to its service . Features like Spotify Wrapped set up the whole year-in-recap trend, while the service has also been leaning into AI to help curate your next playlist . These additions have come at a steady pace, but the app also needs a cleanup — or at least, an option to disable some of the distractions.

That’s when farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and other states burn off plant “stubble” after the rice harvest. When winds are weak and the atmosphere becomes stagnant, the haze can push levels of air pollution several times higher than limits recommended by the World Health Organization .

This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

After all, you know what the distance feels like, you know when it starts to get hard, and you know what it takes to push through. And yet, when we try to set expectations in the world of smartphones, we’re so often left wanting more. We create lofty goals, and we’re confused and disappointed when they aren’t met. So, why do we bother setting expectations for Google when it comes to the battery life of its Pixel series ? I’ve used them for years, and here’s what it will take for me not to give up.",

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit.

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

AT&amp;T is taking another big swing at the smart home, and this time it isn’t going in alone. After shutting down its Digital Life platform in 2022, the carrier is back with a new security and automation system built on Google’s smart-home ecosystem and Abode’s professional monitoring. The company has announced Connected Life, and the idea is straightforward: you get a home security system that keeps working even if your Wi-Fi goes out or the power fails.

In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.

    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Earlier this week, a Phone 3 owner shared a screenshot of a response from the Nothing support team that stated the company “temporarily halted” the rollout of Nothing OS 4.0 to implement an “urgent fix.” A spokesperson for the company says that it uses a phased rollout for major updates to identify optimizations, which are often related to third-party apps. The spokesperson states that an optimization was identified and that the rollout across all devices is “progressing as planned.” Nothing OS 4.0 began rolling out to the Phone 3 on November 21 and days later to the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro. Despite the rollout starting last month, many Nothing Phone owners claim that they have yet to receive the Android 16 skin. After a screenshot of an exchange with Nothing’s support team was shared online, it was believed that the update had been pulled . Now Nothing has offered an official statement on the status of the rollout. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

At the time it was not clear if this change was even intentional, or what use cases it was meant for. In its latest beta, the Phone app finally adds an option to stay locked in portrait. Sometimes, it only takes the smallest change to how something works to really set us off. Earlier this year, Android users starting noticing an odd shift in the behavior of Google’s Phone app: It started supporting landscape mode , and would sometimes automatically switch over to it during calls. That’s not something any of us really asked for, and a horizontal Phone UI just felt all sorts of wrong to many of us who ran into it. The good news: You can finally disable it.
