Sure, melee characters, like Wylder and Raider, are getting big buffs to related passive effects, but I personally have received a huge buff because you can now rename your relic presets. Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\". Nightreign is finally playable. The relic system has been divisive from the st…",

Publisher Santa Ragione said in November that Valve declined to carry Horses because it contained \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione disputed that characterization, but an appeal was rejected and the ban stands. The Epic Games Store followed with its own ban on December 1, one day before Horses was set to launch.

    "body": "The MSI Forge GK600 is a tenkeyless (TKL) gaming keyboard, meaning it's missing the numberpad. But Katie, I hear you say, if a normal keyboard has all the keys you could ever want, what's the point getting rid of them in favour of a TKL board? Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE . Its dedicated navigation and direction keys aren't being swallowed up by the mass of other keys, so you don't need to fumble around for them, while the two-col…",

But what's really amazing is every single one of them feels completely distinct, fun to play, and truly super . I just wish Marvel Cosmic Invasion offered more for them all to do. In the vein of developer Tribute Games' last game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, this is an unabashedly old school side-scroller. Bad guys appear, you punch them until they're all gone, then you move a bit further right and more bad guys appear. Repeat until you reach a boss fight. Simple, nostalgic, satisfying. (Image credit: Tribute Games Inc) But as in Shredder's Revenge, more modern ideas enhance the action.

Since then, it's been gradually working its way through its post-release roadmap. There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

This is notable because Raspberry Pi SBCs (single-board computers) are normally very consistent in pricing. As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised.

This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder. There's no details on pricing or a release date yet but what I can tell you now is that, yes, in theory you could still take this chunky gaming handheld on a plane (though, you would need to check ahead of time what restrictions on 100+ Wh batteries may be in place for your specific airline). However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.

However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that.

Most Wanted is a little bit special, because we ask our council of over 120 journalists, celebrities, content creators, and games industry experts to vote on our 100-game longlist to decide what the 25 Most Wanted games are. This year, longlisted games include huge titles like Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, Resident Evil Requiem, and 007 First Light, among others. Our council is no less impressive, with members such as Tanya Short, Martin Wahlund, Dave Oshry, Terry Crews, Caroline Marchal, and Devora Wilde all casting their opinions.

If you need a refresher, here's a rundown of all eight episodes. Episode 1: The End In the year 2077, cowboy actor Cooper Howard performs with his daughter Janey at a birthday party. When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

A breakdown of the ownership between these parties wasn't given at the time, but as it turns out, one is committing significantly more cash than the others. According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA. The report lists some other finer details about the transaction, now public thanks to a filing with Brazil's antitrust regulator. $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost will be funded in equity, while the remaining $20 billion will debt.

The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often.

    "body": "I'd always assumed that Escape From Tarkov was just a catchy name and not something anyone could actually do—unless you're speaking metaphorically, I suppose: The bullet that frees you from the weight and horror of this cold, rotting world, and all that. But no, you can escape from Tarkov, and just over two weeks after the game finally went into full release, someone did it. That \"someone\" is Tigz, a longtime Tarkov streamer who accomplished the feat on December 1. Developer Battlestate Games confirmed on social media that Tigz was in fact the first to get the job done. A post shared by Escape from Tarkov (@escapefromtarkov) A photo posted by on When I first heard that someone had escaped from Tarkov, I immediately assumed someone was making a silly joke. The game's been out for eight years, after all, and if nobody's escaped yet, well, nobody's ever going to. But, as Tarkov aficionados are no doubt lining up to tell me, all of that time was spent in beta and early access: The full 1.0 release didn't happen until November 15 of this year, a major update that added—among other things—the \"non-linear story campaign and end-game content.\" So that's why it took so long for someone to …",

Weary of finding new ways to put Norman Reedus in videogames, the Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator is trying life on the other side of the (sort of) camera. He will be a large mole, which is also a name that could be in Metal Gear. No, really. Per Mantanweb (translated by Automaton ), Kojima will serve as the voice of Officer Paul Moledebrandt, the finest and presumably most visually disadvantaged member of the cop shop in the Japanese dub of Zootopia 2. Sure. Why not? Kojima did not, it seems, have to audition for the role, but was actually asked directly by Disney Animation Studios suit Jared Bush, CCO at the House of Mouse's animation arm. Why? Incredible question. Kojima doesn't say, but I like to hope Bush is just a massive Death Stranding stan. \"I’ve had many cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this is my first experience dubbing for an animated theatrical film. And it’s from Disney, of all places!\" said Kojima. \"What’s more, it’s the sequel to my favourite film, Zootopia! On top of that, I received an offer directly from director Jared Bush, so I was extremely honoured and accepted without hesitation.…",

    "body": "Under normal market circumstances, companies don't get into strained negotiations with themselves. But shortages can make foes of even the most familiar of computer hardware behemoths. Case in point, Samsung's recent negotiations over DRAM contracts with, err, itself. According to SEDaily (via Wccftech ), Samsung's Semiconductor Division (DS) won't give its Mobile Experience (MX) division—its smartphone division—a 12-month supply of DRAM. The latter will instead have to request DRAM quarterly. Y'know, because prices might rise quick enough for quarterly renegotiations to make sense. Yep, those would be Samsung v Samsung negotiations. Apparently, this \"comes as Samsung Semiconductor is restructuring its production lines to focus on high-margin products such as high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence accelerators and low-power DRAM for mobile devices, in an effort to maximize profitability.\" (Image credit: Samsung) It's surely the former that's the real impetus to restructure here, though. The Smartphone market is hardly exploding in new profitability . The AI industry, on the other hand… well, even the most cursory glance at the news over the past few months will have see…",
