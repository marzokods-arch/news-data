    "body": "NetherRealm audio director Dan Forden has left the studio after 15 years, where he's worked since its founding in April 2010—although since NetherRealm was a rebadged Midway Chicago, it's perhaps more accurate to say that he's left after 36 years. Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

Anything too obviously keen to impress, too overbearing in its affect, is intolerable whether quality or not. We want sprezzatura, elegance, and honesty, not to be hit over the head by someone very clearly trying to extract some very specific emotion. This is what I thought about as I played some Hotel Barcelona earlier today, which possibly tells you everything you need to know right there. A collab between outre auteurs Swery and Suda51, Hotel Barcelona should be right up my alley. I love Deadly Premonition (Swery), I enjoyed Flower, Sun, and Rain (Suda)—these are two great tastes that should taste great together. (Image credit: CULT Games) Instead, I mostly found my time with the game exhausting. Hotel Barcelona puts you in the shoes of Justine, a US marshal who shares her body with the soul of a serial killer, as she repeatedly murders her way through a bunch of monsters. This should not, ordinarily, be her job, but the guy whose job it was died when Justine crashed the car carrying them both at the game's start, so here we are.

I played a ton of it in 2022, turning my struggling medieval town into a profitable city thanks to investing heavily in bees—only to have my waxy fortune stolen by bandits in a suspiciously well-timed heist . Farthest Frontier also has a surprisingly deep farming system involving crop rotation and soil fertility, seasonal weather that will have you dreading those bitter and dangerous winters, and a whole host of horrible diseases and afflictions your settlers will have to contend with, like dysentery, scurvy, typhoid, cholera, frostbite, rabies, and even the plague. My townsfolk had an outbreak of worms at one point, which is utterly gross.

Which isn't very impressive, the observant among you may note, and feels all the more unremarkable now people are out here 100% beating Hollow Knight: Silksong on a saxophone. SILKSONG ON A SAX IS 100% COMPLETE!!! pic.twitter.com/4TmMhSuVUw September 30, 2025 By \"people,\" I meant \"Dr Doot—the guy famous for beating hard videogames with a saxophone,\" so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad about the whole thing. Indeed, we've met Doot MD before: that time he beat Elden Ring on his sax and that time he beat Shadow of the Erdtree on it . Plus, he regularly dips into games like Dark Souls and (the original) Hollow Knight to keep himself sharp. So I suppose I'm not too surprised, but I am impressed. Silksong hasn't even been out for a full month yet, and here this guy is literally freestyling his way through it in its entirety, on his first playthrough of the game. In a chat with Polygon , he explained how it all works. First up, I guess that thing isn't technically a sax, but rather an \"electronic wind instrument with the same key layout as a saxophone.\" On its back sits a \"mod wheel\" that …",

The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022.

Death to Chronos. Supergiant's first hotfix for version 1.0 is out now, and it's mostly a lot of minor fixes for issues like \"Olympian Keepsake effects not activating again after their Boon is skipped\" and \"Fated List Prophecies related to Hidden Aspects not clearing in specific circumstances\". I suspect some rebalancing will follow these patches, but right now one miniboss has been hit with a super specific nerf and I'm glad of it: \"Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants\". A couple of the minibosses in Hades 2 present as much challenge as the Guardians who act as each zone's bigger final boss, and the Phantom sure is one of them. This life-stealing mongrel heals after attacking you and isn't easy to dodge, especially when surrounded by allies and the flashy visual effects a typical fight in Hades 2 is accompanied by. This was made even harder if you'd selected the moon goddess Selene's hex that lets you raise the last enemy you killed to fight on your side. Setti…",

With Monster Hunter Stories 3, Capcom finally seems to be giving its RPG spin-off the scope and budget it deserves to really pop off. This light turn-based RPG series, which casts you as a young monstie rider instead of a monster hunter, didn't come to PC until last year, even though it debuted on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. There was potential even then, but the YA story and rock-paper-scissors battle system seemed guided by the mistaken impression that the audience for Pokémon-likes is still first and foremost kids, and not the thirty/fortysomethings who grew up with them. In the 45 minutes of Monster Hunter Stories 3 that I played last week at TGS, it tried to distinguish itself from the jump.

Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info…",
