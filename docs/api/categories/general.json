However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot.

However, as the November Pixel Drop came and went, the play chest was empty, save for a “feature” that’s annoying our Pixel users and many readers. My colleague Rita El Khoury received almost none of the new features on her Pixel 10 Pro and XL, except for the Wicked theme pack . Similarly, Joe Maring took issue with Google’s aggressive marketing, which paints a rather dim picture of future Pixel Drops and the infusion of advertising material within them.",

The behind-the-scenes episode documents the band stepping onto the biggest stages of their career, performing to stadium-sized crowds across the country as Oasis returned to Australian venues for the first time in more than a decade. The new video follows Ball Park Music from soundcheck through to showtime, capturing the emotional and technical build-up before the house lights drop. The band — who have long cited Oasis as formative influences — are shown tuning up backstage, taking in the scale of the stadium, and reflecting on the surreal nature of opening for one of the most culturally dominant bands of the ’90s and 2000s. View this post on Instagram “It’s hard to even describe what it feels like to open for Oasis,” the band say in the episode. “We’ve all grown up with their music and to suddenly be standing there, playing before them, it’s surreal.

According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters.

    "body": "If you’ve been daydreaming about a home theater setup but don’t want a giant TV overtaking your living room, Black Friday is the time to shop. Among the projectors currently hitting steep discounts, Aurzen’s compact Roku TV projectors are down to some of their best prices of the year. More importantly, both models currently on sale deliver far more portability than a wall-mounted behemoth. Aim either at a blank wall, and you’re all set for holiday movie nights. Aurzen EAZZE D1R At an approachable price point, the EAZZE D1R features built-in Roku TV for straightforward streaming without any extra hardware. It also packs 1080p resolution and Dolby Audio, plus auto focus and auto keystone for near-instant setup. Brightness lands at 280 ANSI lumens, which is solid for dark or evening viewing, and projection can stretch from 60 to 150 inches. That range should be more than ample for movies, gaming, or turning your space into an aggressively cozy virtual fireplace. Dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth round out the essentials. It’s an easy win for anyone wanting a plug-and-play projector that won’t dominate the room or the budget.",

The smart ring company argues that these brands infringed on several of its patents. These patents relate to form factor, internal and external components, and manufacturing methods. Samsung entered the wearable market last year with the launch of the Galaxy Ring . With the tech giant’s weight behind it, the Galaxy Ring immediately became one of the Oura Ring’s biggest rivals. Now, Oura is taking the steps to sue Samsung over its Galaxy Ring. And it looks like Samsung isn’t the only brand Oura has its eyes on. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Blass correctly predicted Pantone’s 2025 Color of the Year ahead of its official announcement, which is expected to come next month for the 2026 iteration. If this is the Pantone 2026 Color of the Year, Motorola could still release a limited-edition colorway of it for other Android phone models. Motorola and Pantone have a running partnership that’s one of the more fascinating Android phone collaborations. Pantone, the color naming and validation company, works with Motorola to validate the displays and cameras on select smartphones. The two brands also team up to deliver exclusive phone colorways, and we’ve seen Pantone-colored Motorola phones since 2022. Pantone picks a “Color of the Year” annually, and Motorola releases a special edition of a phone in that color. This time, Pantone’s 2026 Color of the year may have leaked, and there’s a twist.",
