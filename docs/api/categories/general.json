As has become a Billboard tradition, we’ve been spotlighting these Hot 100 first-timers throughout the year, celebrating their first appearances and sharing their reactions to the news. Now, as we ease into 2026, here’s a look back at all the acts who made their Hot 100 debuts in 2025 and the songs that turned them into Hot 100 hitmakers. The 2025 class of first-timers was particularly notable: four of the Recording Academy’s 2026 best new artist nominees — Olivia Dean, KATSEYE, sombr and Leon Thomas — earned their first Hot 100 hits in 2025. (Best new artist nominees Addison Rae, Alex Warren and Lola Young charted for the first time in 2024, while The Marías earned their first entry in 2022.) Dean debuted with her breakout single “Man I Need,” which reached the top 10, and followed with four additional entries. KATSEYE arrived in June with “Gnarly” and scored its first top 40 hit in November with “Gabriela.” Sombr hit the top 10 in November with “Back to Friends,” his first chart entry, and continued his momentum…",

Just five of the year-end box-office champs were films that were not part of franchises (or did not spark a franchise or a reboot of some kind). Those five films that stand alone are E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Ghost, Titanic and Barbie. Star Wars is the top franchise on this recap, with six installments that have been the year’s top-grossing film. Batman is runner-up, with four installments that finished first for the year.

Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses.

OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

Pixel 7 and older still have the older interface, even with the latest Pixel Camera update. Google debuted an updated panorama camera mode on the Pixel 9 that guides users through the process of creating a panorama shot using an intuitive AR-style interface. The feature had been exclusive to Pixel 9 and 10 until this week, but it’s now available on Pixel 8, too. As spotted by 9to5Google , the latest version of the Pixel Camera app adds the new and improved panorama mode to Pixel 8 series phones. Pixel 7 and older can also take panorama shots, but they do not currently have access to the updated UI introduced on Pixel 9 last year.",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

The same hardware used to adjust focus with professional cameras could be used with Galaxy phones. Samsung may initially feature this support with Galaxy S26 phones. Samsung just took home our Reader’s Choice award for the best phone of 2025 with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but will it be able to repeat that success next year? Even with Samsung’s launches still a couple months away, some of us have already been souring on the idea of the Galaxy S26 lineup , worried that Samsung’s gotten too complacent, and isn’t doing enough to keep things feeling fresh. Those concerns extend to the phones’ cameras, but even if we don’t get a big upgrade to camera hardware, we’re still spotting a few improvements on the horizon for Samsung’s camera software.

However, what if we told you phones made by Apple and Google had more in common than we already know? Despite the fierce rivalry between Google and Apple, both tech giants use the same manufacturer to produce Pixel devices and iPhones . It’s widely known that Apple does not manufacture its own products and relies on a Chinese-origin Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) company, Foxconn, to handle the bulk of iPhone production. In addition, it also contributes to manufacturing a part of the supply of the iPad, MacBook, AirPods, and even the Apple Watch.",

The Gemini overlay could gain a new “Tools” icon to house advanced features, such as Deep Research and Canvas. We’ve also spotted “Gemini Labs,” which could be a new settings area where users can toggle and test experimental AI capabilities. Last week, we spotted Google working on improving Gemini’s input box , giving it a cleaner and uncluttered look with fewer buttons. The look we managed to surface was clearly a work-in-progress, as the UI elements lacked proper spacing. With the latest Google app release, Google has addressed this UI issue and also introduced other UI changes that further advance the Gemini UX 2.0 revamp .

The Galaxy A37 could get a welcome main camera upgrade but retain similar secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A57 might not deliver camera hardware upgrades. The Galaxy A36 and Galaxy A56 led the mid-range charge for Samsung in 2025, but we’ve already heard a few leaks about the Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57. The latest leak has just outlined apparent camera specs. SmartPrix dug into leaked software and discovered purported camera details for the Galaxy A57 and Galaxy A37. Starting with the A57, the new phone is tipped to arrive with a Sony IMX906 main camera (50MP, 1/1.56-inch), a 13MP ISOCELL S5K3L6 ultrawide shooter, and a 5MP macro camera. The outlet explains that some regions might get the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ main camera instead, which has the same sensor size as the IMX906. A 12MP sensor (ISOCELL S5K3LC) will apparently handle selfies and video calls.",
