The change affects iPads, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G, and all Apple, Google, and Samsung watches. This move aligns T-Mobile with rivals AT&amp;T and Verizon, despite its previous advocacy for shorter terms. T-Mobile offers plenty of freebies and perks that keep its customers satisfied, but the carrier also frequently makes contentious decisions . For its latest move, T-Mobile is reintroducing three-year payment durations on select devices, which is somewhat surprising given the carrier’s previous advocacy for “Phone Freedom” when it transitioned from three-year to two-year payment durations.

While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it.

In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for.

It will feature a 4.7-inch 120Hz display and a Dimensity 8300 SoC in a vertical form factor. It could be officially announced as early as this week. ANBERNIC got a late start this year, but it’s been absolutely churning out new Android gaming handhelds over the past few months. The PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , the all-metal RG 477M , and the upcoming dual-screened RG DS are highlights, but leaks indicate that there’s a new device on the horizon. Renders and photos of an engineering sample of the RG 477V have leaked on the Retro Handhelds Discord . If they turn out to be correct (which is almost always the case), the vertical handheld will have the same 4.7-inch 120Hz screen and Dimensity 8300 SoC as the RG 477M.",

The Odin 2 Mini was one of the first to really fill that niche, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 packed into a relatively small frame with a 5-inch screen. But now, that device is no longer on the market. Confirmed by a representative on Discord , the AYN Odin 2 Mini has been discontinued and removed from the company’s website. This was not announced in advance, nor was it made public on any of the company’s channels.",

It then recreates fake banking app UIs to steal your banking data, and places restrictions that prevent it from being uninstalled.

A spokesperson tells us: Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect , which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVyfNGZUns I’ve been dipping in and out of classic game emulation for years now, but one trend that I hadn’t really appreciated until recently was the use of “spoof” APK versions that you won’t find in the Google Play Store. In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Pixel 10 Pro users continue to report jerky video when using the telephoto camera, specifically while panning. Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

    "body": "We still have a few days before Thanksgiving, but that hasn’t stopped Black Friday deals from going into full swing. There are some pretty great deals on phones, smart home gadgets, and more, but one of the best — by far — is this one I found for the Oura Ring 4. Earlier this month, Oura kicked off its Black Friday sale with a $100 discount on the Oura Ring 4, bringing it from $349 down to just $249 . That’s already a solid promotion, but what if I told you that you could buy an Oura Ring 4 for even less? How much less? How does $49 sound?",
