They share the same software with One UI 8, boast top-notch build quality, have great displays, top-tier IP ratings , and whatnot. But what started as a solid mid-tier phone that felt like a flagship without the flagship money is now becoming a less enticing deal. With the gap bridging, there are more reasons to spend that extra cash on the standard Galaxy S25 to get a better phone overall.",

    "body": "BMX is bringing solid-state tech to battery packs with a 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh solution. Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

    "body": "The Galaxy S25 FE has arrived, and there’s a lot to like about it. You get a powerful chipset, premium features like an IP rating and wireless charging, a promised seven years of software support, and a lot more for a starting price of $650. It’s a phone I’ll often recommend over the next 12 months because the FE series strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. However, it faces stiff competition from the Pixel 9a , Google’s mid-range phone, which — at least for me — is a better deal overall. Here’s why. Pixel 9a vs Galaxy S25 FE: Why I’d choose the former",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority Samsung is rolling out multi-monitor support in Samsung DeX, starting with the Galaxy Tab S11 and One UI 8. Extended Mode allows dragging apps and files between your monitor and tablet display. Launching with the Tab S11, this will reach older Samsung tablets with the One UI 8 update. Samsung DeX is one of the best desktop modes on mobile and has been a useful tool since it was introduced on the Galaxy S8. Samsung overhauled DeX in One UI 8 , basing it on Android 16’s new Desktop Mode, but there are more new features to come. The Galaxy Tab S11 gives DeX users a long-requested multi-monitor feature.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority In One UI 8, Samsung DeX no longer offers the full desktop interface on tablets unless connected to an external display. The updated version improves ease of switching between regular Android and DeX mode without closing apps. When using the standalone tablet view, traditional navigation buttons and quick settings are absent, resulting in a less mouse-friendly experience. Android 16 introduced Google’s take on a Desktop Mode for Android, and the new version of Samsung DeX is based on it. While some of the changes are welcome , there are some downsides to the latest version of DeX. The Galaxy Tab S11 series gives us our first look at the new DeX on a tablet, and some of these updates might not sit well with everyone.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Tab S11 and the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. The Galaxy Tab S11 replaces the Plus model in a more compact form but with similar power to the Ultra. The Ultra has a massive 14.6-inch display and is both thinner and lighter than last year’s model. Samsung is refreshing its flagship Android tablet lineup today with the introduction of the new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. These tablets come with incremental changes over the previous Galaxy Tab S10 series, and we’ll walk you through all of those. Let’s start with the immediately apparent change: the naming. With this launch, Samsung is eliminating the Plus variant — for now, at least — and reviving the standard Galaxy Tab S11, which features a smaller 10.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution. A similar lineup rejig is expected of the Galaxy S26 series , where Samsung is likely to eliminate the Galaxy S26 Plus and rename the base Galaxy S26 to S26 Pro.",
