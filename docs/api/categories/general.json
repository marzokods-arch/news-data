The most frequently called name for the nominations unsurprisingly belonged to Kendrick Lamar , who was already a big winner at the 2025 awards for his &#8220;Not Like Us,&#8221; and has nine nominations for 2026, most for his massively successful GNX album and its singles &#8220;Luther&#8221; and &#8220;TV Off.&#8221; Artists right behind Lamar include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, and Bad Bunny and Sabrina Carpenter with six nominations — with all four artists competing in each of the album, record and song of the year categories. How&#8217;d the Recording Academy do with capturing the year that was in this crop of nominees? And in what areas does it still need work? Billboard staffers discuss these questions and more below. 1.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube TV and Disney failed to reach a deal at the end of October that would keep Disney-owned channels on the service. Subscribers have been offered a $20 credit for the missing channels, and they remain unavailable. Now a report specifically identifies ESPN pricing as the hurdle that’s holding up negotiations. YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept.

This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better.

    "body": "When I installed Samsung Internet Beta for desktop earlier this week, I wasn’t expecting much. The Korean company is an established browser builder on Android, but that doesn’t mean its first desktop browser would be an immediate success. If anything, I was expecting a complete mess of AI fluff, unfocused design, and terrible performance. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Based on Google Chrome ’s underpinnings, Samsung Internet Beta is a breath of fresh air. It’s 2025, and the odd mandatory mention of AI features is present, but Samsung Internet isn’t an “AI browser” in the same vein as OpenAI’s Atlas or Perplexity’s Comet . It is far more traditional in its philosophy and offers excellent design decisions that improve upon Chrome’s usability, privacy, and multitasking capabilities.",

    "body": "Credit: Baseus If you’ve recently picked up an iPhone 17 or plan to soon, you might be due for an upgrade to your charger as well. Baseus is one of the biggest names in mobile accessories, and it recently launched its next-gen PicoGo series. As the holiday season rolls around, both devices are already discounted for Black Friday. These are among the first Qi2.2-certified products on the market, offering faster speeds, smarter magnetic alignment, and safer charging for iPhone and Android alike. Qi2.2 offers a max 25W charging speed, making wireless charging as fast as wired. iPhone 16 and 17 models already support it, while Android manufacturers like Google and Samsung are lining up to adopt the standard. For anyone who uses their phone as a work tool, camera, or travel companion, grabbing a compatible charger is a future-proofing move.",

That makes it 0.3mm thinner than the already slim Galaxy S25, and significantly thinner than the iPhone 17 and Pixel 10. This would be thicker than the Galaxy S25 Edge (5.8mm), but the S26 is expected to be more capable than the S25 Edge. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to launch early next year, and we initially expected to see the Galaxy S26 Pro instead of the base Galaxy S26. However, it seems like the base Galaxy S26 will make a return, after all. Now, a tipster has dished out apparent thickness details. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTuber JerryRigEverything peeled open the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro to reveal its wild liquid cooling system. You can actually see the phone’s blue coolant circulating through the whole system. The RedMagic 11 Pro uses an unfreezable, server-grade fluorinated liquid and a piezoelectric micropump to move coolant through a loop. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro , Nubia’s brand-new gaming phone, is already one of the most eye-catching Android flagships right now. However, it turns out that the phone’s hidden liquid cooling system might just be its most jaw-dropping feature. In a new YouTube Short, JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson peeled back the rear cover of the phone to show what’s concealed underneath, and it’s unlike anything we’ve seen before.",

It gets a lot right, but one missing feature is preventing it from becoming my main browser. There’s a lot to like Credit: Zac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority The feature I love most in Samsung Internet is the split-view mode, along with the sidebar. Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI. This has been great for researching and writing articles, as I can have my writing and two research tabs open all in one place without switching windows.",
