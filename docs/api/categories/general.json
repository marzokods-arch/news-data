According to leaker Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 series is slated to feature a minimum of 12GB of memory across its different models. While that specification is identical to the Galaxy S25’s RAM capacity, the upcoming flagship phones could feature faster memory.",

The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Frequent changes to product plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge and Galaxy S26 Plus have delayed Samsung’s design and production timeline.

Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back.

    "body": "Ever since I started reviewing robot vacuums, maintaining clean floors has become a compulsive obsession. Any sign of dust bunnies or other undesirables on my floors, and I feel the need to press start on a bot. For as great as robot vacuums can be, they have limitations, and sometimes you need a more precise tool to get the job done. One such contender is the Dreame H15 Pro CarpetFlex (), a flagship wet-dry vacuum with a self-drive system, RGB sensors, purpose-built interchangeable rollers, and an intelligent dust-suppression system. I’ve tested it for a few weeks around my home to see how it performs.",

    "body": "TL;DR Viwoods’ AiPaper Reader is the first E Ink device running Android 16. The 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display pairs with 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, 4G data, and a physical AI shortcut button. It is available now, priced at $279.99, from Viwoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Viwoods’ newest AiPaper Reader just became the first E Ink device to ship with Android 16 . While Viwoods isn’t the first brand to blend E Ink with Android, it’s the first to do so on Google’s latest software, a distinction that hints at faster updates and a push to make e-readers feel less isolated from the rest of the Android ecosystem. Specs-wise, the pocket-sized e-reader is built around a 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display at 300ppi, offering faster refresh rates and higher contrast than older panels. With a design that measures 6.7mm thick and just 138g, it looks more like a small phone than a tablet, making it an easy everyday carry for readers who want something portable.",
