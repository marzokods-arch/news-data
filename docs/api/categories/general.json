Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

Microsoft says it is growing and popular, but Xbox has been on a steady drumbeat of mass layoffs and studio closures in recent years. One of the employees speaking to Bloomberg cited the $300 million figure as an internal estimate. I've seen some skepticism about the figure, and a comparison to how publishers count every pirate download of a game as a missed sale when prosecuting pirates or commenting publicly on piracy's impact, but I don't think that quite maps on to what's going on here.

I had one potential recourse: An incredibly satisfying kick attack that ragdolls enemies and sends them flying, a perfect pairing with the instant death spike wall in one corner of the arena. Unfortunately, night had fallen, bathing everything outside a ring of torches in impenetrable darkness. I wish I could say I rose to the occasion and blind-launched this miniboss into the spikes, but the run ended in failure. I was better prepared next time, bringing a torch to set on the ground beside the spikes, letting me lure the knight to his death before he could land a single attack.

    "body": "GameStop is openly dismissing Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike, promising to keep selling subscriptions online and in-store at the old $19.99 per month rate, as reported by GamesRadar . The offer came just a day after GameStop joked \"own nothing\" when the price increases were announced earlier this week . In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, GameStop announced, \"We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online.\" A photo included in the post adds, \"You're welcome.\" We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online. pic.twitter.com/EAPGaud7cY October 1, 2025 How exactly GameStop is able to continue offering Game Pass Ultimate at the old price is unclear. What is clear is that GameStop is listening to the complaints about the price hike. In contrast, Microsoft is reportedly attempting to smooth things over by considering a free, ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming . Gamers canceled their Game Pass subscriptions in droves when the price increases were announced earlier this week, the most egregious of which was the new $29.99 per month rate for Game Pass Ultimate.

There's a good chance you haven't heard of The Wheel of Time. No, not the beloved series of fantasy novels penned by Robert Jordan, or the less beloved but still pretty good TV show cancelled by Amazon, or the recently announced and preposterously ambitious RPG . I am of course referring to the other Wheel of Time , the first-person spell-slinger developed by Legend Entertainment and released in 1999. The Wheel of Time was praised by critics when it launched, partly due to its association with the popular series of fantasy novels, but equally due to its decent singleplayer campaign and innovative multiplayer mode. Despite this, it sold poorly, fading quickly amid the torrent of first-person shooters that rushed across shelves in the late nineties.

Plus, like a certain Duke who gave his name to a certain rubber footwear, it also gives Napoleon a proper sorting out. Map generation is the primary target of update 1.2.5, with Firaxis responding to complaints that the sequel's landmasses were predictable and dull. To fix the issue, Firaxis says it has \"started from scratch and created a new base algorithm for making maps\" in Civ, while simultaneously introducing two extra map types. \"Continents and Islands\" serves as the new map default for single-player, mixing up larger and smaller landmasses of various sizes, while \"Pangaea and Islands\" situates the bulk of the action on one giant geographical inkblot, with splashes of separate terrain in and around it. As for those aforementioned UI improvements, these focus primarily on settlement development. The changes provide more detailed upfront information on the production menu, add clearer yield i…",

The big change to perks this year is the addition of hybrid specialities, alternative bonuses to the three main combat specialities that let you mix and match perk types a bit. There are also more perks at launch than last year (27 vs 21) and some existing ones have moved around tiers, but if you got comfortable with perk combinations in Blops 6, most of them will still work the same in Blops 7. There are three perk types: Offense (red), Stealth (Blue), and Support (Green). In Blops 6, these categories were called Enforcer, Recon, and Strategist to match their associated combat specialties, but now that hybrid specialities are a thing, they were given generic names.

Megabonk almost didn't look real at first: Its aesthetic is like some kind of 3D asset nightmare where skeletons pop into Mario coins and a fox wizard shoots fireballs at Piggsy from Manhunt. It's a crude mixture of pixel art and chunky 3D models that wouldn't look out of place on a TV in the background of an episode of NCIS.

According to reporting at The Verge, sources at Microsoft say that the company has been running internal tests of a free, ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a public beta test and full launch planned in the coming months. \"Sources tell me the internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming.

We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the-line rig or a PC that's seen better days.\" The delay message makes no mention of a new release target, nor does the Steam page , which now says only that Kingmakers is \"coming soon.\" That feels a little odd for a game that was due …",

When I first played the demo in May, I shared how I was getting to a point where I felt exhausted with decorating in games because of a little voice telling me it needed to be picture-perfect. After spending about half an hour with the demo, I was reminded that the visual appeal doesn't matter as long as you're having fun. Having now played hours of the full game, I'm pleased to announce this feeling never fizzles out and once you're past the first couple of islands.

The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",
