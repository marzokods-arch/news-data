MSI seems to agree, as it's just taken the wraps off the MSI GeForce RTX 5090 32G Lightning Z , a truly monstrous, water cooled, 8-inch screen emblazoned GPU that makes the regular RTX 5090 look downright pedestrian. It's been designed to 'completely ignore the concepts of balance in favour of extremes', according to the launch presentation I just attended, and boy howdy has MSI refused to do things by halves. Well, we are in Vegas , after all. For a start, there's an 8-inch display mounted to the card itself, which has eschewed a regular air cooler for an external 360 mm radiator with a three fan cooling arrangement. It's fed by a newly-designed pump that MSI says delivers 71% increased flow over previous GPU pump iterations, which is in turn attached to a full copper, full cover cold plate arrangement designed to keep things frosty. With a carbon fibre plate on the back, naturally. And frosty it'll need to be, as this beast is built to draw huge amounts of power. It's fed by dual 16-pin power connectors and 40-phase VRMs, with a dual BIOS system which allows the \"extreme\" variant to d…",

Alas, the durability of that performance does not mean that we'll be seeing Toufexis-as-Jensen returning anytime soon.

What I can tell you is that it \"delivers ultra-fast wireless performance,\" alongside lower power consumption, and the flexibility of hot swappable switches. So, if TMR isn't your thing for whatever reason, the MX 8.2 will allow you to swap between both magnetic and mechanical switches. If you stick with the Cherry MK Crystal Magnetic switches, you'll enjoy \"ultra-smooth linear input with 0.01 mm precision\" alongside an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The wireless, tenkeyless MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard will cost about $250 when it releases on January 29, though it won't be lonely in the lineup for long. The K5 Pro TMR keyboard—a follow-up to the wired Cherry Xtrfy K5V2 from 2024—will drop later in the Spring.

Rosen was a former US airman stationed in post-war Japan and the Far East, and after his service ended in 1952 stayed in Japan, first founding the company Rosen Enterprises, Inc., which sold Japanese art in the US market and also had a successful business in photo booths called Photorama. In 1957, the company's focus changed to importing coin-operated amusement machines to Japan, which proved lucrative, and establishing its own venues. \"Right off the bat, the machines were tremendously successful,\" Rosen told Next Generation Magazine in 1996 . \"At this point, I was opening up arcades with these shooting and hunting games throughout Japan, and we were fortunate… I don’t know [how many we had], but by the time I left, there wasn’t a city in Japan that didn’t have one of our arcades.\" In 1965, Rosen Enterprises merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, which used Sega as a brand name for coin-op machines: the name comes from a contra…",

You need to layer up properly so all your pointy metal armour bits don't hurt your delicates. It could have been even more persnickety. In a chat with PC Gamer , Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima recalled a scrapped system that would have seen Henry gain and lose weight depending on how much you ate, preventing you from wearing certain items of clothing and armour. \"Currently in the game as we released it, all men wear the same clothes you do… basically, you can put on anything that you find,\" Klima said. But earlier in development, Warhorse toyed around with a different system: \"Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you.\" But ol' Henry would be malleable.

Yes, it actually makes two of our top three best SSDs for gaming , though it's not as obvious today as one might expect. Essentially, SSDs under the WD branding are actually owned by Sandisk. The two companies used to be one and the same—with Sandisk a subsidiary of WD. However, WD decided to separate from Sandisk ; WD would focus on the lucrative HDD business and Sandisk would become its own entity focused on SSDs. The split happened in February last year. It all went off without a hitch; the only problem being the branding. Sandisk, now independent from WD, had the company's name on most of its best products. Today, that all changes. Sandisk is rolling out the 'Optimus' brand, which includes three tiers: Sandisk Optimus Sandisk Optimus GX Sandisk Optimus GX Pro Yeah, heavy use of the letter X and the word 'Pro'; nothing out of the ordinary for a tech brand here.

Asus reports the glasses can cover 95% of the \"human focus area\" with its 57-degree field of view. The one spec that gives me pause here is the FHD resolution (aka 1080p). With a screen being so close to your eyes and intended to give such a huge screen digital experience, this feels very low given how large the virtual screen will be. Still, the display is impressive, with the Xreal R1 AR being the first 240 Hz gaming glasses. A Micro-OLED screen should look mighty impressive, but font fringing is a worry on OLED panels, especially at lower resolutions. These are designed as gaming glasses, so that should be less of a worry, but it's certainly something I'd consider if I wanted to use them in a productivity capacity too.

At launch, that math held true. In three days, Monster Hunter Wilds had sold a triumphant 8 million copies—the fastest-selling launch in Capcom's history. 10 months later, the story of Monster Hunter Wilds has a very different tone. On Steam, its review rating hangs at a middling Mixed, having intermittently plunged to Mostly Negative when updates either neglect or worsen the game's profound performance issues. By July, its sales had collapsed—and after news broke that it had gone from 10 million launch sales to less than 500,000 in a quarter, Capcom's stock price plummeted alongside.

Is there evidence for this? Nope— quite the opposite, actually —but it endures because it jibes with the worldview of certain Fallout fans who see Bethesda as perverting the series. Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game.

You play through a domestic scene at home and then walk through the night to the village where all the monster-murder finally kicks in. They're characterful ways to begin a horror game, though they do put you off replays given all that slow-paced atmosphere-building only really works once. Resident Evil 4's remake would have had one of these intros, a Chapter 0 where you play Ashley in the moments leading up to her capture. You can see moments from it in the trailer, but it was cut at some point in development—perhaps due to complaints about how similar prologues messed with the pacing of other Residents Evil. (Capcom seems averse to giving players the option to skip stuff in replays, which you'd think would be an easy fix to the problem.) Thanks to modder and YouTuber Michael Kemp, we can see what this mini Episode Ashley would have looked like. Well, sort of. The leftovers found among RE4R's files don't include the cutscenes, the enemies, or whatever Ashley would have used to light her way through the dark, though they do include a couple of differ…",

Back when the patch was delayed around Christmas, developer Dillon Rogers said on X that the new revolver-rifle would help players \"tackle those pesky constable snipers.\" My experience with Gloomwood is limited, but I do love a stealth game with winding, open s…",

    "body": "I've spent the past several weeks mildly obsessed with Pluribus, the new Apple TV show from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. A highlight of the series is the arresting performance from lead actor Rhea Seehorn, who plays one of the only normal humans left after most of the world suddenly merges into an eerily polite gestalt consciousness. Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

That figure comes from an animated infographic AdHoc Studio posted on Bluesky earlier today, which is festooned with all sorts of stats (fair warning, it spoils some choices you'll be faced with in-game). According to the studio, players answered 727 million calls, dispatched over 1 billion heroes, and watched an estimated 23 million hours of gameplay on YouTube and Twitch. 💾 Clocking out on 2025🎆 HAPPY NEW YEAR! 🎆 — @adhocstudio.com ( @adhocstudio.com.bsky.social ) 2026-01-01T19:03:22.790Z That's all well and good, but I'm here for the funny tidbits—like how only around 164,000 players got through the game without falling for anyone. Nearly 2 million players romanced Invisigal and another million romanced Blazer, so maybe Baldur's Gate had the right idea with how, erm, eager its cast was to win the player's heart over. Videogame romance remains popular as ever, regardless of what you might hear elsewhere . Funnily enough, Dispatch itself was almost even saucier than it turned ou…",
