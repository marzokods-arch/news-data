Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

That’s why tablets make for great secondary devices, but choosing the right one can be a challenge. For years, I’ve been on the “bigger is better” train, using Android tablets with 11-inch or larger screens. But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

Spotted by the folks over at SammyGuru , it appears there’s been a significant improvement in the number of updates the Play Store can handle.

    "body": "T-Mobile’s T-Life app. Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A new leak suggests T-Mobile will push almost all major customer service actions into its T Life app by 2026. By November of this year, 92% of upgrades and 85% of new activations are expected to be app-based. The aggressive shift risks alienating both customers and employees if the app experience falls short. Just yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s current CEO will be stepping down in November, signaling a shift to an AI-centric, digital-first future. At the time, I suggested this would likely mean customer service would move further away from retail, as well as human reps. Now, a new leak on Reddit suggests this ramp-up is coming sooner rather than later. According to an internal roadmap released by a disgruntled salesperson, nearly 100% of major customer service actions will be handled through the T Life app by the end of 2026. This includes new account setups, line additions, and upgrades.",

The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR There’s a report of the Pixelsnap Ring Stand scratching the back glass of a Pixel 10 Pro. The scratch may be the result of dust or debris getting between the metal ring and the phone. The scratch appeared within 72 hours of using the ring stand on the device. The Pixelsnap Ring Stand has been making headlines lately, but for the wrong reasons. First, there was an issue with the screws becoming undone . Now, there’s a new issue that should be a little concerning for those who don’t put their phone in a case. When you choose to be a caseless user, you have to be extra cautious with how you handle your smartphone. Or else you risk your phone getting dinged up. But sometimes those risks come from unexpected places. Case in point, one Pixel 10 Pro owner was surprised when they found a scratch on the back of their phone presumably left by their Pixelsnap Ring Stand.",

    "summary": "Google could let Gemini just infer when you're asking about your screen, and here's how it will work.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google Gemini can answer questions about the contents of your device’s screen, but only after you tap an “Ask about screen” button. Gemini appears to be working on a new mode that would infer when you’re talking about your screen, and then automatically analyze it. Google would also offer settings to disable this functionality, so Gemini would need explicit permission to look at your screen. How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool. Today we’re checking out one small way that Google could make this screen-searching solution even more streamlined.

    "body": "Credit: CMF TL;DR CMF has released a new teaser for the soon-to-be-released Headphone Pro. The audio device has a feature called the “energy slider.” It’s currently unknown what this slider does. Nothing’s sub-brand, CMF, began teasing its first-ever pair of headphones last week. Called the Headphone Pro , there’s not much known about the device yet, other than you’ll be able to customize it with different earpad colors. With the launch only a week away, the company has now shared a new detail about its upcoming audio product. Similar to Nothing’s Headphone 1 , the CMF Headphone Pro will have an assortment of differently-shaped buttons and controls. Among those controls is a feature that looks a lot like a volume slider. However, it appears this slider may not be for controlling volume, as the company calls the feature an “energy slider.”",
