Sure, I think we can all see the utility of augmented reality tech mounted on a discreet, sunglasses-framed heads-up-display. However, I'm not sure many of us are comfortable with the idea of internet-connected, outward-facing cameras being pointed at us in public by the people who wear them. Well, should you be concerned that someone in the near vicinity might be wearing a pair of Zuck-o-specs , may I introduce the Meta Ray-Ban detector (via Hackaday ). This handy little device merrily lights up a sign emblazoned with the word \"glasshole\" whenever a pair are nearby, and the good news is, you can build one for yourself. This nifty little creation has been put together by GitHub user sh4d0wm45K, and they've even put a handy .gif of the device in action on the project page . It works by detecting the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' Bluetooth address via some custom code running on an ESP32 devboard, which then lights up two lines of white LEDs on a custom PCB whenever the specs are within range. You have to get pretty close, as you can see from the demonstration. It's unclear if the bright yellow bucket hat our creator is w…",

But Katie, I hear you say, if a normal keyboard has all the keys you could ever want, what's the point getting rid of them in favour of a TKL board? Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE . Its dedicated navigation and direction keys aren't being swallowed up by the mass of other keys, so you don't need to fumble around for them, while the two-col…",

But what's really amazing is every single one of them feels completely distinct, fun to play, and truly super . I just wish Marvel Cosmic Invasion offered more for them all to do. In the vein of developer Tribute Games' last game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, this is an unabashedly old school side-scroller. Bad guys appear, you punch them until they're all gone, then you move a bit further right and more bad guys appear. Repeat until you reach a boss fight. Simple, nostalgic, satisfying.

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

This is notable because Raspberry Pi SBCs (single-board computers) are normally very consistent in pricing. As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised. Here are the exact increases as Raspberry lays it out: Product Memory Old price New price Increase Raspberry Pi 4 4 GB $55 $60 9% Raspberry Pi 4 8 GB $75 $85 13% Raspberry Pi 5 1 GB – $45 – Raspberry Pi 5 2 GB $50 $55 10% Raspberry Pi 5 4 GB $60 $70 17% Raspberry Pi 5 8 GB $80 $95 19% Raspberry Pi 5 16 GB $120 $145 21% The biggest increases, proportionally, are hitting the 4 GB and 8 GB configurations of the Raspberry Pi 5.

This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder. There's no details on pricing or a release date yet but what I can tell you now is that, yes, in theory you could still take this chunky gaming handheld on a plane (though, you would need to check ahead of time what restrictions on 100+ Wh batteries may be in place for your specific airline). However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.

And while gaming mouse docks are often disregarded as a novelty or even a gimmick, it's hard to deny their practicality. I mean, plugging in ? In 2025? Why waste my energy on something so tedious? Thankfully, the MSI Versa Pro Wireless gaming mouse and Mouse Dock Pro are all about the path of least resistance. Since the world is now moving into some strange, AI-fuelled Edo period I'm betting the use of gaming mouse docks will start to see a resurgence, too. Alright, better prep yourself for further laziness productivity rants as we get into why the MSI Versa Pro Wireless and Mouse Dock Pro is quickly becoming my new favorite gaming accessory duo. Aside from the huge, lit-up logo and RGB-studded side panels there's a certain sleek simplicity to the Versa Pro and Mouse Dock Pro.

However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that. Fortunately, the newest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, has unleashed what I can only describe as the best method of transport for a game like this: horses. That's right, if you're someone who grew up wanting to be a princess and asking for a pony every Christmas, then Disney Dreamlight Valley has finally answered your wishes. Within the Wishblossom Ranch DLC you'll be able to befriend numerous horses too, rather than just being lumped with one.

If you need a refresher, here's a rundown of all eight episodes. Episode 1: The End In the year 2077, cowboy actor Cooper Howard performs with his daughter Janey at a birthday party. When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA. The report lists some other finer details about the transaction, now public thanks to a filing with Brazil's antitrust regulator. $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost will be funded in equity, while the remaining $20 billion will debt.

Santa Ragione filed an appeal, but it was rejected 12 hours later with no further explanation. Epic also indicated the game could be updated to bring it into compliance, but \"the email did not include any information on what would need to be changed,\" Santa Ragione said, and even if it had there'd be no way to make extensive changes one day ahead of release. Epic was not more forthcoming on the matter in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"We set clear guidelines for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violati…",

The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often.

That means Monitors Unboxed isn't using it for gaming but the daily computing grind with lots of static content for eight hours a day. The channel also only runs MSI's OLED panel compensation cycle at the end of the eight hour working day, not at the four-hour intervals that MSI recommends. The idea, in other words, isn't to baby this monitor but use it just as you would an LCD panel. And you don't have to break off from work in the middle of the day for 10 minutes to run compensation cycles on LCD monitors.

How young and naive I was—as we speak, multiple games north of 100, even 200 GB are manspreading across my disks. But that number just decreased by one. In an update on Steam , Arrowhead announced that it has performed some manner of warlockery and reduced the footprint of Helldivers 2 by 85%. \"By completely de-duplicating our data, we were able to reduce the PC installation size from ~154GB to ~23GB, for a total saving of ~131GB (~85%).\" This is, as Arrowhead itself notes, closer to (or actually, better than) the game's install size on consoles, where it's around 35 GB or so, and it does beg the question as to just how much duplicated data the studio had cluttering up the joint. Were we all accidentally installing the game six times? And how many other space-hogs on my SSD could pull this same trick if they did their legwork? Well, don't read too much into it. As we covered a little while ago, Helldivers 2 duped a load of info specifically to make life easier for clattery old mechanical hard drives . I su…",

But it's true: the game is closing in on its third Christmas and, to mark the occasion, Larian has paid tribute to some of the over 10,000 mods that people have created for it. Yes, Withers' Big Naturals are in there. In a community update on Larian's website , the studio said that \"before we close out on 2025, we’re looking back at some of the best moments brought about by your mods!\" Mods which have \"caused tears, laughter, and pain. Lots of pain. Like getting rammed in the ankles by a muscle car pain.\" In particular, it's called out a set of mods used by Larian's Aoife Wilson in the studio's own streams of the game . I strongly encourage you to check out the full list and the entire Mod.io collection Larian put together of the ones it's been using, but my personal favourite of the whole bunch has gotta be Car Wildshape . \"Gives the ability to any player character to turn into a car,\" reads the mod's own description, in a tone which I can't help b…",

    "body": "I'm not sure I love that we've started flippantly calling it 'the memory apocalypse,' but given just how much hardware this peaking pricing could affect, it does feel fitting. Motherboard sales are apparently just the latest victim, with some retailers apparently seeing a devastating year-on-year decline. According to Hong Kong hardware site, HKEPC , a number of Chinese media reports claim that major motherboard manufacturers—including MSI, Gigabyte, and Asus—have seen motherboard sales drop up to 50% compared to figures from November and December 2024. HKEPC suggests this drop in Motherboard sales is due to DRAM prices beginning to rise in October , putting off would-be PC upgraders at a time when we'd normally see a bunch of enthusiasts making new purchases. The report goes on to further predict that this will have a subsequent knock-on effect for CPU sales before long. HKEPC observes that gamers are spending their funds elsewhere, with sales figures for gaming peripherals (such as gaming mice and controllers) alongside monitors being much less affected. HKEPC reports that many users online have either postponed or simply downsized their PC hardware upgrade plans as a result of …",
