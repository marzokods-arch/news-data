    "body": "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere has received mixed reviews from critics, and has gotten off to a slower-than-expected start at the boxoffice, but as of Sunday (Nov. 23) it has grossed $42.8 million worldwide, according to boxofficemojo.com . That puts it at No. 20 on Billboard ‘s list of music biopics with the highest worldwide grosses. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska .
