Acer announced the Acer 4K UHD Google TV Streaming Box in South Africa late last year, and this looked like the answer to my prayers. This Google TV box is made by prominent ODM SEI Robotics, but a closer look revealed that it easily met my requirement for more ports.

    "body": "TL;DR Some Android Auto users report Google Maps losing the car icon when switching back to split-screen mode. Navigation still works, but the car marker disappears until Maps is force-closed on the phone. Several users say switching back to the default blue arrow icon may stop the issue, at least for now. Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

A new report now reveals how big a financial hit Disney’s sports broadcasting arm suffered due to the blackout. ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November .

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority Amazon has always held a tight grip over the software that runs on its devices, and the company’s Echo line of smart speakers and displays is no different. In fact, it’s much more locked down than the Kindle Fire tablets that allow you to sideload regular Android apps. The Echo line doesn’t enjoy that privilege. But thanks to a new open-source project, you can now jailbreak select Echo Show 5 and Show 8 models and replace Amazon’s locked-down Fire OS with full-fledged Android. Under the hood, Amazon’s smart displays pack similar specifications as mainstream Android devices. For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1. However, Amazon has never permitted unlocking the bootloader on its smart displays, keeping us locked to the Alexa-centric Fire OS ecosystem.",

International models are tipped to get a 6,000mAh battery, while China gets a much larger 6,800mAh cell. Global buyers may also get fewer color options, missing out on China’s exclusive light purple variant. If you were expecting the global Xiaomi 17 Ultra to be a no-compromise flagship, here’s a reality check. It looks like it will be expensive and a bit less feature-packed than the version sold only in China. A recent leak on X from Arsène Lupin says the upcoming Xiaomi flagship will cost €1,499 in Europe for the 16GB RAM and 512GB storage model. That puts it in the same ultra-premium range as top Samsung and Apple phones.",

With its second foldable, Apple may be considering a more traditional clamshell design, similar to the Galaxy Z Fold or the Motorola Razr. There are no concrete plans yet, and this phone may not arrive anytime soon. Apple has a few new form factors that it has long reported to be working on. The most buzzworthy is the iPhone Fold , which is expected to debut alongside the iPhone 18 later at Apple’s yearly September event. Much before its launch, the iPhone Fold is already shaping trends with its unusual “wider” aspect ratio and driving Android brands to adopt the same . Apple’s next foldable, however, could be far more conventional. While the first Apple foldable has yet to hit the shelves, the industry is buzzing with speculation about the second. Bloomberg ‘s Mark Gurman notes that Apple has begun considering its second foldable, which will align with what brands like Samsung and Motorola have been doing for over half a decade. Gurman, in the latest edition of his weekly newsletter , says that the next foldable devic…",

I decided she needed a replacement, but we agreed it didn’t necessarily need to be a top-tier flagship. We settled on the Galaxy S25 FE (), which I was able to get for under $500. From the moment we set it up, I noticed how familiar this phone felt to my own Galaxy S24, inside and out. After setting it up, I didn’t dwell on it much until about a week or two later, when I asked my daughter if she was okay with the phone still. Her response was that, if anything, it felt like a big upgrade over her Galaxy S22 in terms of battery life, and she appreciated the larger display.",

The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",
