I suspect some rebalancing will follow these patches, but right now one miniboss has been hit with a super specific nerf and I'm glad of it: \"Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants\". A couple of the minibosses in Hades 2 present as much challenge as the Guardians who act as each zone's bigger final boss, and the Phantom sure is one of them. This life-stealing mongrel heals after attacking you and isn't easy to dodge, especially when surrounded by allies and the flashy visual effects a typical fight in Hades 2 is accompanied by.

With Monster Hunter Stories 3, Capcom finally seems to be giving its RPG spin-off the scope and budget it deserves to really pop off. This light turn-based RPG series, which casts you as a young monstie rider instead of a monster hunter, didn't come to PC until last year, even though it debuted on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. There was potential even then, but the YA story and rock-paper-scissors battle system seemed guided by the mistaken impression that the audience for Pok√©mon-likes is still first and foremost kids, and not the thirty/fortysomethings who grew up with them. In the 45 minutes of Monster Hunter Stories 3 that I played last week at TGS, it tried to distinguish itself from the jump.

Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info‚Ä¶",

Griffin pleaded guilty to \"threatening interstate commerce\", a charge brought because Epic Games is headquartered in North Carolina, and could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in federal prison, fined up to $250,000, or a combination of the two. Even should he avoid jail or get a minimal sentence, he faces up to three years of supervised release. Those are some potentially life-changing penalties, and should certainly give a certain breed of keyboard warrior pause for thought. A court document filed on September 16, 2025, contains the following statement from Griffin: \"I sent messages to Epic Games, where I threatened to kill employees of the company.

Before you start, you'll need the Beauty and the Beast realm already unlocked and both Belle and the Beast living in your valley . Once done, you'll receive a letter in your mailbox from the Beast regarding his friends, Cogsworth and Lumiere, at the castle.

As always though, the first round of information includes some exciting additions the game can expect, but doesn't expose a lot of details like a release date. Luckily the official blog post about the drop, alongside the announcement at Minecraft Live 2025, has still given us plenty of information to dissect. As the title suggests, this update is all about adding new mounts to the game and a few items to improve the experience you currently have with mounts. As it stands, you're only able to ride horses, donkeys, mules, camels and pigs in Minecraft, so it'll be nice to shake things up and get new mounts to help you traverse open stretches of water as well as just land. Especially now you can craft a saddle. Here's everything we currently know about the Mounts of Mayhem update. When will the Mounts of Mayhem update be released in Minecraft? The Mounts of Mayhem update doesn't have a release date yet, and seeing as the Copper Age drop just launched, it will be a few months before we see the next update rolled out.

Luckily, it's not too challenging to gather as long as you've got the right tools and know where to look. A good way to start your hunt for honeycomb is by looking for bees, which spawn most frequently in meadow biomes. Venture to your nearest one, and you can start following them to their hive. But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead. Where to find honeycomb in Minecraft The key to gathering honeycombs is by locating a bee nest. But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured. When you've found one, walk up to it and use shears, and up to three honeycombs will drop. Shearing a nest or hive will anger the bees inside‚Ä¶",
