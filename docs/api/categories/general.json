In July, CEO Daniel Ek said he was “unhappy” with the company’s advertising business, and executives laid out their efforts to turn it around.

The move to allow free streamers to choose their songs rather than listen on shuffle mode was more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with free, ad-supported music isn’t confined to Spotify, though. Around the world, streaming revenue from audio and video supported by advertising fell sharply in the first half of the year.

We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

The hardware is scheduled to launch in March 2026. Today, AYANEO launched the Pocket AIR Mini , providing a full look at the device, its specs, and price. In addition to this launch, however, the company had a surprise up its sleeve that we didn’t see coming. This surprise is a different handheld that is slated for early next year. While details are light at the moment, AYANEO did volunteer some information about the hardware. Clearly inspired by the Pocket S in both design and name, the device is called the AYANEO Pocket S Mini. As AYANEO describes it, the Pocket S Mini is a “high-performance retro 4:3 handheld.”",

Finding the right app in the Google Play Store can sometimes feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, but AI can actually be handy for this sort of thing. Google is now testing a new Gemini-powered way to simplify discovery, and it’s already rolling out for some US accounts.

Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones.

For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation.

The software brings several key improvements, like expressive design, enhanced protection against malicious apps, and more transparent background activities. Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 8, based on Android 16, to the Galaxy S25 series . But Samsung isn’t the only brand rolling out the new Android OS to its devices this week. Motorola is also getting the ball rolling with a couple of its handsets. The stable version of Android 16 is starting to arrive on some Motorola phones. The first devices getting the software are the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (via YTECHB ) and the Edge 50 Fusion (via Gizmochina ). On top of that, it seems the release is only happening in specific markets at the moment, which include Brazil for the Edge 60 Pro and Mexico for the Edge 50 Fusion. It appears Motorola is taking a phased approach to its rollout before the broader release.",

Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

    "body": "Earlier this summer, Android Authority revealed a potentially huge shakeup for Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series . Instead of the expected Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra lineup, we found evidence that Samsung’s 2026 Galaxy S family may consist of the Galaxy S26 Pro, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra. The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung. Where the base model Galaxy S has long felt overlooked and underpowered, the new “Pro” moniker led me to believe that the Galaxy S26 Pro could be the true compact flagship phone I’ve wanted from Samsung for so long.",

The prices of these devices appear to be marked up compared to the market value of refurbished phones. You’re better off buying these devices directly from Apple or renowned sellers like Amazon, even if you want to use Trump Mobile’s service. Trump Mobile’s “Proudly American” T1 Phone is far from being available to American consumers. The carrier, backed by the Trump Organization, has been experimenting with various designs for the golden-embellished phone, and the original timeline has since been revised . The T1 Phone was initially promised to launch in September. However, the delivery date was shifted to sometime “later this year” when the organization rescinded its “Made in America” claim . With only a vague timeline for the T1 Phone, Trump Mobile has started selling refurbished phones.",
