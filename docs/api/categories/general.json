It is available now in China, with global release not yet confirmed. Credit: Boox For anyone after the distraction-free charm of E-Ink in a more portable package, Onyx Boox just announced the Note X5 Mini, a compact tablet that pairs a 7.8-inch E-Ink Carta 1300 display (300 ppi) with stylus support and a built-in DeepSeek AI assistant. Unlike the oversized Note Air 4 Pro and other productivity-heavy slates, the Mini is designed for mobility. It slips into a bag while still offering a paperlike display for reading, jotting notes, and sketching.",

OnePlus handsets have been among the better Android options for some time now, but the OnePlus 13 strikes a particularly special balance in its design, performance, cameras, and software.

We’ve had tons of news about the OnePlus 15 over the last few days, and a lot of what we’ve heard sounds quite promising. But despite all of that, I still have this concern that the OnePlus 15 will lack what makes its predecessor so special.

He and his ace band played hit after hit with no sign at all from McCartney of fatigue for songs some of which he’s sung for more than 60 years. He still exudes a school-boy charm. Not to be too hyperbolic—well, ok, to be hyperbolic—watching the greatest musician of the 20 th century sing the Beatles’ first hit, 1963’s “Love Me Do,” 62 years later with the same innocent abandon as the original was nothing short of exhilarating and it felt like a miracle that he is still here delivering at such a high quality.

Considering how easily your smartphone snaps a picture, shoots a video, or records a voice memo, it should be a lot more shocking than it is that so many Android users still struggle to access basic voice call recording. A complicated legal framework certainly doesn’t help matters any, but a few weeks back we found ourselves newly hopeful that things were getting better, as Google updated its support documentation to indicate that call recording was coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices. Despite that change, reports of users actually getting access were hard to come by — was this happening or not? Today, we’re finally getting some insight into what Google’s up to.

We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.

The company has shared images of a new Sand Dune colorway alongside details about the phone’s build. The design reveal includes an image of the phone’s display with a date, which could very well be when the company plans to officially launch the phone. The OnePlus 15 is no longer a mystery. Last week, the company showed off the device at the Snapdragon Summit in China, which was followed by an early review of the phone by YouTuber Geekerwan. Now, OnePlus is showing off its upcoming flagship from all angles in a fresh set of images released on Chinese social media platform Weibo . The teasers not only give us a glimpse at a brand new colorway for the OnePlus 15, but also strongly hint at the phone’s launch date.",

The finance sector, particularly high-frequency trading, has been using AI and machine learning for a while now. Custom AI solutions are also used for predictive analytics and portfolio automation. However, those tools depend on highly specialized in-house AI tools. What I’ve been wondering is — can a general-purpose AI like Google Gemini be optimised to perform similar functions? I was curious to know if an AI model could make sense of my investments, identify risks, and maybe even suggest strategies that were worth testing. A few months ago, I decided to run a small experiment. Instead of blindly following every piece of advice from my portfolio advisor, I wanted to see what would happen if I brought Google’s Gemini AI into the mix. My idea was pretty straightforward.

For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another.

I’d go so far as to say that we’re in a golden age of small Android phones — or small phones in general. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 has settled at 6.2 inches, the iPhone 17 is a slightly larger 6.3, and even Google has a Pro-level Pixel with just a 6.3-inch display. And you know what? They’re all really good.

One of the little quirks of a Google Messages group chat is that once you set a picture as the group icon, you can’t go back. You can swap it for another photo, but there’s no way to remove it entirely and return to the default look. That might be about to change.

Not only do you want to keep users happy, always endeavoring to improve compatibility and stomp out bugs, but you’ve got to avoid pissing off big companies who could seriously undermine your efforts, whether those are console manufacturers themselves or the people behind app stores.

Though Facebook and Instagram will still collect the kinds of personal user data they use to target ads, no ads will be displayed to users enrolled in the new payment program. New paid options are meant to address the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office consent or pay guidance that says online services must allow users to pay a fee in order to “avoid their personal information being used for personalised advertising” — exactly what Meta is doing here. For now, the option is exclusive to the UK. UK-based users are getting options to pay £2.99 (~$4) a month to opt out of ads on the web, or £3.99 (~$5) a month to remove ads from the Facebook and Instagram mobile apps. But of course, the traditional social media business model is built on ad revenue, and ads on Instagram and Facebook are pervasive in all markets.",

Google’s Clock app is one of the better timekeeping apps available for Wear OS. If you want to install it on your device, you may run into a bit of trouble if you have a non-Pixel smartwatch. It appears the app has recently gone missing from the Play Store for these users. We have spotted multiple reports from non-Pixel smartwatch owners that Google’s Clock app is no longer available for installation from the Play Store. These reports span across Reddit , Google’s support page , and reviews in the app’s Play Store listing .

Numerous reports indicate that watching a single channel appears fine, but the quality severely degrades when watching two, three, or four channels at once. This is reportedly happening even with fast, wired internet connections and with other streaming apps running fine, suggesting it may be an issue with YouTube TV itself. YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",
