Mouselook or dual analogue control mods can sometimes make a classic more approachable, but other times it's like you used AI to \"improve\" the Mona Lisa or something. Caput Mortem gets this, and makes the controls one of your primary enemies, elevating a pretty good horror game to a truly memorable one. Caput Mortem's idiosyncratic controls, partly lifted from King's Field, FromSoftware's pre-Dark Souls first-person dungeon crawlers, had me hooting from the start. It's a \"we were still figuring out first-person on gamepad\" sort of deal: You look left and right with the triggers and up and down with the bumpers, swiveling your head like you're dialing in a WW2 anti-aircraft gun.

Unless, that is, you actually enjoy map reading and inferring your location through local landmarks—I doff my hat to you if so. The good news is that if you miss a map in Silksong and fail to find resident cartographer Shakra in her new spot, then you can still get the map quite easily. All you need to do is head back to Bone Bottom, jump up the platforms marked with gold rings on the right side of the town and hit the ring tied to the post in Shakra's usual spot two times . This will make Shakra return, where she'll offer you whatever map you somehow managed to miss. Similar to Cornifer in Hollow Knight, Shakra is on her own journey through Pharloom, so she can jump around to new locations when you hit certain progression points or enter new areas, making it tricky if you miss her in one place and accidentally stumble into an entirely new region on your wanderi…",

Musk sees himself as an outsider and heroic figure taking on the status quo, despite being the world's richest man, the owner of X, and a sometimes-ally of Donald Trump. When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people. It's also an exploration of the ethics of transhumanism—an industry that Musk himself is extremely invested in. \"That kind of pol…",

This isn't a pair of headphones to wear on the bus or chat over Discord. They don't even have a microphone. No, the LCD-S20 is for sitting back and engrossing yourself in your favourite game or album and enjoying the tonal brilliance of planar magnetic drivers. Marketed at professional musicians and producers, the LCD-S20 are a little out of our usual comfort zone for PC gaming apparel. However, what makes them great for recording a track in a studio also has a benefit for PC gaming. Namely, planar magnetic drivers with SLAM technology and superb sound isolation. The LCD-S20 look a lot like the Audeze Maxwell . That's a pair of headphones that we rate very highly, with multiple members of the PCG hardware team using them as their daily driver, and I'll get back to comparisons with these later in the review. The LCD-S20 shares the same floating band design with three levels of adjustment, designed to keep all 550 grams of these mostly metal headphones off any one place on your head. It works pretty w…",

Bethesda had promised swish, rugged, canvas things in the promo; when they arrived on players' doorsteps, they were made of cheap, easily damaged nylon. This took an entire year to fix , somehow. Whether you remember it or not, Pete Hines—former senior vice president of global marketing and communications at Bethesda—certainly does. In a chat with Dbltap , Hines recalled the whole episode, which he says he only learnt about when his own collector's edition hit his doorstep, like an old army guy remembering a particularly harrowing battle. \"My first reaction was, 'When the fuck did we add a canvas bag to this collector's edition?' Because the version I approved did not have one,\" said Hines, who attributes the inclusion of the bags to Bethesda \"trying to add more value\" to the whizzbang expensive edition of the game. Per Hines, adding more value to anything was a tough task. \"We were always fighting with the finance people about margins, right?

The publisher has announced that MGS Delta: Snake Eater surpassed a million sales across all platforms (PC, PS5, and Xbox) on its launch day. MGS Delta: Snake Eater launched on August 28, though was available a couple of days earlier for those who shelled out for the digital deluxe edition. PCG's review concluded that \"Delta answers the question it most needed to answer: Can Konami still make a great Metal Gear game? By most metrics I think this has aced it.\" The sales might be impressive but the launch hasn't gone completely to plan, with the game suffering some significant performance issues, particularly with frame drops. Konami has acknowledged the issues and says it's \"currently investigating the causes and working on a patch to resolve these problems\", but as yet there's no ETA. (Image credit: Konami) Nevertheless this shows what we all surely knew anyway: Metal Gear is still big business, even without series impresario Hideo Kojima. Konami seems pretty happy with itself too, saying in a press release that \"this achievement reflect…",

In a chat about Silksong and the mad scramble of devs to escape the orbit of its release date , Lowrie mentioned that there is, of course, an upcoming release even bigger, more enormous, more Brobdingnagian than Hornet and her needle: GTA 6. \"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games,\" said Lowrie, \"and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game.\" That's quintuple-A, if they start blurring together at some point for you like they do for me. \"It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands.\" Silksong might have loomed over other indie games, but GTA 6 hangs over anything you could conceivably call a videogame.

How much of BG3's first act has been burned into your long-term memory? Try the 15 question quiz below to see how hopeless your RPG restarting habit is. Too easy? Too hard?

You can also explore the entire map instead of being stuck in the starting area. \"Venture across every zone in Hagga Basin to the Deep Desert to Harko Village and Arrakeen City,\" Funcom says. Perhaps most importantly, you can play with friends, too, by joining the server they play on—the first free weekend only let you play on servers with other players who were trying the game out, not people who had already bought it.

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

In its first 24 hours, Silksong's all-time peak player count is already the 18th highest in Steam history . And it'll likely rank higher before the day's out. As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players.
