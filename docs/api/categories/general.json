It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",

NexusMods user JngoCreates calls their creation \"Mucked Beastfly\" , and it's essentially the same flying bug we all hate combined with the nasty effects of an area we all hate too. Mucked Beastfly is what happens if you let the Savage Beastfly hang out in Bilewater, the maggot-infested swamp I would've preferred to never think about again. In the room where you normally fight Groal—an already notoriously hard boss—will be a vile version of the Savage Beastfly with new attacks that can infect Hornet, preventing her from being able to heal. Groal is nice enough to leave you a few sturdy platforms to safely land on during the fight. Not the Mucked Beastfly. There are platforms in the boss room but they sink into the pool of maggots after standing on them for a few seconds. JngoCreates also made sure to keep the Savage Beastfly's worst trait and…",

A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists. However, Recon players still favored Sniper Rifles over other weapons, and their pick rate was identical between both playlist types.\" That lines up with my experience.

According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.

Rather than, you know, do a proper cutscene, Nate and chill donkey-guy Moose will acknowledge the player's lack of interest in their narrative, sit down, drop character, and embark on a cutscene that puts even Kojima to shame. What proceeds is effectively a 28-minute podcast between Nate actor Gabe Cuzzillo and Moose actor Be…",

No matter how hard I try, it gets to a certain point where I just cannot go on anymore and turn back to my base. I can blame my depleting oxygen and inability to ever craft water breathing potions, but it's actually because it just feels long and unrewarding. Even when I know there's a shipwreck or temple, I will simply not go on the expedition. Minecraft's next drop, Mounts of Mayhem , provides a failsafe way to explore the ocean however, and I'm not sure I can get away with this anymore. Rather than having to rely on potions and your own ability to swim, the Nautilus will make the process of navigating the waves so much easier. These underwater mobs can be tamed with pufferfish before being saddled up and ridden by the player. Not only are they a decent escape option for any encounters with Drowned or Guardians thanks to their fast movement speed, they also completely bypass the fear of losing all your oxygen with the new \"Breath of the Nautilus\" effect.

For context: In the Borderlands 4 post-game, there's a vendor called Maurice's Black Market , a vending machine that changes location every week and sells a number of legendaries that are rolled on a per-player basis. However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds. It's a so-so system—it can be disappointing to rush to your own personal Maurice box, only to find out that none of the rolls are useful—but Pitchford does make a solid argument that this system lets communities band together to share their rolls and pick a buddy to skim good legendary weapons off.

New traits, utility skills and an overhaul of the base profession mechanic means entire new builds for players to try. \"We definitely figured out that we wanted to do elite specs pretty early,\" says Cal Cohen, senior game designer for Guild Wars 2, in an interview with PC Gamer. Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed. And usually elite specs can also fill a couple of different roles. So whenever we can do elite specs, I think we want to do elite specs.\" The new set of elite specs, which are launc…",

I've been a huge Paramore fan ever since I heard Pressure an embarrassing number of years ago. But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

My commute to work is about ten steps long and I can do it in slippers if I like. I don't have to take out a second mortgage if I want a coffee or a slice of cake. Best of all, I don't have to deal with *shudder* other people beyond the occasional email and phone call. That said, I'm aware that it's good to go outside once in a while. So I understand the motivation behind Rust 's latest update, which aims to shake up the meta to encourage players to stop loafing around in their houses and get back to the office—the office in this case being abandoned monuments to civilization where players can horribly murder one another. \"The current progression meta has grown stale, moving too fast and becoming too easy over the years,\" Facepunch writes in a Steam post , citing the abundance of the scrap resource as a cause. \"We don't believe this has been overwhelmingly negative, but it has detracted from world PvP, especially in and around monuments.\" To counter this, Facepunch is implementing a \"new layer of progression to the workbench system\".

Sure, it would have sold far fewer copies with such a title, but at least it would have been correct . Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

Though it came out of early access in 2020, Arctico has had some significant updates since then. There was a base-building update in June of this year, with a bunch of improvements, adjustments, and optimization to the base-building mechanics, and now there's been another update out of the blue , adding controller support and Steam Deck verification. The menus for building and accessing your inventory have all been revised to be more controller-friendly, text size tweaked for the Steam Deck version, in-game keyboards added, and the sled's input system \"adjusted to better support joystick input.\" Basically, it should play fine with your thumbs on the sticks rather than your hands on a mouse and keyboard.
