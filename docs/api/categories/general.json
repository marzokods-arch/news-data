    "body": "The first-week numbers for Taylor Swift ’s new album, The Life of a Showgirl , are, expectedly, massive. But even for an artist who has spent nearly two decades breaking her own records, these numbers are on another level entirely. Related How Has Taylor Swift Pulled So Far Away From the Rest of the Pop Pack With Her Commercial&nbsp;Performance? The Life of a Showgirl posts the biggest debut of the modern era (1991–present), shattering records for both single-week sales and equivalent album units (on the latest charts dated Oct. 18). Every single one of its 12 songs lands in the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100 — a feat no artist has ever achieved before. And with this latest sweep, Swift has now occupied the entire top 10 of the Hot 100 three separate times. No other artist in history has done it even once. Those accomplishments alone would be enough to define most careers, but for Swift, they’re just the beginning of another historic week. Across Billboard ’s album, song and genre charts, The Life of a Showgirl resets the record books — from streaming milestones to vinyl sales to chart longevity benchmarks. With the charts officially locked in, it’s worth looking closer at just h…",

While projects like LineageOS prioritize open-source code, some binary “blobs” have so far been necessary. The project will start by identifying a target handset with minimal proprietary code. Privacy is a big concern for a lot of smartphone users, and while platforms like Android offer oodles of different settings for managing your data and who gets access to it , at the end of the day you’re still placing your trust in Google. You’ve got other options, though, with projects like GrapheneOS offering alternative firmware that doubles down on privacy while further minimizing your data’s exposure. And now we’re learning about a new effort that looks to address one of the biggest issues with open software projects like that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

JOD is a lease plan that allowed subscribers to swap their leased devices out as frequently as once a month — an appealing proposition for folks who want to try out all the latest phones without spending thousands of dollars a year to do it. T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation. As spotted by The Mobile Report , T-Mobile is ending the JOD program on December 1. But as T-Mobile spells out in support documentation, existing JOD subscribers will get to keep their current device when the plan goes away. The carrier will even waive any remaining lease payments.",

The group would go on to massive success, and Martin, too. The Swedish songwriter and producer’s history includes an astounding 28 No. 1 hits as a writer on the Hot 100, a run that began in January 1999 with Britney Spears’ debut smash, “…Baby One More Time” (a title that would also prove prophetic). Among his other triumphs, he cowrote and coproduced the No. 1 hit on the Hot 100’s Greatest of All Time Songs retrospective, as announced in 2021: The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights.” When Martin first reached the Hot 100 as a writer, Taylor Swift was five years old. In 2012, their cowrite, also with Shellback, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” became her first leader on the list. By 2025, the trio landed its fifth No. 1 composition, Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia,” her 13th chart-topping song overall.

Ever.” It wasn’t supposed to be like this. In 2022, Daddy Yankee — that rare artist who has garnered both vast commercial success and respect from artists and the industry alike — surprised the world when he announced his retirement from music. He released what was supposed to be his last studio album, Legendaddy , and performed what was set to be his last tour, grossing $197.8 million and selling 1.9 million tickets, then the second-highest-grossing Latin tour in Billboard Boxscore history. But Ayala was spent. Then, on Dec. 3, 2023, at the tour’s final date at Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, he made yet another shocking revelation: “Tonight, I recognize, and I’m not ashamed to tell the whole world, that Jesus lives in me and I live for him,” he told the 15,000 fans that packed his hometown venue. “A story ends a…",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Picking out the best wall charger for the new Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is not the easiest task, thanks to some quite specific power requirements. Even then, I wasn’t too impressed when testing out Google’s new 67W plug — partly because of some aggressive power throttling to prevent the phone from overheating. This made me wonder if I could just stick with an older adapter and receive pretty much the same charging experience. The thing is, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s higher 39W power limit is locked behind a rarer 20V PPS charging protocol requirement, meaning most customers are looking at buying (another!) new plug.",

DJI is easily one of the top names to crop up when you’re looking for gimbals , and the brand is now rolling out an improved solution for phones. Less than a year after launching the Osmo Mobile 7 and 7P, DJI is introducing a successor with considerable improvements to panning and broader tracking support for apps that justify the update. The newly announced DJI Osmo Mobile 8 integrates or improves upon features from the more premium Osmo Mobile 7P . It now has the same compact profile as before, with an improved hand grip designed specifically for low-angle shots. With the updated model, DJI enhances panning, now supporting 360º rotation, which wasn’t previously possible.",

    "body": "TL;DR A future update for Google TV may let you program the customizable remote button to open a specific smart home camera feed directly. This would add a new shortcut option to the ‘star’ button, which can currently be set to launch an app, the input switcher, or the full smart home panel. Evidence for this unreleased feature was discovered in the code of the Google TV Ambient Mode app, though it’s not yet live. When you’re relaxing at home watching a show on your Google TV , interruptions are the last thing you want. Still, a package delivery or a strange sound outside can pull your attention away. That’s why the customizable button on select Google TV remotes is so useful, as it can be configured to open the smart home panel , letting you view a camera feed or control other devices. A future update, however, may take this a step further by letting you bypass the panel to launch your preferred camera feed directly. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

I know, I know, this is a Pixel, it’s supposed to have a good camera. But my past year with the Pixel 9 Pro XL left me with a sour taste in my mouth. The Pixel 9 underwhelmed me , repeatedly, with its camera performance. I’d see a beautiful, colorful scene, try to snap it, and get a boring, lifeless shot instead. While the Google Pixel 10 series fixes this , it has opened my eyes to how bad the Pixel 9 has been, so much so that I think what Google has done to that camera and its users is criminal.",

It will be available for $29.99 starting November 4. There’s a new must-have accessory for lazy (read: efficient) Kobo users. The company just announced its first-ever page turner, a simple, Bluetooth-powered clicker for readers who prefer to keep both hands buried under their blankets. Months ago, Kobo CEO Michael Tamblyn teased that a “little hardware surprise” was on the horizon, sparking speculation about what the company might be cooking up. Many Kobo fans guessed correctly that the use of “little” pointed toward a new accessory, with the leading theory being a remote page turner. Now that it’s official, Tamblyn describes the Kobo Remote as an invitation to “lounge deeper” and read longer. In short, the remote offers users more flexibility in reading position.",

Google is also expanding support for multiple similar cards through the same app. Google Wallet is much more than a payments app. It lets you neatly organize multiple different payments and membership cards, transit passes, event tickets, and much more. With a recent update , Google Wallet is gaining additional features to enhance your experience. For starters, Google is rolling out Nearby Pass geofence notifications in Wallet, first announced at Google I/O 2025 . This feature notifies users when they’re close to any location where one of their passes stored in Google Wallet could come in handy. For instance, these could be loyalty cards or vouchers for a retail store, a transit pass for the subway, the entry ticket to a concert, or something else.",

Honestly, I just wanted my favorite smartphone to provide the best possible camera experience, and I didn’t mind what it would take to achieve that. And then, Google introduced AI-powered 100x Pro Res Zoom on the Pixel 10 Pro lineup — and I still wasn’t happy. Instead, I decried the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL for leaning too heavily on AI processing. I complained that they wouldn’t treat photos of humans simply because Google wanted to avoid inaccuracies, but it had no problem using a little too much imagination while recreating signs, animals, and buildings. Overall, I dismissed the whole idea as nothing more than a gimmick meant to push AI forward.",

Tello is easily one of the very best prepaid options out there for those on a tight budget who don’t need truly unlimited data, but it’s typically not ideal for heavier users unless you keep most of your data consumption to Wi-Fi. Up until now, Tello’s $25 Unlimited plan has been capped at just 35GB of high-speed data, after which it essentially goes down to nearly unusable speeds that aren’t much better than dial-up. The good news is that Tello has officially changed its limit to 50GB, while keeping the same reasonably low price. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Motorola’s Razr lineup, and specifically the Razr Ultra, set a new standard for flip phone foldables. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the most exciting Samsung foldable we’ve seen in years, while the Flip 7 introduced long-overdue cover screen upgrades. And with its industry-first IP68 rating and built-in magnets, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold made a statement, too. When you consider that all of these phones were released in the United States, it makes you think that — finally — folding phones are not only becoming more mainstream in the country, but that the innovation for them hasn’t died either.",

It arrived with the stable One UI 8 Watch update, which, until yesterday, was limited to beta testers in Korea. Shortly after, however, Samsung also made the update available to a select set of users in the US, signalling the beginning of a broader release in the region. Two simultaneous reports indicate that the One UI 8 Watch update for the Galaxy Watch 7 is now live in the US. The first comes from Reddit user akaGustavo , who received the update on their 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 with LTE. A few others replied to the same thread, confirming the release. Meanwhile, Verizon has also officially confirmed the release for both the 40mm and 44mm variants of the Galaxy Watch 7.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google broke the Pixel IMS app that enabled VoLTE/VoWiFi on unsupported carriers, but the developer has already released a new workaround. Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

    "body": "TL;DR OPPO has unveiled a new Hasselblad-branded camera kit for the upcoming Find X9 Pro flagship. The kit includes a 9.6x zoom teleconverter lens, a magnetic case, a magnetic grip with a shutter button, and a shoulder strap. OPPO is also selling a MagSafe flash and fill light that synergizes with the magnetic case and grip. You can do a whole lot with the camera on your Android flagship , but there’s only so much you can do before you eventually reach the limits of hardware and physics. Phone makers have worked around this by experimenting with camera kits that attach to the phone, instantly giving your phone’s camera a level-up. The upcoming OPPO Find X9 series is one of the many Android flagships set to support a camera kit. Today, OPPO has officially unveiled the Hasselblad-branded kit, which users can purchase to enhance the camera capabilities of their upcoming Find X9 Pro. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The OnePlus 15’s display is officially confirmed to be brighter and features smaller bezels. OnePlus is also using a dedicated chip from OPPO to ensure fast performance of the 165Hz display. The OnePlus 15 is arriving soon as one of the earliest truly global smartphones with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. While its global launch is rumored to precede the OnePlus 13’s availability timeline, the phone will actually be released first in its home country, China, where the company has been dropping teasers for the phone one after another. One of the biggest upgrades on the OnePlus 15 is the new 165Hz display, which the brand has already confirmed. Its prowess and improvements to high-intensity gameplay have also been vouched for in a pre-launch gaming review . Now, OnePlus is revealing more details about the display in a series of Weibo posts. For starters, the display is again made by BOE, which has been supplying displays since the OnePlus 12.",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority I own half a dozen computers in various form factors and performance levels, but I recently found myself reaching for my Chromebook more often. Even with its admittedly lackluster performance and meagre 11-inch footprint, it has one killer feature I cannot live without: full-fledged Android app support. Having access to smartphone apps that have no real desktop equivalent is a game-changer, and I’m not just saying that because I write for Android Authority . Unfortunately, Microsoft sunset its Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) experiment earlier this year, which allowed you to run Android apps on Windows 11 . And while Phone Link does still exist, it only allows you to mirror your smartphone’s screen. Moreover, Microsoft still hasn’t enabled screen sharing support for Pixel and the vast majority of other smartphones. So if I want the best of Android on PC, I have to choose between a Chrome OS device or an emulator.",

I’ll wait for outcomes to unfold when I know I’m doing my best to achieve something, or when I sense life will throw something my way when the stars perfectly align. But in both those scenarios — and everything in between — nowhere does my patience extend to Google and its smart home efforts. Not anymore, at least, after having waited for years, not months. I got hopeful not too long ago when I saw leaked images of the now-official Google Home Speaker , but its announcement has turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent tech history. It may sound like a tall assertion, but the smart home category isn’t like buying a single gadget. It’s an ecosystem you consciously build — multiple pieces working together in a giant connected web. You can’t just toss out one piece and expect everything else to function the same way without friction or a learning curve, if at all.",

    "body": "TL;DR A Reddit user built a web tool called Kindlify.co, turning Kindles into Spotify remotes. The tool doesn’t play audio directly, but simply controls Spotify playback elsewhere. It’s a fun example of e-reader creativity, even if its uses are limited. E-readers aren’t exactly known for multimedia use, but one Reddit user had other plans. In a post titled “ Just turned my e-reader into a Spotify player ,” the user introduced Kindlify.co, a minimalist web interface that can turn your Kindle into a Spotify remote control. The concept is equal parts impressive and questionable. After all, Kindles were built for quiet reading sessions, not jams. Still, with a little ingenuity, this user managed to bring versatility into Amazon’s famously limited browser.",

The issue seems to be affecting the Pro Pixel 10 models more than others. Some users found a temporary workaround involving Google Play Services, but it may be a risky maneuver. Google rolled out the October Pixel update just last week, but it’s not going down smoothly for Pixel 10 owners. Users are reporting random app crashes after installing the update, with multiple threads on Reddit pointing to the Pixel 10 Pro as the most affected model. Since the update is still reaching more devices, it’s possible the issue extends to the standard Pixel 10 as well.",
