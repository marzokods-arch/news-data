    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority In early 2024, T-Mobile introduced a major shift in strategy with the launch of T-Life, a unified app designed to consolidate all of T-Mobile’s services under one roof. In the nearly two years since its release, we’ve seen the company fold in T-Mobile Tuesdays, T-Mobile Money, and even many in-store services, which now rely heavily on the app. It’s become almost impossible to interact with T-Mobile representatives without having a phone running a working copy of T-Life. At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",

As part of the settlement, Google committed to making major changes to the Android OS , the Play Store, and its communications and licensing agreements with developers and OEMs. One of the most significant changes involves introducing support for “Registered App Stores” in Android 17 .

And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.

All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging. This upgrade sounds great on paper, but it has left users of older Qi chargers scratching their heads in confusion and frustration, and I’m one of them.

These devices claim to offer impressive specs for under $200, but you should stay far away from them. It’s not uncommon to see cloned versions of popular smartphones, with Apple and Samsung frequently targeted by sketchy phone brands. The Galaxy S26 series isn’t even out yet, though, but we’ve already seen a few clones on the market. There are several listings on Amazon for Galaxy S26 Ultra clones, starting with the $170 S26 Ultra (also called the C26 Ultra). The listing promises features such as a 7.3-inch HD screen, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 6,800mAh battery, a “108MP+72MP” camera, a stylus with an integrated stylus slot, and a microSD card slot. If the microSD support is indeed confirmed, that means this Galaxy S26 Ultra clone has a feature that the real S26 Ultra likely won’t have.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR • Samsung originally planned a slimmer Galaxy S26 with a larger battery but reversed course due to Apple’s decision to maintain a $799 price tag for the iPhone 17. Samsung’s revised plan appears to retain the previous dimensions of the S26, with a smaller increase in battery capacity, while focusing on maintaining competitive pricing. Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup. A new report now sheds light on the reason behind some of these changes, and the answer is surprisingly simple: Apple. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google rolled out the November Pixel update earlier this week, right alongside the latest Pixel Drop . The update brought new improvements and bug fixes to the Pixel 7a and above. Naturally, users quickly noticed that the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro were missing from the list of devices receiving Google’s monthly bug-fix update. Folks also speculated that Google is dropping monthly updates for the phones in favor of quarterly patches.

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR ARMSX2, a new, modern PS2 emulator, is now available on the Play Store. The app launched a few weeks ago, but Play Store approval took a few extra weeks. It’s still early in development, and performance may be worse than AetherSX2/NetherSX2. PlayStation 2 emulation on Android has lagged behind its PC counterpart for years, but a new project is here to change that. Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

But OnePlus, backed by the earlier-than-usual release of the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 , is already launching a successor: the OnePlus 15. Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship. As it finds a spot among other flagships, it’s worth evaluating how the OnePlus 15 competes against its competitors in the premium segment.",

This time, though, instead of creating a jack of all trades (which, to be fair, was a master of most of them), OnePlus is after power users — or at least, I think it is. The reason I say I think rather than I know is that despite testing this phone for a few weeks, I’m not quite sure how we got to this point. I know the OnePlus 15 is powerful on paper — it boasts the latest chipset, a large battery, ample RAM, and sufficient storage to prove it. But for everything that has improved, it feels like just as much has taken a step backward from a predecessor that is still one of the best Android phones you can buy .
