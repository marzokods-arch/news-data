And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck. Let me tell you, spamming an upgrade button to see if you got the right result is not particularly fun, especially when you're doing it for every piece of gear you own. It's even worse when it's …",

I've been on multiple trains in the past year and I've only rarely had to open fire on anyone. So I was sceptical leading up to my hands-on time with Red Rover Interactive's Enginefall, which is in essence a Dune: Awakening-ish take on Snowpiercer . I might still be a little sceptical, but I see the vision now. Romping about the game's carriages with ad-hoc armaments, getting the drop on other players, and seeing the ruined world zip by out the window: it works better than it maybe should, and provides ample space for you and other players to gin up temporary, make-do alliances that you betray the nanosecond it becomes profitable. (Image credit: Red Rover) Good stuff, but there are caveats. First up, I was playing Enginefall under pretty much ideal conditions: alongside devs and media types…",

That's a teensy exaggeration, of course, but with a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, this is certainly one of the very punchiest gaming panels we've yet seen. It's intriguing for one or two other reasons, too. But let's start with that eye-popping 1,600 brightness rating. This is a mini LED monitor, not an OLED panel and it comes with a VESA DisplayHDR 1400 rating. That means it must be capable of hitting 1,400 nits, full screen. By contrast, pun intended, the brightest OLED monitors are currently rated at 1,300 nits, like the LG Ultragear 45GX950A , but can only achieve that in tiny windows measuring a percentage or two of the whole screen. In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time.

Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday. Steam is only part of the PC playerbase picture—a lot of Call of Duty players migrated to the Xbox app with Black Ops 6, where numbers are hidden—but the difference is star…",

Using a glitch found by a member of the Silksong speedrunning Discord, YouTuber Kilroy Was Here figured out a reliable method for trivializing one of the toughest fights in the second act. It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",

NexusMods user JngoCreates calls their creation \"Mucked Beastfly\" , and it's essentially the same flying bug we all hate combined with the nasty effects of an area we all hate too. Mucked Beastfly is what happens if you let the Savage Beastfly hang out in Bilewater, the maggot-infested swamp I would've preferred to never think about again. In the room where you normally fight Groal—an already notoriously hard boss—will be a vile version of the Savage Beastfly with new attacks that can infect Hornet, preventing her from being able to heal. Groal is nice enough to leave you a few sturdy platforms to safely land on during the fight. Not the Mucked Beastfly. There are platforms in the boss room but they sink into the pool of maggots after standing on them for a few seconds. JngoCreates also made sure to keep the Savage Beastfly's worst trait and…",

A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists. However, Recon players still favored Sniper Rifles over other weapons, and their pick rate was identical between both playlist types.\" That lines up with my experience.

According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.
