    "body": "John Williamson , the Australian “bush music” legend, has criticized a nationwide anti-immigration protest where his signature song, “True Blue,” was reportedly played without his approval. Thousands gathered in several Australian capital cities last Sunday, Oct. 19 for the “March for Australia” rallies, which formed as a collective voice against the federal government’s immigration policies, and for counter protests. Williamson, not for the first time, has called out the unauthorized use of his music. Turning to Facebook , Williamson writes: “‘True Blue’ is a song for all Australians and should not be hijacked by any group that seeks to use the song to sow division. I believe in a multicultural society &#8211; one where all Australians come together in unity to celebrate our unique multicultural nature and freedoms.” A decade ago, the ARIA Hall of Famer put conservative event organizers on blast for attempting to weaponize his famous song. Back in 2015, he shared a post on Facebook in which he noted that “True Blue” was reportedly being used at rallies by various groups including the Reclaim Australia movement, and “did not have my approval to use it.” On that occasion, he wrote,…",

Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way.",

At the cost of some battery life, your phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance. While most Android phones have an AOD, it doesn’t behave the same way on every device. Some phones let you schedule the AOD to benefit from its glanceable information without unnecessarily draining the battery. Pixel phones , however, offer no such controls — the AOD is either on or off during the day.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is working on adding a new incognito search mode to its Android app. The feature will work by turning off the history for your current search. This is the equivalent of Google’s incognito mode on its iOS app. There are many ways to perform an incognito search on your Android phone, but Google is working on adding another one that is both more intuitive and easier to remember. The option might have the less obvious name of “History Off Search” instead of a simpler “Incognito” and will appear straight in the main Google app. This will finally allow the Google app on Android to catch up to the iOS app, which has had an incognito mode for many years.

The rest of the camera system consists of a 50MP main camera (1/1.56-inch), a 50MP ultrawide shooter, and a 32MP selfie camera. In a neat touch, you can swap out the rear camera housings.

The app’s also working on a couple more Expressive updates, including a new loading indicator. Card UI may also be updated to move text away from graphics. Material 3 Expressive finally landed in full force last month, and based on your feedback, the changes it implements are well appreciated. But as we’ve seen this past summer, Expressive revamps to existing Android apps haven’t been hitting all at once, and Google continues to whittle away at them. Right now we’ve spotted some new tweaks to one of the company’s apps, and some hints at what could be changing next.

Colorsoft screens still suit comics and PDFs, but trade sharpness for color. Update: October 20, 2025 (12:25 PM ET): Following the publication of the original article below, Amazon contacted us to highlight an amendment to the FAQ section on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. In response to the question “How is the reading experience different on Kindle Colorsoft than on Kindle Paperwhite?” the answer now reads “The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display, and includes a fully optimized display stack to deliver high quality color reading. The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard.

It’s been around on Apple devices for a few years now, allowing you to team up with friends or family to watch something together, syncing video streams over a video call. It’s a handy tool when your loved ones aren’t in the same location. As with everything Apple, you can’t use it outside of the walled garden, so Android users are left out. To counter that, Google made its own version of SharePlay (I don’t blame you if you’ve never heard of it), but it leaves you wanting more — much more. After a moment of using it, I thought, “That’s it? That’s all it does?”",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",
