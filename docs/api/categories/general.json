You don't really think about it when you've only got the valley to explore, as each of the biomes feel so close you don't need to make a massive journey to get where you need to go. However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that. Fortunately, the newest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, has unleashed what I can only describe as the best method of transport for a game like this: horses. That's right, if you're someone who grew up wanting to be a princess and asking for a pony every Christmas, then Disney Dreamlight Valley has finally answered your wishes. Within the Wishblossom Ranch DLC you'll be able to befriend numerous horses too, rather than just being lumped with one. You'll have wild horses to customise and befriend, but most notably, three iconic Disney horses have been added: Maximus from Tangled, Khan from Mulan, and Pegasus fr…",

Our council is no less impressive, with members such as Tanya Short, Martin Wahlund, Dave Oshry, Terry Crews, Caroline Marchal, and Devora Wilde all casting their opinions. Hosted by regular host and esports legend Frankie Ward, PC Gamer's own Midas, and with the vocal talents of Baldur's Gate 3 and Hades 2's Amelia Tyler, it's promising to be a good show.

When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

    "summary": "The other investors have tiny stakes, and the PIF has stakes in them.",
    "body": "When EA announced in October that it will go private via a $55 billion leveraged buyout, a consortium of three investment firms were listed as buyers: Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and Silver Lake. A breakdown of the ownership between these parties wasn't given at the time, but as it turns out, one is committing significantly more cash than the others. According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA.

The Forsaken Hollows has more in it than FromSoft originally let on. Sure, you can play the new supportive scholar character or the aggressive nun with the hammer, but there's also new locations coming to the original Limveld map and a new shifting earth event that brings you to what is effectively an entirely separate landmass.

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae.

According to SEDaily (via Wccftech ), Samsung's Semiconductor Division (DS) won't give its Mobile Experience (MX) division—its smartphone division—a 12-month supply of DRAM. The latter will instead have to request DRAM quarterly. Y'know, because prices might rise quick enough for quarterly renegotiations to make sense. Yep, those would be Samsung v Samsung negotiations. Apparently, this \"comes as Samsung Semiconductor is restructuring its production lines to focus on high-margin products such as high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence accelerators and low-power DRAM for mobile devices, in an effort to maximize profitability.\" (Image credit: Samsung) It's surely the former that's the real impetus to restructure here, though. The Smartphone market is hardly exploding in new profitability . The AI industry, on the other hand… well, even the most cursory glance at the news over the past few months will have see…",

One other key takeaway is that OLED burn-in happens fastest in the first six months, after which further degradation seems to be more gradual. As before, this test is described as a worst-case scenario for OLED use and based on the MSI MPG 321URX QD-OLED , a 32-inch 4K model. That means Monitors Unboxed isn't using it for gaming but the daily computing grind with lots of static content for eight hours a day. The channel also only runs MSI's OLED panel compensation cycle at the end of the eight hour working day, not at the four-hour intervals that MSI recommends. The idea, in other words, isn't to baby this monitor but use it just as you would an LCD panel. And you don't have to break off from work in the middle of the day for 10 minutes to run compensation cycles on LCD monitors. In total, Monitors Unboxed has been running this monitor for about 60 hours a week or 250 hours per month for the past 21 months and thus has clocked up over 5,000 hours of largely static use.

The good times got me thinking about a PC gaming maxim that says an FPS is always better with mouse and keyboard. I was diehard about this for a long time—plenty of shooters feel fine on a controller, but I couldn't imagine a scenario where the precision of a mouse isn't a demonstrably better experience than thumbsticks.

    "body": "The hunger for a hot new life sim in the Sims-like style is still going strong and everything we know about Paralives suggests it's going to be a worthwhile new contender next to The Sims series and Inzoi. It's being made by a much smaller team than either EA or Krafton, but is still planning to include features that have been long asked-for among Sims fans. Paralives has been in development for quite a few years at this point, and it will initially launch into early access while continuing to work on expanding the possibilities of its Live Mode simulation. While we wait for launch day, here's what you should know about Paralives and how it stacks up against the current life sim crop. Paralives release date (Image credit: Paralives Studio) When is the Paralives release date? It's a long time coming but the Paralives release date is May 25, 2026 for PC and Mac on Steam . It was previously scheduled to launch into early access on December 8, 2025 but was delayed into the next year about a month beforehand. \"Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode,\" said Paralives Studio in its delay announcement . \"However, there are still impactful bugs i…",

    "body": "I love Fallout: New Vegas but you know what I don't love? New Vegas itself. The strip and the casinos are a bit of a letdown. The streets are nearly empty. The casinos are dull. And the biggest crime of all: you can't play poker. For the past 15 years, our choices of casino games in New Vegas have been limited to slot machines, blackjack, and roulette. But finally, finally , one heroic modder has added video poker. And New Vegas, at last, feels more like Present Vegas as a result. The mod by W00Z, called wGames - Introducing Video Poker , adds a classic of the video poker genre: Jacks or Better. Belly up to the machine, place a bet, and you'll be dealt five cards. Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps. With the mod installed these new video poker terminals can be found in The Tops, Gomorrah, the Atomic Wrangler, and all other New Vegas casinos, with a lovely detail that the card backs on each machine will vary depending on which joint you're gambling in.

    "body": "The departure of Hideo Kojima from Konami saw the publisher react, initially at least, like a spurned lover. There was an ill-advised attempt to remove the creator's name from certain packaging, followed-up by the even more ill-advised spinoff Metal Gear Survive, before things went quiet and, for years and years, Konami did nothing with the company's flagship series. Time heals all wounds though, and in recent years Konami has been doing a good job of gradually bringing Metal Gear back: first with the Master Collection Volume 1, which brought the first two Metal Gear MSX titles and three Metal Gear Solid games (plus spinoffs) to modern platforms. It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone . It may not be the glorious future this series deserves, but it showed that Konami could still kick it at the top table, and produce a Metal Gear game that looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. Konami's staying tight-lipped about what's next, though we do know that The Master Collection Volume 2 is i…",

    "body": "An unlucky former Rockstar animator has made themselves the new temporary focus of Grand Theft Auto fans, after posting a demo reel of their work on various company titles to Vimeo. The two-minute reel includes finished scenes from the likes of GTA5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, alongside various one-off animations with Pixar-style cartoon characters, but it's the opening 20 seconds that's attracting all the attention. The three animations are flat-textured and set to Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road, the song featured in GTA 6's first trailer. The first shows a male character removing what seems to be the GTA 6 version of a Lime Bike from the rental rack, and then returning the bike to the same spot. Eagle-eyed fans had previously identified bike racks for some sort of rental company (which may well be called \"Lombike\"), so clearly this is another aspect of modern urban life that has found its way into the game. The other two animations show a character, which does resemble protagonist Lucia, clambering down from a truck bed first of all, before the second animation shows her hopping down from the truck roof to the truck bed, and then out to the ground. There are also a few buildings…",
