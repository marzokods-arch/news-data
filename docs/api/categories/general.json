Unfortunately absence has not made the heart grow fonder, and it's currently sitting at Mixed reviews on Steam . The consensus among the user reviews, even the positive ones, is that Bloodlines 2 doesn't really earn the name, and that it has a surprising dearth of RPG systems for something that calls itself an RPG. \"It is a good VtM game, but it is not a Bloodlines game,\" one positive review reads. \"Paradox could have saved them a ton of outrage by marketing it differently.\" But they're not all so balanced. \"Nothing about this game is what you sold us 6 years [ago],\" reads a less favourable review, \"and you don't deserve to be let off the hook for that.\" I'm not remotely surprised by the response so far. I had a good time skulking through the streets of blizzard-battered Seattle, giving it a respectable 78 in my Bloodlines 2 review , but the most common criticisms are the same ones I had. It's a narrative-driven mystery, an investigative adventure game, masquerading as an RPG with only the thinnest RPG systems. And it p…",

And then apparently recommending potentially dangerous 'fixes' that, er, don't even work. At least, that seems to be the case with Cooler Master's support recommendation to a customer who connected support about a power connector that wouldn't fit their GPU. This is relayed by Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab who, true to form, has thoroughly tested the power cable and the proposed fix. The problem the customer relayed was that the angled connector that came included with a certain Cooler Master power supply was angled so it was hitting the cooler when attempting to plug it into an Asus RTX 5070 Ti OC. Cooler Master's suggested fix was to adjust the angle of the cable by using \"a small pick or flat screwdriver to release the clips from both sides of the cap.\" If your initial reaction to this suggestion isn't to pull a cartoonish O-face, then maybe you've forgotten about the fact that these 12V-2x6 cables seem to be prone to melting , at least with higher-end graphics cards.

Don't misunderstand, everything our Jacob loved in his wired Scuf Valor Pro review is here too—just at a much higher price point. Whereas the wired version of this controller will set you back $100 , this wireless update is asking just shy of $190 . Offering 'Tri-mode connectivity' for your PC, Xbox, and Bluetooth devices, it's not just the wireless functionality pushing the price uncomfortably close to 200 big ones, but new asymmetric TMR thumbsticks too. Utilising magnetism like the Hall effect, TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) also offers the same longevity and effective banishment of stick drift. However, TMR is far more sensitive than the Hall effect, with the electromagnetic sensors able to pick up far slighter stick movements for an even greater level of precision—so, that's what you're paying a premium for. However, unless you're a pi…",

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Have you seen this Battlefield 6 map? It's called Saints Quarter, and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting (or only now realizing) it exists. Until yesterday, I'd only played on it by accident. Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. (If you also forgot Battlefield 6 had those modes, you're forgiven twice.) I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit. It's not my favorite Battlefield 6 map, but it might be its most successful. In essence, Saints Quarters represents Battlefield Studios' best stab at the Call of Duty experience. It's designed top-to-bottom…",

I'm not talking about Her Story, or The Bunker, or Late Shift: the most recent wave is coming pretty much entirely from Asia, spanning China, Japan, Korea and Singapore. There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go. It's published by 4Divinity for one—a Singapore-based publisher with a growing profile in Asia.

When I'm expected to run and jump sidescroll-ways, my brain responds like a cornered animal. My hands can't be trusted, and nobody is safe—least of all me. Today, that's begun to change thanks to This Is No Cave. It's a minimalist sci-fi platformer, where you play as a charming little yellow-suited astronaut attempting to escape their crash landing on an alien planet by using their boot thrusters and grappling hook to fling their tumbling body through a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels. (Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",

I spent ages searching for the option too, but there is no manual save in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. The system is a tad barebones and what you see from the beginning is what you get. Unless you're willing to repeat quests completely, the vampire RPG makes you dig Phyre's grave, then lie in it. How do you save in Bloodliness 2? The only way to save in Bloodlines 2 is its auto-save system which keeps your progress through vampire-infested Seattle.

At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports.

After all, there's only so much you can say about a lovely-but-standard rig with the usual lashings of RGB, and perhaps a figurine or two to make it stand out. This, though. This one demands comment. Redditor The87Player has built something truly unique, a gaming PC with aged components crammed inside what looks to be a large plastic water jug, with six RGB-emblazoned fans socketed into the front. With one solitary exhaust fan at the rear and no visible ventilation anywhere else, I'd like to note. Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130. That's around $150, for those of you that only speak in God's own currency. Anyway, it's got a decade-old Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 CPU at its heart, in combination with a luxurious 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (that feels weird to type at this point) and a GTX 960 trucking away in the GPU slot. So, what sort of performance can we expect from this juggernaut (sorry) of PC gaming greatness? A whole 15 fps in Fortnite at High setting…",

According to Caleb in a video posted today , the story increasingly goes that OLED is running out of time and will soon be replaced by RGB mini-LED technology. In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money. At the same time, there's the OLED brightness thing, with full-panel brightness remaining a fraction of that achieved by LCD TV with LED backlights. Oh, and the whole burn-in fiasco. Enter RGB mini-LED tech, which is being pitched as the next big thing. Bigger, brighter and plain just better than OLED. And exit OLED, right? As Caleb points …",

At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has.

Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time. The real moral of the story here is to not just trust any old listing saying they've got the genuine ar…",

The US-based fabrication plant (fab) started churning out wafers last year, and it has now produced the first-ever US-made Nvidia Blackwell wafer . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"This is a historic moment for several reasons. It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States.\" And although Huang would, of course, say this about Nvidia's own chip, it is probably true that Blackwell is the \"single most important chip.\" That's because it's far and away the chip that AI datacentre companies are clawing for. TSMC Arizona CEO Ray Chuang expressed the importance of the recent Blackwell chip: \"To go from arriving in Arizona to delivering the first U.S.-made NVIDIA Blackwell chip in just a few short years represents the very best of TSMC.\" None of this is to say that the Arizona plant's…",

    "body": "I have come to commend what I can only describe as 8BitDo's commitment to the bit. From the 8BitDo Retro keyboard and the Pro 3 gamepad, to the R8 gaming mouse sat under my palm, they all have a distinguished and unique look, but they're so much more than a retro facade slapped on top of any old peripheral. Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons …",

It's a platformer focused on fluid, momentum-based motion through stylish one-screen levels, and I can't recommend it enough: nothing else feels like this game. In my 92/100 review I practiced no restraint at all. \"In some ways N++ feels like the end of the action platformer,\" I wrote, \"like an exhaustive final document, a catalogue of its emotional highs and lows.\" I stand by those words mostly because, ten years later, I still play N++ occasionally. There's nothing else that scratches the same itch. And with over 4,000 levels—not including user-made levels—It's so big that I doubt I'll ever finish it. But that doesn't mean I'm not excited for Ten++, which is a sizeable new update adding even more levels I doubt I'll ever finish. The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\". And for the masochists among us, good news: \"some of these levels are so challenging that it'll take you ten more years to beat them,\" writes Metanet in its Steam announcement post .
