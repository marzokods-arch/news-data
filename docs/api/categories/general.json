However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Stevie Nicks&rsquo; Bella Donna Barbie doll sold out in under 24 hours upon its release, and the story was the same for her last Mattel collaboration. If you missed it, in celebration of the star&rsquo;s Bella Donna album&rsquo;s 43rd anniversary, Nicks collaborated with Mattel to create a Barbie doll inspired by the solo project. The latest doll pays tribute to Nicks&rsquo; iconic Bella Donna album, released in 1981, marking the star&rsquo;s first solo project. The doll quickly sold out overnight on all platforms including Walmart, Amazon, Target, Mattel Shop and Mattel Creations. Lucky for you however, the doll is back in stock at Walmart , currently retailing for $114 . The doll is dressed in an extremely detailed replica of the gown seen on the cover of Nicks&rsquo; first solo album , capturing the ethereal style and timeless spirit of the garment and the singer wearing it.

According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, he comes even closer on September’s report, logging a second consecutive month at No. 1 with $98.1 million and 580,000 tickets sold. When Brown topped the charts last month , he became the 10th artist to report monthly earnings of more than $90 million since the lists launched in 2019. By immediately hitting that mark again, he becomes just the third act to do so twice. Beyoncé grossed more than $90 million in six different months, split evenly between 2023’s Renaissance World Tour and this year’s Cowboy Carter Tour. Bad Bunny did it twice, both during 2022’s World’s Hottest Tour. Brown’s 13 shows during September were spread across 10 U.S. cities, three of which boasted double-headers. Those – Arlington, Texas (Globe Life Park on Sept. 2-3), Inglewood, Calif. (SoFi Stadium on Sept. 13-14), and Las Vegas (Allegiant Stadium on Sept. 19-20) – broke $10 million each, grossing $14 million, $16.3 million, and $15.8 million, respectively.

We’d known in advance, of course, and I really wanted to tell everyone. Finally saying it out loud felt like a huge weight off my shoulders. At the same time, I was worried — would LUNÉ like the news as much as we hoped? Hearing the cheers grow louder right in front of us, I felt relieved and reassured. What are you most looking forward to as the album Back to Life arrives on Oct. 28?
