The August-released set debuted at No. 4 on Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart and at No. 14 on the all-genre Billboard 200 . Adcock also earned a string of RIAA gold and platinum-certified songs this year. But beyond music accolades, the Warner Music Nashville-signed Adcock has been in plenty of headlines, for reasons outside of music. He was arrested in May in Wilson County, Tennessee, on charges including reckless driving and an open container violation (he was released and the charges were later dismissed ). He played off the arrest by later releasing the song &#8220;Morning Bail.&#8221; But he also has a penchant for seemingly beefing with several people, from fellow artists to a concert sound technician. Adcock has stirred up controversy for expressing his views on Beyoncé&#8217;s Cowboy Carter album, calling out Zach Bryan in an incident involving a fan autograph, and engaging in an ongoing back-and-forth beef with country/Americana artist Charley Crockett.
