    "body": "It's not enough to slay thousands of monsters simply for the fun of it. What if all that bloodshed was to show off how much better you are at it than the rest of them? After years of asking for it, Diablo 4 players are finally getting leaderboards—and a new mode to go with them—in its next update. Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta. Leaderboards have been an important part of action RPGs since Diablo 2. In a genre about becoming a demon-slaying god, it can be fun to see how …",

Today, I sat down for the first time in 2026, only to see that the memory supply crisis is well and truly having a knock-on effect on SSD pricing. Our Jeremy has already been keeping an eye on surging PC hardware prices , but this morning presented a more recent example. I just wrote a deal post about the 1 TB version of the Lexar NM790 NVMe SSD which, today, is going for $118. Not terrible, right? Well, that's what I thought until I remembered I had in fact written about the same SSD back in October of last year—when it was only $66. That is a close to 50% price increase in about four months. Even worse, this same drive cost almost $150 within the last month according to Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel . The Lexar is far from the most egregious increase I've seen, with higher capacity SSDs more severely affected. For one extreme example, Best Buy is currently asking for over a grand for the 4 TB version of the WD_Black SN850X SSD. It's hard to rule this out as simply a listing error when Newegg is asking for $520 for the same drive . If we look back at my Am…",

I'm happy to hear that future Intel laptops could have good gaming chops without a dedicated GPU, but it's not just the gaming performance that has wowed me thus far. It's something much more mundane: multi-day laptop battery life. AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, recently took a swing at Panther Lake , and part of the argumentation is that consumers buy chips based on needs, rather than going for a little bit of everything. In this, Tikoo argues that AMD offers the top of the line for gaming, and therefore, gamers will pick AMD. However, as someone who games a lot, I don't actually look for the absolute best gaming performance out of my laptop. I look for 'good enough' gaming, plus solid ergonomics, a decent weight, and most importantly, strong battery life.

Comment from r/Games For the uninitiated, Divinity: Original Sin 2 split protection into two categories: physical and magical. The problem is that these were effectively two different additional health bars for enemies, weakened by two entirely separate types of damage, and you'd need to break at least one. What this meant is that you were generally much better off having your party focus on either physical or magical damage to break your chosen type faster, rather than using a mixed party and splitting damage between the two types.

For its part, Warhorse is rather tired of talking about it. The studio told us last year that it was \"fed up\" of being dragged into culture wars and wanted only \"to make a cool videogame,\" but when I got the chance to chat with Martin Klíma, studio co-founder and KCD2 executive producer, about KCD2 taking PCG's 2025 GOTY award , I had to take a second to ask: did he think the controversies actually impacted the series at all, in terms of sales, reception, or developer morale? Klíma said that, really, it was difficult to tell. \"I would really, really like to know the answer to this one,\" he said. \"You can really convincingly argue both ways.

As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games.

I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows.

    "body": "Phasmophobia was an instant classic when it launched back in 2020, and it continues to be one of the top games on Steam to this day, having surpassed over 25 million copies sold in early access. It even spawned a wave of similarly successful hits like REPO and Lethal Company , playing its part in birthing the questionably-named friendslop genre (it's a co-op horror game, really). It's safe to say that this success came as a surprise to the at-the-time solo developer Daniel Knight. Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

    "body": "Fantasy megasim and mad magnum opus Dwarf Fortress has a long and cherished history of absurd patch notes and bug reports, having gifted us with bangers like \"Made the corpses of small animals that die out of water stop teleporting\" and \"Bug: Ghost of vampires still drink blood.\" With its first patch of 2026, Dwarf Fortress is already hitting the ground running in what's likely to be another year of unhinged update literature. However, while DF's patch notes often skew towards absurdist comedy, update 53.09 features a bugfix that's raw tragedy: \"Mothers no longer seek ghostly babies.\" Sorry, baby shoes. We found a sadder six-word story. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) For the uninitiated, properly attending to your settlement's dead is one of the many obligations the Dwarf Fortress player has to manage. When a dwarf succumbs to one of DF's countless hazards, you don't just suffer the loss of a worker and the emotional toll that's dealt to their grieving loved ones. If a dead dwarf isn't adequately entombed or memorialized, there's a chance that their restless spirit will return to haunt the fortress, further tormenting those who've outlasted them. And if your fortress has suffered a …",

    "body": "Fallout has a lot of iconic hallmarks—ghouls, deathclaws, radioactive cesspools, and some swingin' music. But it's also iconic for the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS), which sees you using your Pip Boy to target and pop-pop body parts of various wasteland uglies. While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?'\" To hear Pely describe it, it was a right pain in the butt to get it all sorted—even camera positioning was a big challenge: \"We spent so much time basically trying to get the game to figure out where to put the camera so you could see the slow-motion playback. There had to be an algorithm to make sure it didn'…",

Some models have risen but no matter what your budget is, there's a decent value option to be found.
