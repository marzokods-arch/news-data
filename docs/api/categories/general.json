OnePlus says US accounts are moving to a new platform, with “historical contributions” set to be preserved. Support staff also indicated OHealth and OnePlus account services should not be affected. If you own a OnePlus Watch or OnePlus earbuds, you might have seen a confusing email recently. It came from HeyTap, the Oppo-linked company that develops and supports the OHealth and HeyMelody apps. The email said US account services are shutting down on September 28. That naturally raised a few eyebrows. These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next? Some Watch owners on Reddit worried they’d be cut off from their health metrics. Others assumed there would be a plan, and this would have little impact on the apps themselves.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch.

    "body": "I’ve used a lot of Nexus and Pixels in the past, but from 2019 until present, I’ve been a Samsung guy, owning the S10 Plus and every Ultra model from the S20 to the S24 series. A few months ago, I started thinking about switching to a Pixel for the first time since the Pixel 3 XL. After the Pixel 10 launched, I pulled the trigger and bought a 10 Pro . After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place. Toggling all of the alarms in a group with the press of a single button saves time and is so much easier than having to scroll through a list of alarms to find the right ones.",

But there’s one minor change that’s probably gone under the radar, and that has made my personal Photos experience so much better. I’m talking about the improved functionality when adding photos to albums. I used to scroll for seconds if not minutes on end, trying to find the album that I wanted to add a photo to, but now, it’s all simpler and faster. It’s perfect for someone like me with a large photo library and dozens upon dozens of albums.",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how the industry is shifting and whether an online-only future may be on the horizon.",

The alert claims the selected title is not valid for Digital purchase on the Kindle, even when the book was loaded via USB or email rather than bought through Amazon’s storefront. Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected. Oddly enough, if you navigate by tapping the three dots, then Go to, then select a chapter, you can crack open affected books.

The Galaxy Buds 4 carry the model number SM-R540, while the model number for the Buds 4 Pro is SM-R640. For comparison, the model numbers for Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are SM-R530 and SM-R630, respectively. It’s been over a year since Samsung launched the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. As such, you may be wondering what exactly is going on with Samsung’s next premium wireless earbuds . Rumors have been pointing to a release in early 2026, possibly launching during the first Galaxy Unpacked of the year. Outside of a few other details, there isn’t a whole lot of information to parse through yet. However, we are learning something new today about the next-generation earbuds — the model numbers. Although stable One UI 8 is just starting to arrive on Galaxy devices, Samsung is already working on One UI 8.5. That update appears to have leaked , as some people are digging into an alleged modified build. In a tip sent to Android Authority , the code within that build seems to provide the very first reference to the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro .",

Google TV hasn’t been having the best luck in the crowded smart TV market recently. With relatively low adoption in the US and advertisers favoring YouTube instead, Google seems to be rethinking parts of the TV platform, starting with a potential refresh of the home screen design. As spotted by 9to5Google , the update is showing up through an apparent server-side change on top of Google TV Home version 1.0.806977084. Navigation is split into two pill-shaped clusters that sit above the content feed. One holds “Home,” “Live,” and “Apps” alongside a search shortcut, while the other contains quick-access buttons for settings and the screensaver. A built-in tooltip even explains the switch, noting that “For You” has been renamed “Home” and that search now lives in this section.",
