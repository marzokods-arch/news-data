Home to 17 songs produced by Xross, including the previously released singles “Corazón Vacío,” “Ramen Para Dos” with Paulo Londra, and “JOJO,” Quimera represents the &#8220;rollercoaster of emotions” that the Argentine experienced during her hospitalization and recuperation. Inspired by the mythical creature, chimera, it also inspired four alter egos, each with a set of songs that best characterize them: Shanina, Gladys, Jojo, and Maite.&nbsp; “The concept started in April, but I had just gone through a very difficult health situation, a huge loss,” she tells Billboard in an exclusive interview. “I was in a very hopeless, sad, and empty emotional state…when you don&#8217;t understand that something inside you isn&#8217;t working.

The dock hides a detachable FlexiOne deep cleaner, essentially a portable spot-cleaning unit you can grab for carpets, stairs, and fabric messes the robot can’t reach.

Customers who do not have the perk but still bill Apple TV through T-Mobile will start paying $12.99 per month. The carrier has begun texting impacted customers about the change. In what’s become the norm for streaming services these days, Apple TV increased its prices from $9.99 per month to $12.99 per month in August. As it turns out, it seems carriers hate paying higher prices just as much as you do. T-Mobile has long offered Apple TV as a free “On Us” perk on most of its Plus and above plans, but that will come to an end soon. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

If you live outside of the US, you can choose 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz for your connection speed. However, those of us who do live in the US are stuck with 2.4GHz and 5GHz.

    "body": "TL;DR The Abxylute 3D One is a new gaming handheld with an 11-inch glasses-free 3D screen. It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

    "body": "Credit: AssembleDebug / Android Authority TL;DR The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro will likely feature a new “Find Your Phone” function, which can be triggered by pressing a button on the charging case. “Find Your Phone” will differ from “Find My Earbuds” by helping users locate their phone, rather than their earbuds. The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans. We’ve now spotted one more new feature coming to the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, which could allow users to easily locate their phone with the click of a button.
