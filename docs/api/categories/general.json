    "body": "Disney Dreamlight Valley's Wishblossom Ranch DLC introduced not only new characters for you to welcome home, but a number of new recipes too. There are plenty of ingredients for you to familiarise yourself with as you explore Wishblossom Ranch and its biomes, but none of them really give you any clues what they'd be used for, and Button Stew is not the most intuitive name. Button Stew is likely to pop up in your horse's favourite meals, especially Khan, so you'll want to check the recipe off your list as soon as possible. Even though it's only a two-star entree, it's not an easy dish to guess the ingredients for, and you have to venture a little out of the mountains if you want to batch cook some. How to make Button Stew in Disney Dreamlight Valley To cook Button Stew, you need to take the follow ingredients to a cooking pot either in Remy's Restaurant or outside of your house in Wishblossom Ranch: 1 x Button Mushroom 1 x Carrot If you're not planning on feeding your stew to your horse (or yourself) then you can sell it at Goofy's stall for 375 Star Coins. Alternatively, eating it gives you a decent buff of +135 stamina. Since it's so easy to make as well, it's a decent way to ear…",

Less risk of hypothermia, though my components are perfectly chilly. The Arctic Xtender case is the star of the show here. The cooling company's first case and I dare say a good one. Confusingly for a company famed for its CPU coolers, it focuses on looks, rather than pure cooling ability. Needless to say, it looks absolutely superb under the heavily-tinted mirrored glass surrounding its fishtank-style exterior. It looks so good, in fact, I'm starting to question why I opted for a white build rather than this dashing, icy look.

Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free.

I speak Russian to a reasonable level of fluency and have recently been learning Mandarin. I am here to tell you that underwear Homer's leaked nipples may be the first in Fortnite (via GameSpot ). In what history books will describe as 'the nips seen around the world,' a leaker named Dr Cacahuette posted a \"First look at New (Giant) Homer Skin\" to X yesterday. The figure, unmistakably Homer, is large, and wearing only a pair of tight white briefs, above which loom a speck of belly button and—there, just visible above the orb of his stomach: two dark, mamillary dots. Imagine me tremulously removing a pair of glasses like Walter Cronkite telling you JFK just died.

That's right, Stardew Valley has teamed up with Among Us to bring a bundle of 29 themed cosmetics for your little avatar, so you no longer have to rely on the sprout hat. This package includes things like a Krobus and Junimo Pet, a Mayor Lewis outfit, and a Linius outfit, among many others which will let you cosplay as Abigail, Sebastian, and Mr Qi. No matter how rogue your favourite character is in Stardew, it seems Among Us have tried to create an outfit for everyone in their Cosmicube. For those who don't know what that means, a Cosmicube is basically a bundle of themed cosmetics which you can buy for in-game currency, which in this case is Beans. So there's no need to spend the day growing crops and fishing to be able to afford this one.

Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

The whole thing began innocently enough—or at least so it appeared. Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist. (Image credit: Geoff Keighley (Twitter)) This did not go unnoticed by the ever-sharp Wario64 (via GamesRadar ), who asked, \"What's the one game you have wishlisted?\" Dozens of people shared their theories, and there were many and varied thoughts, but one overarching theme shone through: pic.twitter.com/iQgOlqRPYG November 17, 2025 Keighley himself really set things off, though, with his googly-eyes emoji response: A flood of hope and cope followed from people w…",

Just last week, the Polish developer nabbed one of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 's lead designers to lend their quest-crafting skills to The Witcher 4 . Now, it's hired the former narrative lead of Cloud Chamber Games, the developer that's currently working on BioShock 4 . Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago. The overhaul resulted in the removal of studio head Kelley Gilmore and creative …",

Well, welcome to a new era. Today, after much testing and debate , Jagex finally sent OSRS' first new skill ever out into the world earlier today. Sailing has landed with a—wait for it—splash, and promises to let players \"Take to the high seas, traverse hazardous waters, learn new skill integrations, and finally find out what lies in the uncharted oceans of Gielinor.\" It's not just a new skill, mind you. If you're letting players pilot ships, you're kind of obliged to give them somewhere to go in them and something to do in them. Jagex adjures you to find \"new adventures and NPCs,\" to deal with \"new threats and face monsters from both the sea and the skies,\" and to \"Max out the brand-new Sailing Skill and earn ship upgrades with each new level.\" Also, \"Get to know the Tortugan species on The Great Conch Island.\" Which sounds quite pleasant.

Okay, so they're just screen-printed regular Xbox Wireless controllers, available in both regular and Elite flavours, but even I had to raise a smile at the bizarreness of the design. I mean, the central Xbox button and the X face button are his pupils , for goodness sake. That means you can jab SpongeBob right in his (presumably porous) eyeballs with regularity, which sounds like a fun evening in with the family. They're also available to customise as part of the Xbox Design Lab suite, so you can... I don't know, make them look like SpongeBob has a terrible illness? The Elite version seems to be going that way by default, as the outer grips look to be an odd mix of textured black plastic and bile green stamping.

For a niche RPG with a hefty price tag, that's quite the win. That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side. Despite its poor technical performance, however, I absolutely loved my monster-slaying holiday, giving it 89% in my Dragon's Dogma 2 review . I'll happily put up with a lower fps when I'm climbing up dragons to stab them in the eye or riding ogres like bucking broncos. For others, though, the performance issues were a lot m…",

Although it follows the same process of meeting new characters who need your help, completing their quests to unlock them as friends, and clearing up any chaos caused by some force linked to your trauma, Wishblossom Ranch is unlike any of the expansions Disney Dreamlight Valley has released. Each biome you explore is so different from one another, yet the quests that link them and the relationships between the characters you meet pulls them together in an incredibly neat package.

Well, it was actually created by Roman 'der8auer' Hartung , in conjunction with Jon Sandström of ElmorLabs , to make it easier for them to test motherboards, CPUs, coolers, etc. And since he just so happens to be the CEO of Thermal Grizzly, it's now something that I can use for the same purposes, too. For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing. When I get a new motherboard or CPU to review, I use a basic open-chassis to mount the motherboard and PSU, then wire it all up, and then spend a good amount of time installing the operating system and …",
