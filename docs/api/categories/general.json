As games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said this week , no one really knows, but the speculation we're hearing from analysts and corporate finance experts is that EA's new owners aren't likely to shake things up in the immediate future, and will probably do what you'd expect: focus on its existing live service moneymakers as it pays off that $20 billion in debt. Philip Alberstat, managing director at DBD Investment Bank, doesn't foresee a Toys 'R' Us-style descent into bankruptcy as a result of the new debt on EA's balance sheet. \"EA generates approximately $7.5 billion annually from franchises like Apex Legends, Battlefield, and FIFA [now EA Sports FC],\" said Alberstat. \"That flow of cash gives EA a real capacity to service the $20 billion in debt.

It sucks to acknowledge, but we're living in a new age of crappy PC ports. \"It sure seems like there's something wrong with practically every major big-budget release on PC these days,\" senior editor Wes Fenlon wrote over two years ago . Sadly, not much has changed: The plague of stutters, crashes, and poor framerates has spoiled the launches of some of the biggest games of 2025. There's no one culprit for this widespread problem, but the industry's obsession with graphics is looking guiltier every day. Devs are increasingly happy to sacrifice acceptable performance at the altar of Unreal Engine 5's bells and whistles, serving up games that look slightly better than a handful of years ago (if you squint, and provided you drop a grand on a new video card).

Right? The Halo series began in March of 2022, with a second season following in February 2024 and a third season following never because it was canceled. The show didn't really do all that well critically, as far as I can recall: I don't remember anyone saying they liked it much, though I also didn't hear that it was absolutely terrible.

If you're wondering about that odd name, the Waaagh! is the name of the massive military campaigns the orks wage on the galaxy every now and then when they get feeling restless. It is, as the Fandom wiki describes it, \"war on an apocalyptic scale,\" in which \"whole civilisations are exterminated and defenders' armies laid to waste as the Orks plough ever onward in an unstoppable tide.\" The good news is that these things tend to burn themselves out: Once the Waaagh! (the exclamation point is mandatory) has killed literally everything else, the orks will start fighting amongst themselves, as one does. It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober! Warhammer Bundle is a mix of genres, so you may not find everything here to your liking: Inquisitor‚ÄîMartyr, for instance, is an action RPG, while Vermintide 2 is a co-op shooter and Dakka Squadron is kind of an arcade ‚Ä¶",

Their face is covered by a gas mask under a wide-brimmed helmet like a British WWI soldier, but the rest of the ensemble is all plate mail, and they carry an assortment of both medieval and modern weaponry. The demo showed off the sword, a fast-firing pistol, and a classic trench gun-style shotgun, while the trailers have previewed stranger fare like playing cards you throw like shuriken, a pile bunker , or dual flails.

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem.

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I‚Äôm really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway ‚Ä¶",

To regular folk these may seem plain insanity, but I call them home. And nothing's made me feel more at home playing competitive shooters than the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro , which I've just crowned the best lightweight gaming mouse . The upside is it's fantastic; the downside is it's got me playing Counter-Strike again. Those games ain't quick (especially since they removed the short game mode), and my aim ain't what it once was. But that's improving quickly, in part thanks to the Sabre V2 Pro. I first got my hands on it at Gamescom, though I had to keep schtum about that at the time. But I can tell you now: I was genuinely taken aback by how light it is. I'm used to my Logitech G Pro X Superlight for competitive gaming, and I do still love that mouse , but it weighs 63 g, almost double this Corsair one. Part of what impressed me about the Superlight when I first fell in love with it was how it managed to achieve such a light weight while keeping its shell intact‚Äîsturdy, and free from holes. The Corsair's done that here, too,‚Ä¶",

Both a killer budget-oriented GPU and a bit of an inconsistent mess, it is clear that the hardware is impressive, despite all the crashes we got while testing. What's even less impressive, however, is its performance alongside older processors. The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022. Where the B580 was once outshone by the 8GB AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT in the same test, they now stand neck and neck. However, it's n‚Ä¶",

The buyout is a leveraged buyout, which Darrah says means \"EA is going to have an additional $20 billion of debt on its balance sheet. Obviously, adding $20 billion to your balance sheet is going to require you to pay a lot of interest. If we look at EA's current financials, they're netting out about $1.1-1.2 billion each year.

And, as someone who grew up deeply entrenched in second-generation K-Pop back in the late 2000s, the Saja Boys give me all the same fuzzy feelings that BigBang did back then.
