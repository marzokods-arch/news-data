    "body": "Over the years, Taylor Swift has dabbled in television and film work. (And ultimately has plans to make her feature directorial debut in the future.) Famously, though, there’s one part she auditioned for which she did not receive &#8212; Eponine in the Tom Hopper-directed Les Miserables . In an interview with Graham Norton in 2022, Swift hilariously recounts the process. “I was auditioning for two roles in Les Mis and I had done a few auditions and gone to New York and whatever. I think it had been established that I had more of the look of Cosette, but I had the range vocally of Eponine. So it was established that I was there for a good time, not a long time,” she explained. “But they were like, ‘You know, do you want to come to London for one last screen test? And you’ll get to screen test with Eddie Redmayne.’ And I’m like, ‘This sounds like an experience I want to have in my life.” “I get there and they are like, ‘OK, so we really want to make you look like Eponine.’ She wasn’t, like, loaded.

But when it comes to Ozuna , who’s been repping the bear vibe since his Odisea days, and Beéle , who’s embraced the gorilla image, it was the complete opposite.
