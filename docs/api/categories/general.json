    "body": "There are over 1,300 voice memos on Julia Kugel’s phone. The prolific musician, who is best known as part of the punk trio The Coathangers, explains that every fragmented voice memo is “waiting to be somewhere” whether that’s with The Coathangers, the duo Soft Palms with her husband Scott Montoya, her Suicide Squeeze label supergroup Julia &amp; The Squeezettes, or for her solo work. The random snippets come to her in the middle of conversations with friends or, far too often, while riffing during sound check and they get sorted into files. “I’ll file folder them into which project like Soft Palms or is this Julia, Julia or I just started a new band called Animal Self, so maybe it is Animal Self,” she tells Billboard . &nbsp; The collection of memos started during her Coathangers days when each member would bring the recordings to the studio and collaborate. Eventually, some of those recordings felt as though they were Kugel’s alone to express and so she launched Julia, Julia. &nbsp; Today, Kugel releases her second solo album Sugaring a Strawberry (via Suicide Squeeze and her and Montoya&#8217;s label Happy Sundays) under her moniker Julia, Julia and the 10-track record is an int…",

    "summary": "Android could take another step towards iOS-fication with its new horizontal volume slider layout",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new horizontal layout for Android’s volume slider that will likely appear when the device is in landscape mode. This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

In a social media post, the firm provided another teaser of the design. Nothing ended last week with a teaser revealing that it plans to launch the Nothing Ear (3) soon. No other details were given, so it was anyone’s guess as to how soon “soon” would actually be. But we now have a definitive answer to that question. Once again, Nothing has turned to social media to offer more information about its next flagship TWS earbuds . This time, the company has revealed the launch date for the Nothing Ear (3). As it turns out, we’ll only have to wait a little over a week for the official announcement. According to the post, Nothing will launch the new earbuds on September 18, which is next Thursday.",

The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

In a product sharing session this morning, AYANEO announced pricing on its upcoming KONKR Pocket FIT handheld. The standard model, which has a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, will start at $239 for the 8+128GB model.

For all the promise they offer, projectors have been plagued since day one by compromise after compromise — they may deliver big-screen thrills, but at what cost? Maybe you’ve been let down by poor brightness, resulting in a washed-out picture, or distracting rainbow effects from the way they cycle colors.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority While many of us still upgrade smartphones every 2–4 years on average, tablets tend to have a much longer shelf life. They’re typically used less often and for narrower purposes like video consumption or light productivity. With the arrival of the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra , you might be wondering whether now is finally the right time to replace your aging Galaxy tablet. The answer here isn’t so cut and dry. It’s really less about age and more about whether the new models deliver a meaningful improvement to your existing experience. Let’s dive in a bit deeper and take a look at some of the past models to get a better idea of whether an upgrade is right for you.",

The campaign launches on September 7 at 9:30 AM CST. Right in time for the weekend, AYN has finally announced pricing on its upcoming Odin 3 handheld. A clear upgrade over the Odin 2, it’s the first handheld to officially feature a Snapdragon 8 Elite, and it’s significantly cheaper than expected. Pricing for the Odin 3 starts at $299 for the base 8+128GB model, jumping up to $499 for the maxed-out 24+1TB model. However, there’s a catch. Those are the “Super Early Bird” prices, and they’re only valid for the first 48 hours of the Indiegogo campaign.",
