While Valve's official policy forbids the third party sale of its games' cosmetics, its loot box monetization fuels a massive ecosystem of gambling and speculation—and in an interview with Eurogamer , DayZ and Icarus creator Dean Hall says Valve isn't getting enough flak for creating its own predatory economy. (Image credit: Future) \"It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about,\" Hall said. \"I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in videogames at all—they have absolutely no place.\" Efforts to regulate loot boxes as a form of gambling—like a recent Brazilian law banning the sale of loot boxes to minors—have driven other major games publishers to pursue different monetization tactics in recent years. Valve, however, has managed to neatly skirt regulatory efforts by charging players not for directly purchasing loot crates, which can be earned during gameplay, but for the keys required to open them. In other words, Valve's monetization logic is that it's not gambl…",

Some of the top sellers include nausea-inducing co-op hit The Outlast Trials , going for a 70% discount at $12, surreal card game Inscryption, on sale for $8, and the devastating psychological horror game Mouthwashing , clocking in at $9.09. In his review, PC Gamer associate editor Ted Litchfield called Mouthwashing \"my favorite horror game of 2024, and one of the year's best narratives, period.\" If you're not so keen on scares, there's still plenty on offer. The entire Walking Dead Telltale series is on sale for 5 dollars , vampiric survival superlative V Rising is half-off at $17.49 , and as always, you can grab one of the slickest co-op shooters ever conceived for less than the price of a cup of coffee .

Psychopomp 1 used the grid-based, first person gameplay of old school dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock to make something that plays closer to a PlayStation 2 survival horror game⁠—you move slowly and can't maneuver very well as you navigate dungeons full of slavering flesh beasts, while instead of spells and dice roll attacks, you just have to be close enough to enemies to whack them with a claw hammer. Psychopomp begins with its clearly disturbed (maybe divinely ordained?) protagonist spelunking in the nightmare dungeons hidden under innocuous public buildings before descending even further into a subterranean world, and eventually ringing in some kind of an apocalypse with a doppelganger planet summoned above Earth.

This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick). Instead, I'm suggesting you take a gander at Printables user jq910's wares and 3D print yourself an RTX 5090 FE PCB Drink Coaster (via Videocardz ). Even if you don't already own a 3D printer, I bet this one is a cheaper craft than cracking open a two-grand card. All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files. However, jq910 writes that they chose to omit the power connector \"because it would get in the way of larger cups and also make the coaster annoying to stack.\" As such, jq910's representation of the PCB is somewhat simplified, and also much flatter than the…",

So it's lovely to discover that Mechanicus 2 is shaping up to be even bigger and better. Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away. As Harvey pointed out in his Mechanicus 2 …",

For instance, original Halo designer Jaime Griesemer was vocally disappointed with the new remake , calling it out for mucking with the level design in a way he reckoned was deleterious for the game as a whole. Well, buckle up, because yet another Halo OG has entered the ring and this one's a lot more positive. Marcus Lehto, art director on Halo 1, 2 and 3 and \" father of Master Chief ,\" took to X to declare that he's a fair bit keener on the remake than his former compatriots. \"It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this,\" says the man himself. \"My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this,\" wrote Lehto, \"I absolutely love where this is going.

I am a man on a mission—a mission to roleplay. My craving for quality RPGs never subsides. I finish one, and then I'm off on a new quest, to find another. But like so many RPG protagonists before me, I'm also cursed. Specifically, I live with the curse of having played too many great RPGs, which means that even a perfectly fine one just doesn't cut the mustard. For a week now, I have been trying to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 . I tried to shed all my expectations and just go with the flow, to immerse myself in the off-kilter sci-fi universe that Obsidian has created. But folks, I simply cannot get into it. And this time I can't blame its proximity to Disco Elysium.

You can't quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.\" As the article notes, Layden's tenure oversaw a trio of Sony's singleplayer knockouts, and part of why he left the company was due to their live-service pivot, which he quips were \"not my skillset.\" Layden oversaw God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.

We could also see something new from AMD and Intel, but there hasn't been much gossip about these so far. When is Black Friday 2025?

Mid-range buyers will be well-served by RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti machines, whereas if you've got the cash to splash, even RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 gaming PCs will be dropping in price. Oh, and don't rule out AMD GPUs, either. The RX 9060 XT is an excellent budget gaming graphics card, while the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are very quick mid-range performers.
