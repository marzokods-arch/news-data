So, when he announced his upcoming slate of concerts last week (Jan. 22), billed as Together, Together, social media lit up with fan reactions and presale registrations exploded to eight figures. Still, it isn’t a typical world tour and will behave very differently from his past tours, from the general ticket on sales to its Boxscore receipts. Styles first became a touring giant as a member of One Direction. The group released music and toured at shocking clip, yielding a combined $583.6 million and 7.1 million tickets sold, all between 2012-15, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. Those are giant numbers in a vacuum, and stand tall amid competition, as the group’s Where We Are Tour finished at No. 1 on 2014’s year-end Top Tours ranking.

The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions.

Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu.

Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

    "body": "TL;DR Belkin will shut down its Wemo cloud service for smart home devices later this week. Around two dozen devices are at risk of going obsolete, but you might be eligible for a partial refund if you bought them recently. However, if your device supports Apple HomeKit or Thread, it is immune to the shutdown. The shutdown date for Belkin’s Wemo smart home app is almost upon us. On January 31, 2026, Wemo’s cloud service will be shuttered, and any devices that run on it will effectively be turned into dumb devices (if they can still function, as with light bulbs). Therefore, Belkin is sending final reminders to owners and telling them they may be eligible for refunds in certain cases. After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed. In its email to existing users, Belkin also notes that while its Wemo cloud interface is shutting down, devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit or Thread’s IoT protocol will continue to work through their respective services.",

Samsung has offered Olympic Edition Galaxy Z Flip models for a few years now, and with the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics upon us, the company has now launched another special edition Flip phone. Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 Olympic Edition today, and, much like previous models, it offers a unique design.

The A57 could be just 6.9mm thick, matching rumored Galaxy S26 dimensions. TENAA photos show the same vertical camera layout and Key Island buttons, now paired with what appears to be a metal frame. Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

The text prompts can be refined after your first pass, and Google will also offer suggestions. We previously spotted the custom prompt option in testing. When Google first rolled out its AI photo-to-video tools in Google Photos, the idea was nice, but the execution could feel a little hit-or-miss. You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",
