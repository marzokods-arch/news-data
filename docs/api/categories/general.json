Like the company behind it , EU has had a fraught journey over the years—and as EU lead Johan Andersson explained in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , the early days were spent trying to keep the lights on. Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing. I think we, in two or three meetings, wrote down, like, three pages of ideas, and it's 'Okay, we need to get this game out quickly, and it needs to be done so it's sold in the US market before Christmas, because we need the money [or] else we cannot pay people.'\" That didn't curb the team's ambitions, mind you. Players had already tinkered with EU1—wherein you selected from a small batch of scenarios, each with a designated playable nation—to make any country accessible from the get. The mod maker behind that feature, named Henrik Fåhraeus, was hired as content designer for the sequel, which aimed to have every country playable in the base game; today, Fåhraeus is Paradox's chief creative officer. \"So, that's a good hire.

In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005.

A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really.

Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase.

Not because it's informative, or the community is a lovely bunch, though both of those things are true. It's the best because it has thread titles like \"My son became a German and now my empire is dying\", constant grousing about whatever the Pope's getting up to, and endless hand-rubbing about what to do (or what not to do) with wives, heirs, and all those vassals any self-respecting Crusader King collects. This week's quiz is a simple one. There are 15 thread titles here. To prove your worth, separate the real from the made up.

Our selection changes substantially year-to-year as the PC Gamer team grows, tastes change, and classics are reevaluated. In 2012, Skyrim was #1. This year, it didn't make the cut at all.

Not now, but maybe next time. \"We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete,\" today's blog post reads. For those who haven't had the displeasure of grinding challenges required to unlock many gadgets and guns in Battlefield 6, their requirements range from unreasonable, to annoying, to straight up broken. Suppress 300 enemy players? Sounds simple, except the definition of suppression is a moving target (or currently broken). Repair 6,000 vehicle HP in a single round? Yea sure, right after I learn to levitate on command. Land 150 sniper rifle headshots at over 200 meters?

Specifically, it's about shooting ducks as a duck. Normally my friend group would be buzzing about the meme game of the week, but it feels like I don't know anyone outside the PCG team who's actually playing Escape From Duckov . Turns out it's mostly popular in China, which is becoming more and more common on Steam—but it's still a total upset of the usual trending game pattern, because Duckov is a singleplayer game with an $18 price tag. (Image credit: Team Soda) Since its launch this week, most of Escape From Duckov's players are in China: You can clearly spot that its player count ( via Steam.db ) spikes in the evenings for China's timezone (about half its peak count happening at 10pm Pacific) and that 64% of its user reviews on Steam are in Chinese. It's not uncommon for games to have a huge audience in a different market, but when Chinese players rocket a new release to the top of the charts it's usually a free-to-play online game.

As PC Gamer's Rory Norris described it last week, \" Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times , especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas.\" That's not great when everyone in your vicinity is doing their damnedest to shoot you. Turning down the \"world brightness\" in Battlefield 6's graphics menu helps make the game a little easier on the eyeballs, but the update promise of \"improved exposure transitions between indoor and outdoor areas for better visibility\" sounds like a better option.

It's, I don't know, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sleepless in Seattle or something. All I know is that it's definitely not Bloodlines, and slapping that name on The Chinese Room's game was a mistake. (Image credit: The Chinese Room) More than a mistake, it was a disservice to the game itself. Here's the thing: I very much enjoyed Bloodlines 2. It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately. It's a great Vampire game, but not a great Bloodlines game, and that latter name only ever detracts from the game we ended up getting 21 years after an RPG that people are still replaying today.

My 8BitDo Retro R8 isn't as competitively viable as the Logitech I swapped it out for, but it is more convenient. The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room. It comes with a compartment underneath to plug in a 2.4 GHz dongle, which means, if you plug the dock into your PC, it will both charge your controller and work as your connector.

Given each game has 87 bazillion guns (give or take a bazillion), shields and mods to loot, Gearbox likes to sneak in a few dashes of joke sauce to its equipment soup. The bit this time? The shield doms you. You take damage or do anything, and the Cindershelly will let you know that you're subhuman scum. Here are a couple of sample lines, courtesy of our poor put-upon guides writer, Rory Norris, who had some things to say about it last month : \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" \"Did you let go without asking first?\" \"Don't stop till I allow it\" \"Worship me\" \"Show me how close you can get, worm\" \"What an obedient worm you are\" As Rory explained, the shield was very chatty.

With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking.
