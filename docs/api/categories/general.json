The Google Pixel Watch features a Watch Unlock function that allows you to use the smartwatch as a key to unlock your Pixel phone. This is very convenient, as it replaces the need for a traditional passcode or biometric identification as long as you’re wearing the watch (and it’s connected to your phone). Although the feature is great, there are instances when you don’t want your watch to unlock your phone. Google could soon update the Watch Unlock functionality to prevent your phone from unlocking with the Pixel Watch when security features like Android Advanced Protection Mode are enabled.

Complaints on Google’s support forum and Reddit indicate that the issue occurs only on Android devices. There’s no fix yet, and TeamYouTube has asked people to submit feedback. Just as the time for holiday playlists to be finalized approaches, some YouTube Music Premium listeners say their downloaded tracks have suddenly stopped working. Offline songs that played normally a few days ago are now stuck on a loading spinner, even though streaming the same tracks works without issue. PiunikaWeb spotted the growing number of complaints across Google’s support forums and Reddit. On the support forum, one Galaxy S24 Ultra user says they tried everything from clearing cache and data to rolling back to an older version, but playback still breaks the moment they download anything. Two other forum posters report the same thing, with one noting that disabling downloads entirely is the only way music will play.",

To celebrate, Google is giving away 15x Play Points on Play Books purchases through December 7. That’s a reward of 15 points per dollar spent for every Play Points user on any level. Google’s Play Store is known for being the official Android app marketplace, but the Play Store is also the home for buying movies, TV shows, books, and more. Google Play Books has become a great source for buying e-books, and it’s one of our favorite e-book storefronts on Android. The Google Play Books platform is turning 15 this weekend, and book-lovers on Android get to celebrate the milestone with a major Play Points offer. In a blog post, Google announced that every Google Play Points user can earn bonus Play Points on any e-book purchase this weekend, spanning December 5 to December 7. Specifically, they’ll get 15 times the normal Play Points rewards for every Play Books purchase across the three-day window. The 15x Play Points promo is an obvious nod to Play Books’ birthday, and it’s a great way to stock up on rewards points while padding your e-book collection in the process.",

The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

It operates on T-Mobile’s network, but does not store names, addresses, or payment details. Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data. If you’ve ever felt uneasy about how much your phone company knows about you, you might soon have a more private option. Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade. He has now launched Phreeli, a new mobile carrier that lets you sign up with nothing more than your ZIP code. As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",
