    "body": "TL;DR Eden is a Nintendo Switch emulator designed to pick up where Yuzu left off. Earlier this month, it made the notable step of offering installation through the Play Store. Now Eden’s Play Store listing is no longer active, leaving us wondering what exactly happened. Maintaining a gaming emulator sounds like a rough job. Not only do you want to keep users happy, always endeavoring to improve compatibility and stomp out bugs, but you’ve got to avoid pissing off big companies who could seriously undermine your efforts, whether those are console manufacturers themselves or the people behind app stores. Earlier this month, we shared some big news for emulation on Android as we spotted the Eden Emulator landing in the Play Store. And now, just two weeks later, it’s already gone.

    "body": "After spending some time away rapping, Doja Cat is back in full pop star mode on her new album Vie . The Californian singer&#8217;s new project dropped on Friday (Sept. 26) and includes one sole feature from Doja’s “Kiss Me More“ sister, SZA. The album also includes the lead single “Jealous Type,” which Doja performed at the 2025 VMAs alongside saxophonist Kenny G. The album is a pop record through and through, with Doja previously stating this album wouldn&#8217;t be as rap heavy as her 2023 album Scarlet . Vie dives straight into the 80s disco energy that has perforated pop music for some time now, and despite some bars here and there from Doja, never strays too away from the that. The singer and rapper also did what all artists do when they wanna make a massive pop record: She linked with Jack Antonoff. “I’m working with Jack Antonoff and working with a person that’s new in my life,” she told Zane Lowe in an interview with Apple Music. “And so it’s the grappling with talking about something personal and creating something fresh, and then getting to know someone new, and then all of these things fell together really naturally. He’s been such a wonderful person to work with.” So …",

Lyrically, “París” finds the&nbsp; Panameño &nbsp;stars singing about a former ex-couple who are in a new relationship, but are receiving unrequited love. “It seems like they don’t love you, that’s why you’re calling me/ I saw your photo in Paris, you don’t look happy, stop pretending/ they don’t love me either, that’s why I answered your call,” go the ultra-relatable lyrics.

New paid options are meant to address the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office consent or pay guidance that says online services must allow users to pay a fee in order to “avoid their personal information being used for personalised advertising” — exactly what Meta is doing here. For now, the option is exclusive to the UK. UK-based users are getting options to pay £2.99 (~$4) a month to opt out of ads on the web, or £3.99 (~$5) a month to remove ads from the Facebook and Instagram mobile apps.

Google’s Clock app is one of the better timekeeping apps available for Wear OS. If you want to install it on your device, you may run into a bit of trouble if you have a non-Pixel smartwatch. It appears the app has recently gone missing from the Play Store for these users. We have spotted multiple reports from non-Pixel smartwatch owners that Google’s Clock app is no longer available for installation from the Play Store. These reports span across Reddit , Google’s support page , and reviews in the app’s Play Store listing . Based on the reports we were able to find, it appears the problem primarily affects various Galaxy Watch and OnePlus Watch models. Even if the app is already installed, some users are seeing that the app description in the Play Store says that their device is not supported.",

Numerous reports indicate that watching a single channel appears fine, but the quality severely degrades when watching two, three, or four channels at once. This is reportedly happening even with fast, wired internet connections and with other streaming apps running fine, suggesting it may be an issue with YouTube TV itself. YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",

You’ll pay just $180 a year for service, which works out to $15 a month. The plan includes unlimited data, with speeds only deprioritized after 35GB and only during congestion. Earlier this summer, Mint Mobile brought back its exceptional 50% off promotion for annual customers interested in an unlimited plan. If you’ve yet to take advantage, you don’t have much longer, as the promotion is set to end on the last day of September. While it’s possible the deal will return eventually, it’s unlikely to return anytime soon. This deal brings service down to the equivalent of just $15 a month, though you’ll have to pay the full $180 upfront. To say that this is ridiculously cheap for truly unlimited would be an understatement.",

The OnePlus 15 is confirmed to arrive with a 165Hz display and the recently unveiled Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The reviewer confirms that the increase to 165Hz refresh rate aids in gameplay, especially for FPS games. Qualcomm’s latest flagship chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, is less than a week old. And in the mere span of two days, we’ve already seen the first set of phones, under the Xiaomi 17 series , launch with this chipset. Meanwhile, other brands have also confirmed their flagship devices to be powered by the same chipset . One of the upcoming phones, the OnePlus 15, has been officially teased with a redesigned camera island . Even before the phone’s launch, we’ve come across the OnePlus 15 being put through its paces for a performance and gaming review. The review comes courtesy of YouTuber Geekerwan, who has tested the OnePlus 15’s performance in a wide range of synthetic benchmarks, as well as in resource-intensive game titles. According to the reviewer, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 outshines Apple’s A19 Pro seen on the iPhone 17 Pro , as well as …",

Android’s Live Caption is a useful accessibility feature that enables subtitles for virtually any audio playing on your phone or tablet. It even works when the device’s volume is turned down to zero, allowing you to experience sound — while also emphasizing expressions — without needing to raise the volume. Its placement right under the volume slider makes it easy to access, unless you’re using a Pixel device, where accessing the toggle takes an additional step. Google now appears to realize that placement may not be intuitive and is working to improve it.

Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method.

In one day, not only did we see the Pixel 10 series debut, but we got both our first Android 16 QPR2 beta and the release of Android Canary 2508 . One month later, it’s time for Google’s next build, and today Android Canary 2509 is on its way out to testers.",

This is available in the latest public beta version of the Phone app. Google’s Calling Cards rolled out to the Phone app last month. Similarly to iOS’s Contact Poster feature, Calling Cards let you create custom screens for your contacts that’ll appear when those contacts call you. Now, we’ve spotted an upcoming tweak that makes your Cards even more customizable. Testing the latest beta version of the Google Phone app, we found a small but interesting change to font customization. You’ve been able to choose from a number of different typefaces that your contact’s name will appear in on their Calling Card since the feature was introduced, but now, you can manually tweak several aspects of the font to create a more custom one.",

So far, all you’ve needed to activate it was your phone number — so anyone who knew it could potentially lock your phone. That’s now slightly more secure with the addition of an optional security question. Google offers plenty of automatic ways to try and limit your exposure when someone takes off with your smartphone. Features like Theft Detection use sensors to know when a thief grabs your phone and makes a break for it, while Offline Device Lock prevents a thief from using a lack of connectivity to give them more time with an unlocked handset. Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools. And if you’re using 2FA like you should, signing into a new device without your phone could be a little tricky. With Remote Lock turned on, all you need is your phone number and a web browser — you just go to android.com/lock and enter your number…",

It’s selling for $199 at Verizon, and will soon be available at Total Wireless. If you’re looking for a budget-level tablet, there are plenty of options to choose from. TCL’s tablets, in particular, stand out from the rest of the crowd due to the company’s innovative NXTPAPER tech. It’s a smooth, textured display that feels a lot like paper and offers a few benefits, like reducing eye strain and not attracting fingerprints. Earlier this year, TCL debuted the next generation of this display, NXTPAPER 4.0 , with the NXTPAPER 11 Plus. Now the manufacturer is putting this tech in a new tablet that’s even more affordable. Today, TCL announced the launch of a compact tablet called the TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G. As mentioned earlier, this device features an NXTPAPER 4.0 display. That screen measures 8.7 inches and has a resolution of 800 x 1,340. With this tech, you can switch the screen to Eye Comfort Mode, which uses AI to adjust screen settings based on what you’re doing, like reading or watching a video.",

Why would you buy that slow thing?” they ask. “For the same amount of money, you could get a Porsche 911! It can go from zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds, bro!”",

Last month, Google rolled out Nano Banana , its newest AI-powered image editing tool, inside the Gemini app. Since then, it’s sparked viral trends online, from turning selfies into 3D figurines to erasing fences from photos, generating images from scratch, adding scenic backdrops, and even experimenting with new looks. The best thing about Nano Banana is that it isn’t locked behind a paywall. It’s available in every country, across personal, work, and paid versions of Gemini, so just about anyone can try it out. Now, it seems Google is preparing to bring the magic of Nano Banana to an even wider audience by building it directly into Google Photos.

YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone. The site has long struggled to take appropriate measures to protect its young and vulnerable users, while still letting adults enjoy more mature material — within reason. Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history.

Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung users would first choose a Google Pixel phone if forced to give up their Galaxy. OnePlus is the only other brand to score more votes than Samsung die-hards who refuse to try other phones. Loyalty will only take you so far in life, and while we still value it enormously when it comes to personal and professional relationships, are you really doing yourself any favors by remaining ceaselessly loyal to a big, faceless smartphone conglomerate? Sure, if one manufacturer keeps knocking it out of the park, year after year, we’re definitely going to want to check out their latest offerings — but if that’s the only brand you pay attention to, you risk doing yourself a major disservice. Among companies making and selling Android phones, Samsung’s held a prominent spot for years, and to a distressingly large number of users, “Android” might as well be synonymous with “Galaxy.” But even with so many users turning to Samsung phones every time they’re shopping for a new handset, could we maybe convince some of you to see if the grass is any greener in another OEM’s pasture?",

For comparison, the haptic motor on the OnePlus 13 is an AAC CSA+0916 Turbo (602mm²). The pieces of the OnePlus 15 puzzle are slowly coming together, leak after leak. Based on the information we have so far, it looks like the Android flagship will come with at least a few compromises. Adding to that list of compromises is a new leak related to the haptic motor. According to a leak from OnePlus Club , the OnePlus 15 will feature a downgraded haptic motor. The haptic motor in this handset will reportedly be an AAC ESA1016 (560mm²). For comparison, the OnePlus 13 has an AAC CSA+0916 Turbo (602mm²) haptic motor. It’s not a huge downgrade, but a downgrade is still a downgrade.",

    "body": "Android phones are wonderful gadgets that can do pretty much anything, but their screens are too small for some tasks. That’s why tablets make for great secondary devices, but choosing the right one can be a challenge. For years, I’ve been on the “bigger is better” train, using Android tablets with 11-inch or larger screens. But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

For me, the best Android phones are the ones that not only lack any noticeable flaws but also have a unique hook that makes them special, whether it’s a clever AI feature or new hardware used in an interesting way. Xiaomi’s T series has generally ticked the right boxes for what makes a good smartphone, but it’s always lacked that one extra feature to make it exciting. The new Xiaomi 15T is a great device with solid all-around specs and some welcome generational improvements, like a better telephoto lens, a bigger battery, and a larger display. However, it also breaks from the T series mold by bringing a seldom-seen feature to mobile devices: an offline communication mode that effectively turns your phone into a walkie-talkie.",
