    "body": "In the second episode of Billboard and The Players&#8217; Tribune&#8217;s video series Switching Stages, Normani and Two-Time Olympian Jordan Chiles take turns stepping into each other&#8217;s shoes for the day. Normani is no stranger to gymnastics, so had the opportunity to perform sophisticated cartwheels and aerials on the beam while Jordan helped her utilize some expert-level technique and form. Elsewhere, the pair stepped into Normani&#8217;s world, and learned some tight choreography to Normani&#8217;s song &#8220;All Yours.&#8221; &#8220;I actually feel inspired to continue to get back into the gym,&#8221; Normani told Jordan after their afternoon together. &#8220;You actually inspired me to start dancing,&#8221; Jordan replied before going in for a high five. The second episode of Switching Stages comes after Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young and Grammy-nominated rapper Quavo spent some time sharing nostalgic stories of growing up in Atlanta.

Ice reunites with frequent collaborator RIOTUSA on the production side for the trippy drill-leaning tune. The Bronx native cycles through her typical themes as she addresses the haters, flaunts her looks, deep pockets and how you&#8217;ll never hit. &#8220;Pretty Privilege, that&#8217;s a perk/ I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;m a flirt/ Fine s—t, that&#8217;s a fact/ From the front, you see the back/ PR said no clappin&#8217; back, mwah,&#8221; she raps to close out the track.
