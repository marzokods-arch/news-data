Speaking at a preview event for KCD 2's upcoming Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC (via GamesRadar ) communications director Tobias Stolz-Zwilling laid out Warhorse's battle plan. \"We, at Warhorse Studios, absolutely feel at home in the RPG genre. We want to establish ourselves as the new kings of RPGs.\" As for how Warhorse intends to achieve this, Stolz-Zwilling believes the studio is already on the right track, in the way KCD 2 blends detailed quest design with a reactive, open-ended world that recalls the emergent delights of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion . This, Stolz-Zwilling says, will carry through into whatever Warhorse makes next: \"We believe that we have our own formula here, and that we define them in a specific way, and our next project will go the same direction. It will definitely be immersive RPGs.\" Needless to say, Warhorse has some stiff competition. Curren…",

It's set in a walled corporate city in the aftermath of a mysterious cataclysm. Teen protagonist Luca loses her legs during the calamity and is left for dead, but fortunately it's not long before she's possessed by a demon called Rhem, who grants her some new insectile legs on the proviso they collaborate on an escape from the ruined city. As far as pacts with the devil go, it's pretty rational. The 20-odd hour metroidvania that ensues has a lot to admire about it, but doesn't buck nor create any trends. Before the fall, the corporate doyens of this walled city, Agradyne, siphoned a resource called Chroma from captured demons, which was used to power the batteries they sold.

At some point, she would get pregnant, and the resulting child—named, in the blunt language of early CRPGs, \" Aerie's Baby \"—would hold eternal tenure in your already-limited inventory, in a space you might otherwise put a bundle of arrows or a longsword. This is a sequence of events which I now regard as having ruined all of videogames. (Image credit: BioWare) To be fair to poor, pinioned Aerie, she was not the only option in the game's ragbag of sweethearts, but she is the one that sticks in my memory, mostly because of the storage baby. But the shape of BG2's romances is the shape of so many RPG romances since. Swap out Aerie for Liara, Viconia for Lae'zel, Anomen for Alistair—decades later and we're still wooing the same hotties by different names. It does not work for me.

If you're mindful of the potential consequences of exposing yourself to plague and spreading it around, you'll want to do as the physicians suggest and craft yourself a plague mask as part of the Prevention quest. The bad news is that Sedletz Monastery has gone into lockdown, its monks into seclusion, and the abbot has ordered you to stay put in the infirmary, and absolutely not go sneaking about investigating the source of the plague. But sneaking about you will go if you want to grab the necessary materials for the plague mask, so make sure to avoid guards and save often. If one does spot you, either try to sprint into a safe, non-private area, or simply ask them to take you back to the infirmary by replying. This will save you getting dragged before the abbot and, if you're like me, having all those golden crucifixes you stole taken away.

Unfortunately, Bethesda appears to have dropped the birthday cake on its way to the party, as players report some pretty serious issues with the Creation Bundle and its contents. At the time of writing, Fallout 4—Creations Bundle sat at a \"Mostly Negative\" Steam rating with 124 reviews—quite a lot for what is essentially an asset pack. While some of the reviews complain about the price and the pack's content—which is apparently a repackaging of items that were already available on the Creations Store—the bulk of the complaints lament that the pack doesn't actually work. \"Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can't even use Task Manager or Steam to force close,\" writes Steam user HemlokGaming . Meanwhile, grimengine states that the Creation Bundle \"actually made the game buggier, and somehow makes the game crash PC-breakingly hard when trying to do the simple action of closing the game.…",

In the Netflix promo material showing Elordi transforming into 'The Creature' for the role, we can see him busting out a Steam Deck to pass the time on, in addition to checking his phone and reading. Apparently, the transformation into Frankie's creature took 10 hours , so bringing a Deck to the makeup/SFX seat was certainly prudent.

A new generation of OLED panel is always exciting, but how much of an upgrade is it over the best currently available OLED monitors ? Does it fix OLED's full-screen brightness limitations? What about QD-OLED's specific problems with ambient light and font rendering? What does a 500 Hz OLED actually look like set to full reheat? Hold those thoughts while we cover off this new display's various speeds and feeds. Along with the lofty 500 Hz refresh and 2,560 by 1,440 native resolution, you get OLED's characteristic uber-low response times, which come in at a claimed 0.03 ms. No question, this thing is built for speed. It's also engineered to be brighter than previous displays that rely on Samsung's QD-OLED technology. Right at the beginning of the year at the CES show, Samsung unveiled the next step in its QD-OLED roadmap .

Well, it's back again, this time in the form of a small update: the Freestyle Edge RGB Plus . When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps. These used to be optional extras (and quite pricey, too), but now they're included in the box.

There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table.

Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode.
