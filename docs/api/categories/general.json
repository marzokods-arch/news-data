Trying out beta software means accepting some level of risk, but how much do you really expect to break when running an Android beta? Maybe Google Wallet stops working? Fingerprint sensor shuts down? A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software.

So far, you‚Äôve managed your Play Points directly through the Play Store app. Now Google Wallet has started giving users the option to add Play Points as a loyalty card. Google Wallet is far more than just a place to keep your credit cards, and the app has evolved into a digital card hub that‚Äôs truly worthy of its name, carrying everything from travel passes to loyalty cards. That latter addition is one we‚Äôve seen the app been giving some special attention to this year, building out tools to help you keep them current and surface the right one at the right time . Now we‚Äôre learning about the latest loyalty card perk coming to Wallet, as the app begins supporting Google Play Points. Don‚Äôt want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is reportedly running a new $830 ‚Äúany condition‚Äù trade-in offer (Promo R339) that began on October 2 and includes many older Android and iPhone models. The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 ‚Äúany condition‚Äù trade-in offer.",

Original article, October 3, 2025 (11:04 AM ET): You‚Äôd be forgiven for wincing a little anytime you see the name of one of your favorite streaming services pop in a news feed, as how often is it good news? If it‚Äôs not upcoming shows being shelved over fears of upsetting just the worst people, it‚Äôs news of price hike after price hike driving up your monthly bills.

    "body": "Credit: Ohsnap TL;DR MCON, a unique sliding mobile controller that attaches via magnets, is now available for purchase. It features TMR sticks, analog triggers, gyro controls, flip-out handles, an optional dock for external displays, and more. Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded ‚Äúswitchblade‚Äù mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

    "body": "Samsung took a swing at the thin-and-light smartphones category with the Galaxy S25 Edge , releasing the phone before Apple could release the iPhone Air . Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge‚Äôs sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

Innovation is dead, one could easily argue in the context of phone designs. In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone‚Äôs look by altering how the camera appears.
