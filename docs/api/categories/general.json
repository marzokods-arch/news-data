While the continued success of his Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit “Mutt” has proven Thomas is no underdog anymore, its “Live From NPR’s Tiny Desk” version is up for best R&amp;B performance. (The original version was commercially released on Aug. 8, 2024, during the eligibility period for the 2025 Grammy Awards, and it was submitted for consideration then. Thomas released the 5-song Mutt (Live From NPR’s Tiny Desk) EP on Aug. 15, 2025, which qualifies for next year’s ceremony.) Its parent album, which shares the same title, is nominated for best R&amp;B album, while its tracks “Vibes Don’t Lie” and “Yes It Is” are up for best traditional R&amp;B performance and best R&amp;B song, respectively. Following Thomas, Durand Bernarr has the second most nominations in the R&amp;B field with three: best traditional R&amp;B performance (“Here We Are”), best R&amp;B song (“Overqualified”) and best progressive R&amp;B album ( Bloom ). He only scored his first Grammy…",

For the second consecutive year, Kendrick Lamar leads all contenders with a staggering nine nominations, courtesy of his late-2024 masterclass, GNX. After last year’s dominant run, capped by him ultimately claiming song and record of the year for “Not Like Us” at the Grammys in February, Lamar is looking to go back-to-back, with “Luther” also recognized in both categories. Joining him in the Big Four categories are fellow rap titans Tyler, The Creator and the Clipse, both of whom are nominated for album of the year. Tyler’s Chromokopia flexed his creative range and unfiltered candor, while Clipse’s unapologetic return to their trademark druglord narratives with Let God Sort Em Out sparked a wave of critical acclaim and Grammy contention.

You can currently filter reviews by score, date, or even specific topics, but you can’t add new topics yourself. It’s not yet functional, but some new code strings in the Play Store app suggest that Google’s working on a review search tool. Reviews have to be one of the most frustrating-to-navigate components of life online — one that we nonetheless find ourselves returning to time and time again. When you don’t know exactly what the best option for you is just yet, a good user review can really be illuminating. But finding that good one can sometimes require trudging through screens of low-quality submissions, AI slop, and even the work of paid shills. If you’re looking for some help finding the one review that really speaks to your needs, the Google Play Store appears to be working on a tool that might be right up your alley.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR The upcoming “Insights” feature in Google Messages will use Gemini to provide a concise, three-point summary of shared links. The feature will be able to use both the provided link information and external web searches, and it will notify the user if it retrieves data from outside sources. Dual-SIM users will soon get a clearer interface, with the SIM carrier name returning to the compose box. When we previously spotted Google Messages’ upcoming Insights feature , there were barely any clues about its functionality. We presumed that Insights would provide a quick summary of the web page, and to that extent, our presumption is correct. We now have more details about the output you can expect when you press the Insights button, as well as other changes that Google is working on in the Messages app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Among those pledges was a focus on how well the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been doing in terms of sales and public reception, and a vague promise to keep innovating within the foldable lineup and “provide new experiences.” I’m sure Samsung is subtly hinting at its upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold with its impressive tablet-and-phone design, but I do hope the allure of a hot new form factor doesn’t let the Korean giant forget about its existing Fold line-up. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has already impressed us, but it still needs two major upgrades next year, and I don’t think Samsung should rest on its laurels or skip them.",

    "body": "TL;DR A noted leaker has contradicted a recent rumor about the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera. According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

I’m not alone — hundreds of users have voiced the same complaint about Google Home across social media. Luckily, Gemini looks like it’s on track to revive Google Home’s usefulness but I’m equally concerned that it will introduce problems of its own. Given that I already have Google’s AI Pro subscription , I’m also looking forward to using Gemini Live — the two-way voice conversation feature that won’t require a wakeword every single time.

Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display.

Sometimes you get one of those texts that you don’t want to reply to right away, but also don’t want to forget about entirely as more messages arrive. That’s where pinned conversations come in handy, keeping your most important threads at the top of your inbox so they don’t get buried under new ones.

That network covers roughly half a million square miles of the US where normal cell service doesn’t reach.
