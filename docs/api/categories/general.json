    "body": "TL;DR The editing interface in Google Photos now supports a light-theme editing interface on Android. The editor’s theme follows your device settings. We saw this change in development last year, but it seems to be rolling out broadly this week. Back in November, we spotted that Google was cooking up a new light theme for the image editor in Google Photos. At the time, enabling this look took some tinkering — but now, the new light theme is rolling out publicly in multiple versions of the Photos Android app. The editing view for Google Photos has historically featured a dark gray background. That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time.

Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured.

Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports.

And while it’s on track to launch as a new device, most people will agree it offers only minor improvements over the Galaxy S25 Ultra. That said, there are some new details rumored for the Galaxy S26 Ultra that could make it desirable to some users, whether they are using an older Samsung device or looking to switch from another phone brand. Irrespective of what we say, Samsung is already preparing to sell a boatload of Galaxy S26 Ultra units. It reportedly plans to produce roughly 3.6 million units for sale in the first wave after launch. Of course, not all upgrades will appeal equally to every buyer, and we want you to tell us which ones excite you.",

    "body": "The idea of the ultimate Google Pixel feature is difficult to envisage, because who knows what our smartphones will be capable of in five or ten years? However, when your flagship Pixel doesn’t have a feature that another brand already offers, it’s not unrealistic to hope that Google will introduce it to its own lineup sooner rather than later. With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game. Let’s take a look at the results.",

From an angle, the screen should appear black, while the user still gets a normal, bright view head-on. If you usually buy those dark, grainy privacy screen protectors as soon as you get a new phone, you might want to wait before ordering one for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Samsung seems ready to fix your shoulder surfer problem with hardware, and now there’s software evidence to prove it. After months of rumors about the Flex Magic Pixel technology , a new slip-up from Samsung has effectively confirmed the existence of a built-in Privacy Display. A screenshot shared by the Good Lock team (via Tarun Vats) shows a new quick toggle for this feature in an early version of One UI 8.5 .",

We have some insight on the subject, but we also wanted to know what our well-informed readership thought, so we decided to poll you on which Android OEM had the best year overall. To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",

If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship.

Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels.
