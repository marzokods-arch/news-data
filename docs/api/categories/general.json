    "body": "Credit: Google TL;DR Google’s new smart speaker may be called the “Google Home Speaker.” It’s reported that the device may support “360 audio.” The APK teardown also appears to confirm the rebrand of Nest Aware to “Google Home Premium.” During Made by Google in August, you may recall that an unfamiliar piece of hardware made a brief surprise appearance. The device was a smart speaker that looked like a cross between an Amazon Echo Dot and an Apple HomePod Mini. While Google has yet to say anything about the smart speaker since the teaser, a new report may have revealed some details. According to strings in version 3.41 of Google Home for Android (via 9to5Google ), this unannounced device may be called the “Google Home Speaker.” This is interesting as it signals a departure from the Nest branding and a homecoming to the Google Home naming scheme. Of course, it’s always possible that this name could just be a placeholder.",

According to the Fulton County Magistrate in Georgia, Cardi filed for divorce from Offset nearly three years later, on Sept. 15, 2020. The two eventually got back together weeks later, only for Cardi to file for divorce again in the summer of 2024.

Users have recently noticed that this no longer holds true, and some devices set to auto-rotate will turn even in calls. We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones. We discovered evidence for the new setting in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, but the setting isn’t live yet. For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation. Fortunately, Google is finally adding an option to reverse the buttons in the navigation bar. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The latest of these, Beta 2, is now rolling out to compatible Pixel devices and includes a long-awaited customization feature. Custom icon shapes As expected for a later beta release, Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 doesn’t pack as many new features as last month’s QPR2 Beta 1 release, focusing more on refining the build ahead of its stable launch. Still, the update delivers on a much-anticipated feature: the icon shape customization options we first spotted in the 2508 Android Canary release.",

The manufacturer also confirms specs, which are almost perfectly in line with those of the RG Slide. Smartphones may be our bread and butter, but we are absolute suckers around here for a nice handheld gaming console — so we were understandably very excited earlier this month when we got word about the ANBERNIC RG 476H on the way. At the time we made some inferences about the hardware we were likely to get, and it sure felt like this model could be shaping up to be a budget-friendly alternative to some of its peers. Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung. Where the base model Galaxy S has long felt overlooked and underpowered, the new “Pro” moniker led me to believe that the Galaxy S26 Pro could be the true compact flagship phone I’ve wanted from Samsung for so long.",

Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker.

So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Gboard’s Writing Tools, an on-device AI feature, is reportedly being rolled out to the Pixel 8 series. A user with a Pixel 8 Pro running the latest Gboard beta release has received the feature. The feature’s expansion suggests that Google may gradually add more older devices to the list of supported phones. AI features formed some of the Pixel 10 series ‘ core new highlights, one of which was Writing Tools in Gboard . Thanks to its integration into the keyboard app, this tool allows users to use on-device AI to proofread or rephrase their text in any text field. Shortly after the Pixel 10’s launch, Google expanded Gboard Writing Tools to the Pixel 9 series and some new non-Pixel devices. It seems Writing Tools is all set for another expansion, as we’ve now received a report that it is available on a Pixel 8 series phone. Telegram user Mahanadhi Parisara received Writing Tools on their Pixel 8 Pro, running the latest Gboard v15.9.1 beta release.",
