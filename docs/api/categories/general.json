    "body": "In July this year, Phil Spencer said Microsoft's gaming business has \"never looked stronger\" as he simultaneously announced an absolutely brutal round of layoffs . Several studios were closed outright, games were cancelled, and almost everything in Microsoft's portfolio was touched in some way, with the aftershocks still coming . One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

One Founders Edition BIOS and a modified Nvidia driver later, and Substantial-Mark-959 says they've been able to get the card up and running. The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card. Got my hands on a engineering GTX 2080ti. from r/nvidia For reference, the release version of the RTX 2080 Ti has 4352 shaders, 88 ROPs, and 272 TMUs. That'd make this particular sample slightly quicker in theory, especially as it has a 384 bit bus width compared to the standard card's 352-bit version. With the cooler removed, the chip itself looks a lot like the stock TU102 die—although as another eagle-eyed redditor has noticed, it doesn't have any markings showing the model designation.

    "body": "Switching to an open world, Borderlands 4 is massive and packed full of sidequests and activities to complete, though these generally don't give you tons of experience to level up. Completing it all once is all well and good, but you won't want to trudge through every single quest again on an alternate character. That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

The Zenaim Arcade Controller Button Module Kit (via PC Watch ) is set to launch in Japan on September 25 for 29,700 yen which, according to Google's currency conversion, works out to $202 at the time of writing. Not cheap, then, but I bet if you're in the market for something like this, you wouldn't have been expecting something particularly cheap anyway. It includes buttons, a circuit board, and cables (or 'harnesses', according to machine translation) to connect the two. So it's not exactly a hot swappable affair, more of a 'replace all the internals of your fight stick chassis' kind of deal. Going by Google's machine translation, the company explains: \"While controllers with rapid trigger functionality have existed on the market until now, the only option was to purchase a fully assembled product, and there were no products that met the growing demand for custo…",

While some are easy enough to track down, others are a right pain and will have you searching every nook and cranny—even once you've unlocked the hint by completing nearby silos. Below, I'll go over where to find each of the vault key fragments and their respective vaults. Since unlocking the silos isn't actually required to find the fragment they point towards, I'll cut to the chase for you (aside from the few cases where it's easier to reach the fragment using the silos' lift). Fadefields vault and fragment locations The Fadefield is the first area you'll have access to on Kairos, and it's a good idea to unlock its vault early on.

Loadout experimentation has always been the name of the game, which means regular pit stops to rifle through my backpack and decide what'll get added to my arsenal and what'll fund my future respawns. For a game that is so reliant on routine inventory management, Borderlands 4 has somehow managed to massively cock it up. To the point I'm confused how we're several games deep and yet this is easily Gearbox's worst attempt to date. This is coming from someone who isn't even massively fussy when it comes to clean inventory management. I just want two things: make it quick, and make it easy. Borderlands 4 does neither. Opening up the backpack greets me with a muddled array of items, which the game defaults to sorting by manufacturer. Naturally. Who doesn't want to organise their inventory by manufacturer? Organising by recently picked up, item value, or level? Psh, who would ever need such pointless options? If I do dare to veer off the game's default selection, it only lasts until I tab over to a different screen. If I accidentally turn to a different page i…",

Essentially, it's a custom designed, 3D-printed ball of various mouth shapes, mounted inside a doll's head and spun in various configurations so only one mouth is visible through the gaping maw in the front at any one time.

Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been.

In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what.

It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

    "body": "Borderlands 4 introduces a bunch of new movement options that you can use in combat, like a glide pack, dash, and, of course, a grappling hook—all games need one, apparently. These are all great additions, and I know I'll miss them the next time I replay Borderlands 2 or 3 again. Plus, if you've made it to any of the main bosses or final encounters in any of the vaults, you'll know just how much you'll have to use these in combat, especially the grapple. The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it? Head into the accessibility settings and disable ' grapple view tilt '. This'll stop control from being ripped out of your hands, letting you grapple so long as you can see the hook in your peripheral vision without automatically pulling your camera in another direction. Given how clunky the grapple tilt is, I'm actually baffled it's enabled by…",

No Link : Steam If the \"What Is This Thing?\" subreddit existed in the Edwardian era, it'd be a quiet little curio shop called Strange Antiquities. As a temp shopkeeper filling in for the local thaumaturge, I sit behind a desk and spend my rainy days puzzling over bizarre artifacts to determine what they are and what they do. A glass bottle containing a single glowing strand of hair suspended in blue liquid. An iron claw clutching black gemstone covered in blood-red streaks. Grotesque wooden figurines, several items that appear to be severed hands, a silver pendant with a green eyeball in the center that rolls to follow my every movement. What are these things? Fans of Bad Viking's first shopkeeping puzzle adventure, Strange Horticulture, will feel right at home in the gloomy yet cozy occult shop solving the little mysteries surrounding each artifact, dozens and dozens of them, over the course of about 12 hours.

This will introduce a brand new character, and an entirely new realm to the game containing all sorts of critters, crafting materials, and quests. With significant updates like this, it's always best to set aside some time to make sure your island is ready and your pockets are stuffed with any items you might need while exploring a new land. Preparing for the release of Wheatflour Wonderland will also prevent any unnecessary obstacles getting in the way of your budding friendship with Cogimyun, the game's newest character. Since friendship progression is limited to how much you can craft per day, anyone looking to blast through the new set of friendship quests will want to give themselves a headstart. Here's what I'd advise you to do. How to prepare for the Hello Kitty Island Adventure DLC We haven't been warned of any preparation ahead of the DLC's launch, so I imagine there's nothing we need to do ahead of time.

    "body": "I remember my first gaming laptop—bought well over ten years ago now—with a somewhat complicated affection. On the one hand, I dropped 800 or so quid on it and it carried on chugging for a decade. On the other hand, it really kept me on my toes throughout the back half of its lifespan. Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop .
