Is it premature for Samsung to start packing its bags and admitting defeat to OnePlus? Realistically, yes. However, after the past week of news we’ve had regarding the OnePlus 15 and Galaxy S26 series, it’s hard to see the outcome being any different. The more we learn about the OnePlus 15, the more it seems like OnePlus is crafting one of 2026’s best Android phones. And the more we hear about the Galaxy S26, the more it sounds like Samsung is heading in the exact opposite direction.",

Samsung is prepping for a significant step-up for its smartphones’ interface with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Ahead of the purported beta rollout starting late next month, we’ve already encountered nearly a dozen noticeable changes that could come to eligible Samsung phones and tablets with the update, including iOS-like summarization for notifications using AI . And now, we’re learning about another potential notification upgrade. With One UI 8.5, Samsung may let you assign a higher priority to specific notifications, based on the feature added to a recently leaked One UI 8.5 build. As spotted by Sammyguru , the “Prioritize notification” option could be toggled on to set certain notifications as important.",

The app fails to launch because it can’t find a font that’s only provided through Google Play Services. Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up. We’ve since learned why that dependency exists, and the reason is surprisingly trivial.",

Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

    "summary": "It's $1,800 for the headset, but the accessories add another $500. What's your view on the price?",
    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Scrolling can be resumed at any time, and Shorts will still appear throughout the app while the main feed is paused. This timer is rolling out beginning today, but you may not have it just yet. Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

Several users report that their phones have changed from orange to a rose gold hue, possibly due to solvent use or UV exposure. Apple has quietly replaced affected units. Official response is still pending. The iPhone 17 series is one of Apple’s most successful releases in recent times. Despite the phones being available for over a month now, many models are still routinely out of stock, indicating continued strong demand. Case in point, the new Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max still has a shipping wait time of one to three weeks, depending on the storage variant.

    "body": "I jumped on the Apple Intelligence train pretty quickly. I mean, can you blame me? I just wanted to see if Apple had any chance of catching up to Google. It seemed — at least at first — as if Apple was readying its own version of just about everything Gemini could do, too. Apple announced plans for an image generator, photo editing tools, the ability to write and rewrite messages, and more, and it was all coming… eventually. Well, now it’s been here for about a year, and I’ve been using it nearly the entire time. I’ve tried the whole range of Apple Intelligence features multiple times across several iOS updates, and I’m still underwhelmed. I’ll be sticking with Gemini for the foreseeable future, and here’s why.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Wallet now lets you add new cards far more quickly and easily. In addition to previous options for entering card details manually or taking an image for the card, you can now tap any card that supports contactless payments to add it to Wallet. Google is also testing Material 3 Expressive elements in Wallet, but a complete redesign has yet to roll out. Despite its far-reaching applications, such as storing access passes and tickets for events and your travels, Google Wallet’s identity is incomplete without payments. Google lets you add your credit and debit cards, which can be used for quick contactless payments, but the process to add them takes a few steps. Thankfully, that is being fixed now with the latest update. Google Wallet is simplifying the mechanism for adding new debit or credit cards to your collection. Although the process previously required you to either enter the details manually or capture an image of the digits, cards that support contactless payments can now be added instantly by tapping on the area around the NFC reader on your phone.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google has added an audio source toggle to the Pixel line’s Connected Cameras feature. This means you can choose whether switching to a remote camera will also switch audio sources. This is great news, as we previously criticized this limitation after trying Connected Cameras earlier this year. Google revealed the Connected Cameras feature for Pixel phones earlier this year. This allows Pixel owners to use another Pixel or GoPro as an extra camera during live streams for more camera angles. There was one annoying audio limitation, though, but Google has finally addressed this. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

That would be a little cheaper than the launch price for the 512GB OnePlus 13 in the region. There’s no word on pricing for the base OnePlus 15 model, though. This news is covered in the video above starting at 06:40. We’ve already seen a host of OnePlus 15 leaks ahead of its Chinese launch next week, while OnePlus itself has also confirmed a few specs and features.

After all of this time, it’s hard to believe that Samsung first began teasing its extended reality (XR) headset — Galaxy XR — in early 2023.
