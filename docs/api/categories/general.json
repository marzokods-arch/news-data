    "body": "When Telltale Games came to a messy end , it seemed like the end of the line for that particular style of episodic modern choice-and-consequence adventure game. In retrospect, Life is Strange looked like a blip, a one-hit wonder whose success wasn't repeated by any of its spin-offs or follow-ups. No amount of editorials about why Telltale mattered could bring those games back. Which is why it's a pleasant surprise to see that Dispatch has done so well. Its developer, Adhoc Studio, just posted that it's sold over a million copies in 10 days , and it's not even done yet, with the final two episodes of its six-episode run due out on Wednesday at 9 am PST. Adhoc was founded by ex-Telltale staff , and includes writer Pierre Shorette, whose credits are basically a Telltale best-of list that includes Tales from the Borderlands, The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Telltale Series. Dispatch feels like an evolution of those games rather than a rehash of the formula, though—a superhero workplace comedy about the poor schmuck deciding who gets sent to to negotiate a hostage release and who gets sent to fetch a cat in a tree, it incorporates a management sim minigame where you…",

S. Anderson since the late 2000s when he'd become a fan of the series. And the particular point he got into the wonderful world of Monster Hunting seems to have had a huge influence on the movie's slightly odd setup, whereby the focus is on a US / UN military team that gets sucked into the world of Monster Hunter and oo-rahs through various encounters (with limited success). A lot of folk didn't like this side of it, but it turns out I'm a sucker for watching a Rathalos fight a tank.

No Steam Deck: Verified Link: Official site This is just The Seance of Blake Manor's way of saying hello before leaving me trapped inside a remote Irish hotel with a bunch of weirdos and would-be murderers a few days before Halloween. I'm here to solve the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, a woman the hotel manager insists isn't missing at all and most of the guests have a strong, and often not particularly positive, opinion of. To do this I've got to cautiously listen at doors before sneaking inside using stolen keys, eavesdrop on conversations held in quiet corners, and piece this puzzle together using clues found amongst crumpled up letters, half-burnt notes, and polite conversations at dinner. This is classic murder mystery stuff—and also where adventure games can quickly lose grip of their own plot. But The Seance of Blake Man…",

'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Dwarves, meanwhile, received new toys to stem the tide of besieging goblins, like autocrossbow turret emplacements and metal-fortified walls. Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration. And not just any dwarves: The moms were refusing to eat, and their babies were the culprit. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) The problem, you see, is that moms are like horses—in Dwarf Fortress, at least. In DF, mothers always hold their newborn babies until the infants reach an age where they can walk, play, and feed themselves. To achieve that, the game actually uses the same systems that let soldiers ride war mounts: While we're shown a dwarven mo…",

Titled 'The State of PC Game Distribution' (via GamesIndustry ), the paper concludes that 72% of game developers believe the platform has a monopoly on the PC games market. The whitepaper was published by the digital distribution platform Rokky . If you're wondering \"who the heck is Rokky?\" then it's a new distribution platform that aims to connect publishers with various digital storefronts around the globe.

While the changes vary slightly between civs, the general thrust is the same. \"The majority of these adjustments are significant buffs aimed at strengthening these fan-favourite Civs,\" Beach explains. \"We're also introducing more specific bonuses to help each Civ lean into a unique playstyle.\" One example is that Egypt now receives \"tailored\" bonuses for building settlements and districts alongside river tiles.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library.

This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches.

The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words.

The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet.

But what is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history? That's an interesting question, and one that when asked by Apogee Entertainment's X account, was answered by none other than the grandfather of FPS games, John Romero, he of Doom fame. Super Shotgun. https://t.co/TikpaEHwhr November 3, 2025 Romero's response was the objectively correct one in my opinion, too, with Romero voting for the 'Super Shotgun', as introduced to gaming originally in Doom 2. Many other gamers agreed with the FPS legend, with comments replying with sentiments such as, 'Agreed! Double barrel in Doom 2', as well as 'it's a scientific fact' and 'it's the Super Shotgun for me too'. One reply simply states, 'I strongly agree, Mr Romero'. How polite. Naturally, there are plenty of other suggestions for most satisfying weapon in gaming, too, ranging from Doom's Plasma …",

Even back then, when game studios were a fraction of the size of today's behemoths making Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, he wanted to work with a smaller team, where his own ideas could shine through. \"Making games, money aside, it's fun, and it needs to be fun to make something fun,\" he told me over coffee in Tokyo in late September. \"With a smaller group of people, you've got all the essential elements to make a game, and they've all got their own special abilities. One is great at art, another is great at programming. And to share the vision, it's a lot less work.\" With his John Lennon glasses and a tweed newsboy cap corralling graying sideburns, Kimura is the Platonic ideal of an elder statesman indie dev. His games from the early 2000s, including controversial survival horror Rule of Rose and kissing-based life sim Chulip , have the sort of cult appeal that inspires retrospective YouTube essays and Let's Plays.

Still your breathing and strain your ears, and you can hear, on the wind, a million people with history degrees and jobs completely unrelated to those history degrees getting incredibly excited (no shade: I'm one of them). This is Paradox's flagship grand-strategy series—its early-modern history sim that sees you guide one of a whole bunch of countries out of the late middle ages and into modernity, with almost certainly a whole lot of atrocities along the way. Our Europa Universalis 5 review is already up and, sorry to spoil you, this one sounds just as likely to suck a few hundred, or thousand, hours away from you as the last entry. \"A new bar for complexity in the historical grand strategy genre that sometimes buckles under the weight of its ambition,\" we called it.
