Pablo Alborán,&nbsp; KM0&nbsp; (Warner Music Spain) Pablo Alborán&#8217;s personal and heartfelt seventh album,&nbsp; KM0 , is a set of 14 songs and four bonus tracks in which he explores a variety of rhythms and styles. Born from the pain and uncertainty of a loved one’s illness, as the artist recounted in a recent interview with&nbsp; Billboard , the album showcases a more mature and determined musician with renewed artistic freedom. Here, Alborán takes on the songwriting of all the songs and, for the first time, produces and arranges most of them, experimenting with rhythms like country/folk (“Vámonos de Aquí,” with Indiara Sfair), salsa music (“La Vida Que Nos Espera”) and merengue (“Si Te Quedas”). The album opens with “Clickbait,” a pop track that critiques the superficiality and fake news of social media, addressing the obsession with fame and &#8220;likes.&#8221; And continues with the emotional title track, “KM0,” in which he sings about facing a new start after going through a very difficult p…",
