Earlier this week, DHS posted an image from Microsoft's Halo game series , emblazoned with the words \"Fight the Flood,\" a reference to the ongoing anti-immigration efforts being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across the US. Dehumanizing people by equating them to a parasitic alien life form is overtly grotesque, yes, but the message also invoked a more mundane question: Did DHS have Microsoft's permission to use the image in its message? (Image credit: Homeland Security (Twitter)) Microsoft—one of the many corporate donors supporting the construction of the ballroom that will replace the now-demolished White House East Wing—refused to comment on the use of one of its most popular games in a dangerously racist message.

Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

So they did! \"The two of them came in with their visual effects guy, and effectively they said to Kojima, 'We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?' Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, 'No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.\" This came as news to Hideo Kojima despite his supposed presence in the room at the time.

It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

One group, the Displaced, want to further expand their camp to solve the overcrowding problem and the tensions it's causing, while the Order, a group of predictive scientists and the residents of Matriarch's Mercy, determine that a disaster will occur if they do. In typical RPG fashion, you, a stranger who wandered into the camp, become a mediator who decides the fate of everyone. Here's what each choice entails. Should you side with the Order or the Displaced in The Outer Worlds 2? There are three potential choices you can make (Image credit: Obsidian) After you've been through all of your evidence with the Voice of the Displaced and Administrant Agarwal, you'll be asked to choose whether the Exclusion Zone should be turned into an expansion to the refugee settlement like the Displaced want, or whether it should remain excluded, which is what the Order desires.

Whilst pursuing Seer Wiley and his Order fanatics through the twisting corridors of Alexandra Monastery, you'll come face-to-face with an elaborate and sadistic quandary the seer has prepared for you. On the one hand, you can save the hostages by completing an elaborate puzzle, but it'll give Wiley more time to accomplish his objectives. On the other hand, you can leave the hostages to their fate—getting squished by a pneumatic press—but you'll reach Wiley faster and might be able to throw a spanner in his schemes. I explain both outcomes below and what the consequences are, but I also run through how to complete the hostage puzzle, including a little video of me doing it in-game.

Even though it doesn't always feel the best during combat and the animations aren't super smooth, it fulfils that all-important RPG staple of letting you admire how cool your character looks as you run around the world. Here's how to enter a third-person view in The Outer Worlds 2 for yourself.

Options to purchase the game are gone, the recent reviews are an angry chorus of fans blindsided by Amazon's decision to kill the game, and even the screenshots have vanished. In their place is a single, static image informing onlookers that content updates are done. You can compare the page's glow-down yourself. On the Wayback Machine , a version of the New World Steam page from October 7 features 14 screenshots, three trailers, and 'Mostly Positive' recent reviews, plus options to purchase either the game's standard or deluxe edition. It's now all gone. Which is more than a little odd, since Amazon explicitly said yesterday that the MMO would remain available for purchase \"on all platforms until further notice.\" Canny readers may note that Steam is a platform, and that no notice was given that the game was being removed from it.

What if I told you there's a way to get around this in the Battlefield 6 battle royale Redsec, if only you show some restraint? It's only explained in a loading screen or in-game tip (if you haven't turned those off) that you can melee downed enemies to perform a shakedown . This will play a short takedown animation that will reveal the positions of any remaining squadmates, whether it's one lone straggler or three of them.

He says the dread phrase that I truly thought we'd heard the last unironic use of at least a full decade ago. \"We haven't even had our Citizen Kane yet, let alone, you know, Jurassic Park or Star Wars.\" It's disturbingly possible that some people reading this might be too young to remember the videogame discourse of the late 2000s, but it was a time when the industry as a whole—and especially a lot of game players themselves—were seized by a kind of paralysing inferiority complex.

    "body": "Twitch already has plenty of vtubers streaming on it daily, some of whom are incredibly successful . But it doesn't have hololive, the biggest group of vtubers in the world. A few of its members have streamed on it here and there in the past, but now it's going to be a regular spot to watch the most popular anime girls play games. COVER, owner of the hololive vtuber agency, has entered a partnership with Twitch for its talents to regularly stream on the platform. If you've ever seen a clip of an anime dog girl or a shark girl playing a game, it was probably a hololive vtuber. One of its most popular English-speaking vtubers, Calliope Mori, has over 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and several of its Japanese talents have even more. They won't abandon their home on YouTube, but simultaneous streams on both platforms will be more common as each vtuber makes the transition. It probably won't be long until you see hololive vtubers showing up under the most popular game categories, likely giving Twitch a significant boost in viewership. The deal is another part of COVER's expansion into the West after hololive exploded in popularity in 2020. Its vtubers are popping up everywhere, wh…",

    "body": "Days after a report from Bloomberg explained that Microsoft has expected unrealistic profit margins from its gaming division —one likely reason for its raft of studio closures, game cancelations and thousands of layoffs—a chipper Satya Nadella basically said as much out loud during an interview at a Github conference on Tuesday. \"If we as an industry don't continue to innovate how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model—the best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund,\" the Microsoft CEO said on the tech-focused talk show TBPN . It was at least the fifth time in the interview that Nadella said the word \"innovation,\" though at no point did an idea of any specificity precede or follow it. While most of the interview bounced between incomprehensible AI talk and variations on 'Microsoft's Azure servers make a shitload of money,' when it came to gaming Nadella didn't seem to have much new to say, though what he did say he said with inspiring confidence: \"Most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent, maybe, some new interactive media as well.
