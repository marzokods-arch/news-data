It's mostly a list of bug fixes, such as the \"Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava\" (thank god, that boss didn't need to be any harder) or \"Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.\" That happened to my buddy Jeff, once. One actual soft-nerf to the Cogflies does sting, a bit, with Team Cherry fixing \"Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.\" I never used these much myself, except to skip part of the painful, anti-infested gauntlet for Skarrsinger Karmalita's fight, but it definitely makes 'em weaker in exploration. They're still pretty dang good, though, particularly with a tools-only setup . The real news, however, is Team Cherry giving a timeline on fixing the game's terrible Simplified Chinese translation which (quoting Omori's Chinese language localiser Tiger Tang) reads \"like a Wuxia novel instead of conveying the game's tone\". This kerfuffle saw its Chinese reviews tanking on Steam, with Team Cherry promising to remedy the problem in short order. Well, now we've got an estimate: \"For our upcoming patches, beyond regular fixes, our first pri…",

It can take a while to figure out what Cogimyun's two and three-heart gifts are as a result. Although you won't be able to give a bad gift, as the game only lets you select items which have at least one heart, if you're desperate to level up quickly you'll want to focus on higher value items.

My sister sat screaming in fear over my shoulder while I navigated the first one, and my housemates in university happily attempted to instruct me through the second. I was fully ready for Little Nightmares 3 to be the first I actually played on my own, until the demo released and I realised it had co-op—foiled again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first of the series to feature co-op, and after just 30 minutes of crawling through Necropolis, I've come to the stark realisation that the entire series, or at least the sections where there's already an NPC companion by your side, would've greatly benefited from supporting two players. You still have the option to play with an AI companion if you'd rather go alone. If it's anything like the companion in the second game, then I'd much rather recruit a second player than watch a computer stumble around trying to get in the right position to complete a basic puzzle. Being able to turn to my partner, someone who has never p…",

    "body": "Borderlands 4 is an FPS, sure, but first and foremost it's an ARPG—with all the intersecting build shenanigans you'd come to expect. Players have already started uncovering a few of these—for instance, if you get the right knife, you can basically instagib anything. See, throwing knives can have the \"Penetrator Augment\" rolled on them, which causes all damage to be critical damage for a few seconds. Vex, in particular, can combine this with her Contamination skill, with critical hits causing 100% status chance, stacked on top of her crits already being able to cause bleeds. You bleed someone, the bleed is now critically hitting, causing more bleeds, which themselves cause more bleeds, which then—you get the idea. With such an overpowered build on the table, you might think Gearbox would be winding up to take a swing for the kneecaps with the nerf bat, but you'd be wrong. Per creative director Graeme Timmins on X , the studio will be going buffs first, nerfs later: \"We've seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife,\" Timmins writes. \"We're not going to act on those immediately, instead, we're looking at our first round of buffs.

Unlike Death Stranding or OD, it's set to embrace the \"tactical espionage action\" of Kojima's classic Metal Gear Solid series. The poster below shows the game's deliberately-shrouded protagonist. According to Kojima speaking at the event, casting of the main character was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, but he did reveal three confirmed cast members. These include Don Lee (or Ma Dong-Seok) who has appeared in Eternals and Train to Busan. Charlee Fraser, best known for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, will also star alongside Minami Hamabe, who appeared in Godzilla Minus One. Here's the poster: (Image credit: Kojima Productions) Physint will use an advanced version of the Decima Engine that powers Death Stranding, as well as Horizon Zero Dawn and others. It's further out than even OD, which itself doesn't have a release date, though Physint is expected to release within six years. \"[Physint] will be both a game and a movie at the same time,\" Kojima said in February 2024. \"Of course it will be a game.

Death Stranding Mosquito is its working title, and it's in production at ABC Animation Studio, with Hiroshi Miyamoto as director (Sonic Team, Eiga Hugtto! Precure x Futari wa Precure: All Stars Memories) and Aaron Guzikowski writing the screenplay (Prisoners, The Red Road). Hideo Kojima will produce. Look: I won't profess to know what's going on in the above trailer. There's definitely a whole lot more punching than I remember in Death Stranding. The big scary black-tentacled dog looks pretty gnarly. The animation is definitely of the premium variety: it looks gorgeous in action, and seems more impeccably detailed than the usual cross-media anime cash-in. Mosquito doesn't have a release window, and again, the title hasn't been confirmed yet. The forthcoming A24 movie adaptation of Death Stranding was also discussed during the livestream, though according to director Michael Sarnoski speaking during the event, it's not a straight adaptation per se: it'll have a story of its own, with characters that d…",

The footage shows what could be the protagonist, played by Sophia Lillis, entering a morbid-looking room, and approaching a maudlin little table with an elaborate candle display. As they start to light the candles, weird, scary stuff starts to happen. Kojima reiterated how the game will blur games and film, without going into any specifics on exactly how. Spencer's comments were similarly unhelpful: he said that OD was innovating \"in gameplay, story and player engagement\". Microsoft is offering technical support on the project. It certainly looks a lot like P.T. The sound design is deliciously oppressive, and the footage is mostly first-person. Kojima wouldn't be drawn on how far into development the game is, so that's completely up in the air for now. OD will bear the subtitle Knock, which Kojima explained has everything to do with his fear of knocking (and I think P.T. bears that out). Despite the video's focus on lighting can…",

Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses.

According to YouTuber The Phawx , the device feels \"comically light\" without the external battery, and he likes it a lot with the battery slapped on the back. He says, \"I just ultimately prefer the battery pack on at all times.\" Effectively, with the Win 5, you can either keep it plugged in all the time, or connect a battery to the back of the device via a port and locking mechanism. Think of how the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons work, with a clip letting them slide up and out. It is not, however, hot swappable, so plugging out the battery entirely shuts it down. The Phawx points out that the battery strapped onto the back covers some of the device's intake fans, though he hasn't had the chance to fully test the thermals yet. He did, however, notice the fans felt a little louder with the pack on. In exchange for this strange battery system, you get the full-fat Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, complete with 40 RDNA …",

As spotted by Hackaday , the half-hour-long video of the YouTuber making a 'portable' Xbox Original is sort of like the lovechild of a mad scientist, a teacher, and a stream of consciousness. After grabbing an Xbox that isn't working, James figures out that the DVD drive is flagging a hard drive issue, and fixes the DVD drive by replacing a tiny failing resistor with four separate, much bigger resistors, then hot-glueing them down. This is subsequently followed by smacking the top of the Xbox until the disk tray comes out. Then, after fixing the original Xbox, James takes it apart again and starts throwing the bits of plastic he doesn't need on the floor. Taking apart this plastic is important to get the central motherboard and necessary components as small as possible, and he replaces the big unwieldy hard drive with a CompactFlash drive, saving a little more space. …",

In a recent, brief chat with YouTuber HarrisonShippp , Ogg was asked how excited he was for GTA 6's release next year. \"I feel nothing inside,\" answered Ogg, definitively. And just in case you're wondering if that's a more general cry for help, he quickly made clear he was speaking specifically about GTA: \"I'm not a gamer. I've never played a videogame, so I feel absolutely nothing.\" Which, hey, fair enough. Some voice actors get super deep into their roles—like the cast of Baldur's Gate 3—and for others it's just a paycheque. Neither's an illegitimate approach, and Ogg has made clear before that he's not keen on GTA fans essentially treating him like Trevor in real life.

I don't want a combat system where I can master the timings and get into a flow state, I want it to be janky and panicked like it's simulating what it would be like for an ordinary person to be handed a plank with a nail in it and thrown in a room with a monster made of nightmares. To cut a long story short, Silent Hill F is not that kind of game. It's the kind with an involved combat system it really wants you to get to grips with. You may be playing a teenage girl in the 1960s, but by god you're going to have to master the blade. (Image credit: Konami) It's not just a matter of \"light attack, heavy attack, maybe a dodge if you ask nicely.\" In Silent Hill F you can time a heavy attack right to do a counterattack, and can spend focus to broaden the counterattack window. Stay in focus mode till a bar fills up and you can launch a s…",

My inherent distrust after years of being lied to by the internet urged caution at first, but HandowShandowed looks legit. For one, they have a library of Hollow Knight challenge videos going back years, and while they never explicitly lay out the setup they use or show real world footage of their inputs, their gameplay footage across the two Hollow Knights is synced perfectly. I suppose a TAS-style tool might be able to replicate the effect, but HandowShandowed's play has the believable messiness and flow of a human at the controls—at a certain point, this would be harder to fake than just do . Their first upload in the series on September 17 started slow, but with an impressive showing against the first boss of each game : The Moss Mother in Silksong, and the False Knight in Hollow Knight.

Once Nvidia's magic \"make it run better\" juice, DLSS and its alternative AI upscalers have become worryingly mandatory to run many of the most graphically demanding games, so why add it to Legends of the Zone, a remaster pack whose oldest game, Shadow of Chornobyl, came out all the way back in 2007? User Avdievs in the Steam discussion page for the patch points out that DLSS' texture filtering and antialiasing components can be desirable even in a game that should be easy to run⁠—and Legends of the Zone can be much more of a performance hog than the original releases. \"That DLSS is the perfect option for the ones wishing to play with their insanely taxing indirect lighting in 4k 60+ fps,\" wrote user Spleen, referring to a new graphical feature introduced with Legends of the Zone's enhanced global illumination.

It's a demo that delivers. Thrasher is a kinetic, engaging little rhythm game that boasts some excellent audio and visual design. It's a pretty classic score-chasing, time attack game where you're always trying to make more and more skillful moves with your \"magnificent space eel\" in order to hit circling motions and rack up a higher combo. The visuals are excellent in that nearly-off-putting, psychedelic way I want from this kind of game. There's a glowing space eel that evolves to get ever-larger as it flies across bizarre and sometimes mesmerizing landscapes. There's a huge baby with glowing eyes, which is a bit upsetting, but hey, look at that glowing eel. The music is, of course, great at inducing that flow state you want from a good rhythm game.

It's much more complicated than people think.\" DICE producer Jeremy Chubb noted that while players have \"really particular views\" about the original Operation Firestorm and how it should be remade, they may be disappointed if the developers don't \"evolve it and embrace the new ideas and features\" in Battlefield 6.

A good, deep D&D adventure as I imagined them to be—basically Mazes and Monsters , minus the moral panic psychosis—was out of reach. The first Baldur's Gate changed all that, with great dungeons, an epic quest, and most important of all, a deep cast of characters with their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities—and who, just like in the real world, would sometimes gel or clash with their fellows in unexpected ways. Some became fast friends, others would try to literally murder each other, and a handful would just throw their hands up in disgust at my obvious incompetence and leave, after giving me a good telling-off of course.
