What it's missing, however, is a good dose of 3D V-Cache. This has been AMD's ace up its sleeve for a while now, a stacked layer of extra L3 cache that many games love to take advantage of. We've seen its effectiveness when implemented on some of our favourite AM4 gaming processors of old, and it's also turned up in a more recent Zen 4 chip, the Ryzen 5 7600X3D, and the Zen 5-based Ryzen 7 9800X3D , our pick as the best gaming CPU overall. The trouble is, 3D V-Cache-equipped AM5 chips are usually quite pricey. Those looking for a properly sub-$300 beastie with AMD's game-crunching cache tech (the 7600X3D has an MSRP of $299, and usually retails for a lot higher than that) have traditionally had to make do with chips built for the previous-gen AM4 socket, like the Ryzen 5 5700X3D .

The project itself is based on Joel's childhood memory of a Nintendo 64 running in a store window display, and attempts to recapture the magic of that experience (via Hackaday ). There's something alluring about a game running on a CRT monitor , so they took it upon themselves to bring gaming on a small CRT display into the modern age, all in a somewhat-portable format. The donor screen came from a portable Sony TV of what looks like early 90s stock, which at the time would have been a cutting edge device. However, while the internals of the TV are relatively compact for the era, fitting them into a console-friendly frame and interfacing them with modern hardware turned out to be quite the task.

But if one former Bungie developer had got his way, Marathon wouldn't be an extraction shooter. Not because he would have made the game differently, but because he hated the term so much, he wanted to change it. Speaking on the Shooter Monthly podcast (via TheGamePost ), Bungie's former director of product management Chris Sides said that he thought about collaborating with the studio's marketing team to come up with a different term for extraction shooters, one that presumably would have been pushed in the runup to Marathon's launch. The reason for this, Sides says, is the vagueness of the term. \"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like: \"Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb.

Zen 6 \"was the first tape-out in TSMC 2 nm\", and the slide says that Zen 7 will be based on a \"future node\" at a yet-undisclosed future time. In a different presentation for the Financial Analyst Day, Jack Huynh, senior VP and GM for the Computing and Graphics Group, presents a slide laying out the APU (accelerated processing unit) roadmap, which for us is of course most relevant to handheld gaming PCs . On this front, apparently we'll be seeing 'Medusa' APUs in 2027, which will presumably mean the first big new architecture for APUs, ie, chips with powerful integrated graphics for efficient light gaming in low-power laptops and handhelds.

    "body": "Sony has announced a new \"PlayStation\" branded gaming monitor, due out in 2026 . It's a 27-inch model running at 1440p and features a swing-down charging hook for DualSense Playstation controllers. Specs wise, the information Sony has released places the new panel towards the lower end of the mid-tier in a PC gaming monitor context with an IPS panel and 240 Hz refresh rate. Though the 240 Hz is only available when hooked up to a PC. It'll run at 120 Hz connected to PlayStation consoles. Aside from the resolution, refresh rate and panel type, the rest of the speeds and feeds are unclear. Sony doesn't quote response times or brightness. Even the quoted HDR capability is awfully vague. \"High Dynamic Range support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping that automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring rich and vivid picture quality,\" is what Sony says, which could mean almost anything from very basic HDR signal support right through to full-array local dimming. That said, you might have expected Sony to make a big deal about any fancy backlight tech on offer. So, we're probably talking about the most basic entry-level HDR support for this monitor.

It sounds like the kind of thing I'd persuade myself everyone feels when in reality that's just not the case, but the love for the Coffee Talk series suggests otherwise. This set of comforting, coffee shop simulators lets you live out this fantasy, master the wizardry of latte art, all while befriending your customers and unravelling their stories along the way. However, the next chapter of the Coffee Talk series will whisk us to a much more lively location: the bustling city of Tokyo. And, as announced during the State of Play on November 11, we can expect to embark on this all-new adventure on March 5. But despite its busy setting, Coffee Talk Tokyo will still offer \"a cosy place to be\" for anyone who passes through its doors, which is bound to be a welcome relief in a virtual rendition of the most populated city in the world. If you've played either of the Coffee Talk games before, you'll know what the general routine is like, and Coffee Talk Tokyo won't be making too many changes.

And one of the studio's all-time great bosses is coming back. At the 1:15 mark in the trailer above, Artorias of the Abyss from the first Dark Souls appears as a new addition to the pool of bosses you'll have to face before one of the end-of-run Nightlords. He's not the first Dark Souls boss to apear in Nightreign: DS1's Gaping Dragon is in the game, too, as one of the easier bosses to dispatch. Something tells me Artorias will be a bit more of a challenge. That something is probably my memory of fighting Artorias in his namesake DLC for Dark Souls, Artorias of the Abyss, released in 2012. While FromSoftware's games are quite fast-paced today, demanding quick reflexes in fights against the likes of Malenia , that wasn't the case in Dark Souls.

In fact, the entire Limveil map has been transformed by a new event called The Great Hollow. \"A great cavity in the depths of Limveld,\" is how the post on the PlayStation Blog describes it. It's a big hole with a big crystal and everything down there looks terrifying. To fight the new horrors are two new characters: The Scholar and The Undertaker. The Undertaker is a strength- and faith-based character who wields a mace and has an ultimate that sends her flying up to attack enemies. The Scholar looks less mobile, but equipped with a tome he can use to lift enemies up in place. The PlayStation Blog confirms that there are two new Nightlord bosses to fight at the end of each run.

But developer Warhorse Studios isn't satisfied with making one of the best games of 2025, planning nothing less than to claim the RPG throne for themselves. Speaking at a preview event for KCD 2's upcoming Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC (via GamesRadar ) communications director Tobias Stolz-Zwilling laid out Warhorse's battle plan. \"We, at Warhorse Studios, absolutely feel at home in the RPG genre. We want to establish ourselves as the new kings of RPGs.\" As for how Warhorse intends to achieve this, Stolz-Zwilling believes the studio is already on the right track, in the way KCD 2 blends detailed quest design with a reactive, open-ended world that recalls the emergent delights of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion . This, Stolz-Zwilling says, will carry through into whatever Warhorse makes next: \"We believe that we have our own formula here, and that we define them in a specific way, and our next project will go the same direction. It will definitely be immersive RPGs.\" Needless to say, Warhorse has some stiff competition. Curren…",

It's set in a walled corporate city in the aftermath of a mysterious cataclysm. Teen protagonist Luca loses her legs during the calamity and is left for dead, but fortunately it's not long before she's possessed by a demon called Rhem, who grants her some new insectile legs on the proviso they collaborate on an escape from the ruined city. As far as pacts with the devil go, it's pretty rational. The 20-odd hour metroidvania that ensues has a lot to admire about it, but doesn't buck nor create any trends. Before the fall, the corporate doyens of this walled city, Agradyne, siphoned a resource called Chroma from captured demons, which was used to power the batteries they sold.

Aerie was a formerly-winged elf who worked in a circus and had a great deal of personal trauma, which she worked out over the course of an extended courtship with you, the male player character. At some point, she would get pregnant, and the resulting child—named, in the blunt language of early CRPGs, \" Aerie's Baby \"—would hold eternal tenure in your already-limited inventory, in a space you might otherwise put a bundle of arrows or a longsword. This is a sequence of events which I now regard as having ruined all of videogames. (Image credit: BioWare) To be fair to poor, pinioned Aerie, she was not the only option in the game's ragbag of sweethearts, but she is the one that sticks in my memory, mostly because of the storage baby. But the shape of BG2's romances is the shape of so many RPG romances since. Swap out Aerie for Liara, Viconia for Lae'zel, Anomen for Alistair—decades later and we're still wooing the same hotties by different names. It does not work for me.

The bad news is that Sedletz Monastery has gone into lockdown, its monks into seclusion, and the abbot has ordered you to stay put in the infirmary, and absolutely not go sneaking about investigating the source of the plague. But sneaking about you will go if you want to grab the necessary materials for the plague mask, so make sure to avoid guards and save often. If one does spot you, either try to sprint into a safe, non-private area, or simply ask them to take you back to the infirmary by replying.
