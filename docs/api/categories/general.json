    "body": "Morgan Wallen ’s I&#8217;m the Problem leads Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart (dated Nov. 8) for the 24th consecutive week. This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 210, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black arti…",

So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025.

After all the drama around the Galaxy S26 Edge , we’re back to the usual three Galaxy S series flagships, but now on a delayed timeline as the company scrambles to get the Galaxy S26 Plus going on time. Leaks suggest that Samsung will hold its Unpacked event in San Francisco on February 25, 2026 .

The high price understandably results in consumer frustration when major channels disappear from YouTube TV during negotiations — something that has already happened multiple times in 2025. This time, YouTube TV fans are noticing that all Disney content is unavailable as of October 30 , when their contract expired. A whopping 21 channels immediately disappeared from the platform, including big names like ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic. You might not know that most of your favorite channels are consolidated under just a few media companies.

Google’s keenly aware of that: It offers a version of the YouTube app that’s explicitly made for children’s content in YouTube Kids, and earlier this year, rolled out a controversial AI-based age estimation system to automatically flag accounts that may be used by minors. These measures are meant in part to help Google avoid legal trouble — like a 2019 class-action suit filed in California accusing Google and YouTube of violating privacy laws by collecting information about minors for the purposes of advertising. The suit was eventually settled for a sum of $30 million, and now, according to Top Class Actions , affected users are able to submit claims to get a cut of that settlement.",

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

The list includes several channels under ABC, ESPN, and Nat Geo labels, in addition to Disney’s. YouTube says it will refund subscribers $20 if the channels are off the network for too long. YouTube TV is already among the most expensive live digital TV services on offer in the US. And it’s about to pinch its subscribers a little more as it has failed to renew its deal with Disney. Following a public spat from last week , when YouTube accused Disney of arm-twisting it, the two parties have failed to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. With this, more than 20 channels from Disney’s network, including multiple ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic channels, have been removed from the live TV platform.",

The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S .

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.
