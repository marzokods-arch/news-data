A good action RPG needs exciting items to chase and Blizzard has finally cracked how to do that in a game with piles and piles of loot. I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

Sadly, it was not to be, and just five months after its 1.0 release, developer Theorycraft Games is pulling the plug. \"While the game has been out to the public for a little over a year, many of you have been playing with us for longer during our open prototyping phase,\" the studio explained in an FAQ . \"We're proud of the game that we built together, but ultimately we've been unable to capture the attention and excitement of enough players to sustain further development.\" In a video accompanying the closure announcement, Supervive executive producer Jenn Nam said \"a huge number\" of players had tried Supervive, but most of them stopped playing after a short time with it. That's left just a handful of die-hards still playing—currently a little over 200, according to SteamDB—which isn't enough to justify the expense of keeping Supervive running. That reaction …",

After that Unrecord went underground, as the two-man team began work on turning what was then a prototype into a full game.

It's also, says Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima, a sign of the times. \"This game is serious about taking players seriously,\" he told me in a recent chat, \"and I think we can see in the game industry in general, there is a [tendency] towards the games that offer this, kind of, more grown-up approach and offer less hand-holding.

With Xbox Game Pass, I can take my game collection everywhere I go this season—here are six games I'll be spending the holidays with. Fallout 4 (Image credit: Bethesda Softworks) I devoured every episode of the Fallout TV series when it came out. After it wrapped up, all I wanted to do was head back into the Wasteland and explore to the dulcet sounds of The Ink Spots. Set in an irradiated Boston, you'll build settlements, kill Deathclaws, and befriend a cast of compelling companions, like our synth buddy Nick Valentine. To me, all of that is secondary to wandering the vast open world, discovering secrets and creatively placed skeletons. Fallout 4 might be 10 years old, but it's still a multi-award-winning game that puts you in an immense and varied world. As we said in our review , \"It'…",

The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware.

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",

Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.)

Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things.

This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs.

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024.
