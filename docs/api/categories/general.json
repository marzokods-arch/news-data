Patch 7.4 hit Final Fantasy 14 earlier this week, bringing a conclusion to the excellent Arcadion raids. Not only have all 12 fights been an absolute joy to play, but the series has some of the strongest identity and cast of characters the game has seen in a good long while. That's thanks in no small part to each fighter having a unique theme song—something that is not afforded to every raid in this game—and I firmly believe the Arcadion series simply would not have hit the same without Soken's excellent and varied musical work on it. A world where I didn't have Bee My Honey permanently stuck in my head? That's a world I don't wanna live in. So tell me why, then, Final Fantasy 14, did you STILL manage to cram Machinations into one of the goddamn cutscenes?

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . It's funny, but I didn't even enjoy Elden Ring Nightreign at first. Like most FromSoftware fans, I was resistant to the concept of an Elden Ring spinoff you're supposed to play almost entirely in multiplayer. I also recognised its obvious limitations. Despite being a roguelike all about team interplay, as you use your limited time to accrue as much power and pertinent passives as possible while journeying to battle the Nightlord, one thing stuck out to me: It doesn't have comms. Unless you're playing with friends through Discord, you have to limit your interactions to tagging. Predictably, this leads to endless frustrations and horror stories about incompetent teammates, plenty of which you can find if you peruse the game's subreddit. It's an important flaw to recognise, because if I didn't have two other FromSoftware-fanatic friends with which to play Nightreign, I would've quit. As you can see from all…",

But Straftat is also one of the best shooters of 2025, too, thanks to the immense amount of support the Lemaitre brothers have poured into, essentially doubling the map count since launch. Now, one half of Straftat's developers, Léonard Lemaitre, has announced a new game called Vholume , a Mirror's Edge style first-person platformer set in a vast, dystopian city. While Straftat is the easier reference here, Vholume arguably has more in common with Babbdi , which shares the brutalist aesthetic of both Straftat and Vholume. But was a moody single-player exploration game rather than a frantic multiplayer shooter. Vholume seems to be a solo experience too, but one that boasts a far more elaborate movement system than Babbdi.

Despite this legacy, Arkane Austin's story came to an end just a year after Redfall's launch. Recently, the studio's former director Harvey Smith discussed these events and how they affected the team on the My Perfect Console podcast (via Kotaku ). \"I got a call the night before and spent a very stressful night thinking about that, every company makes the decisions they make for the reasons they make them.

The first Brutalist Jam occurred in 2022, spawning 35 maps that were bundled together and released as a single mod. A second Brutalist Jam took place the following year, producing 30 more delightfully grey, angular constructions to blast your way through. Both Jams seemed like impressive achievements at the time. But this year's Brutalist Jam blows both previous events out of the water. After kicking off in October, the Quake Brutalist Jam 3 has received a whopping 75 entries created by the Quake community. For context, the original version of Quake contains 37 maps. Why has this Jam proved so much more popular than the previous ones? Well, it might be partly down to word of mouth spreading, and the Jam didn't run last year, which likely encouraged people who feared they missed out to take part this year. But on top of that, Quake Brutalist Jam 3 doesn't just use vanilla Quake as its foundation…",

Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (Image credit: Ubisoft) Developer: Arkane Year: 2006 I've praised Dark Messiah's open sandboxes designed for brawling in before , but its linear sections are great as well. Early on there's one where you're hurled into a town as it's besieged by the undead, running through collapsing buildings until you can get to a ballista and shoot a shambling zombie cyclops. The next one happens when the magic crystal you're in town to deliver gets stolen right in front of you by a ghoul, and you have to chase it across rooftops in the darkness and rain. To keep up you jump across gaps, clamber up chains, squeeze through windows, and don't fall to your death as timbers creak and collapse beneath you. It's like the chase from Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth only in reverse, because here you're pursuing rather than being pursued and also you've got a snowflake's chance of getting it right first go. The glowing crystal leaves a trail of energy that draws the eye, and you've got a succubus in your head who gives advice like a cacodemon Cortana. Most of the time…",

Now, developer Nuggets Entertainment has released the first major update to RV There Yet? sim since launch, which adds a whole new map for players to drive their knockoff Winnebago across. The map is set on and around the fictional slopes of Mt Yurbuttsk, a frigid jumble of ice and rock that your chain-smoking holidaymakers must pass through on their quest to find Route 65. Nuggets gets straight to the point when listing the update's features, with a recent Steam post revealing the map includes new animals, items, tools and \"snowball fights\", as well as a new narrative to thread the whole thing together.

    "body": "Minimal effort, cinema-grade projection. That's what Dangbei's new addition to the DBOX02 lineup is offering. DBOX02 Pro is a 4K gaming projector that wants to take over your living room with thumping speakers, immense projection size, and a wildly adaptable auto keystone. It's an attempt to replace your TV and your Hi-Fi system with something altogether compact and stylish, that won't falter when the sun comes shining in. While there are plenty of TV replacement projectors out there vying for that spot in your home entertainment system, few have the chops to nail gaming too. That's where the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro comes in. Smooth and shiny on the front, this mostly matt black cube features subtly rounded edges and a lightly curved facade. It's a modern aesthetic that proudly flaunts a touch of those lovable retro vibes, without being smothered in buttons and dust-catching greebles. The projector itself sits atop a seamless stand that grips it on either side. It allows for a 360 degrees rotation and 120 degree tilt for ceiling projection. There's none of that twisting the little feet to get the perfect angle, either, since the DBOX02 Pro comes with an impeccable InstanPro AI auto key…",

Fortunately, Death Howl hasn’t been made by evil money men, but slightly-less evil developers who clearly understand what makes good deckbuilders and soulslikes tick. Even if they’re slightly too infatuated with a difficulty curve they purchased from the rectangle factory. I thought all deckbuilders had to be roguelikes by law, so it’s paradoxically a little refreshing to play one that follows a more traditional game structure.

Trendforce recently shared its findings that OLED monitor shipments grew 65% from this period last year, and 12% from the previous quarter. With a total estimated shipment of 2.62 million in the third quarter of 2025, this means that OLED monitor shipments have grown by 84% year-on-year. Trendforce also lays out which companies these orders are from. Asus sits at the very top of the pile, enjoying a 21.9% share. You can see the full stats below. Company Market Share Asus 21.9% Samsung 18% MSI 14.4% LG Electronics 12.9% Others 32.7% Naturally, shipping figures and total sales are different metrics, though they are linked. As items sell better, stores will naturally stock more. It's also worth noting that Trendforce's analysis encompasses all OLED monitors, not just OLED gaming monitors. For example, Asus has a whole range of ProArt OLED productivity monitors, which definitely helps that market share. Trendforce's report from last year put OLED monitor shipments at 1.44 million units, growing by 181% compared to the previous year. So, while th…",

In a chat with Bad Company 2's lead designer, David Goldfarb, he says that he thinks the team would \"want to do it\", but after all these years they're now spread across the industry—including at Embark, the studio behind Arc Raiders. \"So there's that part of it, where that band's not getting back together to make that game. But another band could make it.\" But that would require Battlefield Studios—made up of DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion and Motive—and EA itself to take a massive risk, something the publisher isn't exactly famous for doing. \"If they choose to make it, they are choosing, in their own minds, to make a product that is going to have a smaller subset of buyers,\" says Goldfarb, \"just by virtue of the fact that humour is subjective.

However, it's now being used as an unlikely piece of evidence in another bizarre tale of alleged corporate espionage. Amazon began to suspect something was amiss when it looked at the keystroke data from a new IT hire. To the company's knowledge, the employee was US-based so there should have been a comfortably less than 100 millisecond delay between them typing commands on their corporate laptop, and those inputs reaching the head office in Seattle. However, the delay was in fact 110 milliseconds, suggesting the employee was based further afield than first thought. Amazon’s Chief Security Officer Stephen Schmidt communicated to Bloomberg a bizarre bigger picture. It turns out the employee with the lag was in fact a North Korean attempting to skirt international sanctions and funnel money back into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (or DPRK) via remote work. After a few days of investigation and monitoring, they were ousted from Amazon's systems. According to Schmidt, the company has thwart…",

Normally the preserve of big tech events like CES and Computex, AMD has decided to buck that trend and quietly launch a new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics card. Its unique selling point? A marginally lower power limit. There was no announcement behind the launch whatsoever, as AMD just dropped the new card into its product pages , alongside its other Radeon models (via BenchLife ). Simply labelled as the Radeon RX 9060 XT LP, it's literally just a normal 16 GB RX 9060 XT that's had its 160 W power limit reduced to 140 W. The product page doesn't mention any changes to clock speeds, but these have been lowered, too, as this can be inferred from AMD's listed theoretical performance figures. For example, where the standard RX 9060 XT has an FP32 vector rate of 25.6 TFLOPS, the LP version is stated as being 25 TFOPS. Going through all the metrics, the RX 9060 XT LP has clock speeds that are between 2 and 3% lower than the standard XT's, so instead of a boost clock of up to 3130 MHz, you're looking at 3050 MHz.

It's been a decade since both were officially released, but while Windows 10 has been shuffled off into the realms of 'end of life' support, DirectX 12 has grown to become the most comprehensive collection of graphics APIs ever created. To celebrate this fact, Microsoft has published a short blog detailing some of the major improvements and upgrades that DirectX 12 has enjoyed over the years. For some folks, especially those who have been involved with PCs for as long as I have, it will only seem like yesterday when the new API was let loose. However, ten years is a long time in PC gaming. For example, back in 2015, Intel's four-core i7 6700K was the best gaming CPU you could buy. Since then, however, not only has Intel released nine further generations of chips, with the most recent sporting up to 24 cores, but the processor of choice for discerning gamers has switched to being an AMD one.
