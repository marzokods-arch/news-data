We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

    "summary": "You could be under two weeks away from your Galaxy phone getting its first taste of One UI 8.5.",
    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s been testing One UI 8.5 internally, but has yet to get a public beta underway. Multiple sources now suggest that Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta could formally launch on December 8. Following that, we could also get Beta 2 in late December, and Beta 3 in early January. By this point, it’s got to be pretty frustrating being a Samsung Galaxy user who keeps hearing about all the great stuff being implemented in One UI 8.5 — and yet you still don’t have the chance to try any of it out. We’ve been tracking information gleaned from One UI 8.5 leaks going back months now, but the manufacturer has yet to get the ball rolling on a public beta. We just learned that a Galaxy S25 build of One UI 8.5 had surfaced on a test server, making it look like Samsung might get started soon, and now some new rumors attempt to nail down exactly when. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Amazon If your laptop is running out of ports or you’re juggling cables every time you sit down, this Black Friday discount on the highly rated Anker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub might solve a lot of small annoyances at once. It’s down to just $29.99 from $39.99 in the sale, and we’ve never seen it cheaper. Despite the compact size, you get a proper mix of ports here: 4K@30Hz HDMI for an external monitor , three 5Gbps data ports (one USB-C and two USB-A), an SD card slot, Ethernet, and a USB-C input for power. The pass-through charging supports up to 85W, which is enough to keep most modern ultrabooks topped up while everything else stays connected.",
