Swift dropped four new CD variants of her latest album, each featuring two acoustic tracks not found on the standard version of Showgirl . Now available in &#8220;limited quantities&#8221; on Swift&#8217;s official webstore , the CDs are described as having &#8220;brand new production by Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift and newly recorded vocals by Taylor Swift.&#8221; Fans can order the the limited-release CDs over a 24-hour period, through 7 p.m. ET Sunday &#8212; &#8220;while supplies last.&#8221; Each CD is priced at $7.99, and features cover art that&#8217;s different from that on the standard release. (Those who made it to a screening of The Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters this weekend will recognize the imagery.) &#8220;File this under &#8216;save your best for the finale&#8217;… I think my favorite moments from the tour were the acoustic surprises.

    "body": "Taylor Swift ’s The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift&#8217;s biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele’s 25 , which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2&nbsp;million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department , sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Luminate’s sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard ’s charts. All numbers in this story are for the U.S. only.
