At the end of a lengthy tell-all video about Anthem's legendarily troubled development (via Eurogamer ), former BioWare executive producer and Anthem project lead Mark Darrah indicated that the tech for running Anthem locally once existed—and could, theoretically, exist again. It would, however, rely on either third-party ingenuity or uncharacteristic generosity from EA. I'll let you decide which is more likely. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) Anthem's live service network design had a client-server structure: To play, you and every other player would've had to connect to servers that handled the game's logic. Your PC didn't have to do the thinking. It just had to handle the results and make them look pretty. According to Darrah, however, Anthem actually had code for running locally—meaning players' own machines would host network sessions that other players could connect to—until very late in development. \"Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months be…",

Giving a quick glance at some side-by-side screenshots it would be pretty easy to confuse the two, though that's not a huge surprise: Hypixel Studio, maker of Hytale, was founded by Minecraft modders and mappers who decided to create their own voxel game. Besides looks, Minecraft and Hytale have a ton in common: they both take place in \"infinite\" procedurally generated worlds with multiple biomes and deformable terrain, they both feature base-building and gear and weapon crafting, cooking, wildlife and fantasy monsters, and other similar systems. They can both be played solo or in co-op, they both have creative modes, and they're both moddable. And there's blocks. So many, many blocks. So… what's the actual difference between them? Why should you consider trying Hytale if you've already got Minecraft? 1.

In response, Hytale posted a salute emoji and wrote, \"Thank you for helping bring Hytale home.\" (Image credit: Riot Games (Twitter)) It's a small, low-key exchange, but notable nonetheless for one very obvious reason: Riot acquired Hypixel Studios in 2020, not long after Hypixel gave us our first look at Hytale, and then a half-decade later pulled the plug on the whole thing and shut the studio down without anything to show for it. Hypixel co-founder Noxy, who went to Riot along with the studio, said when the game was cancelled that \"after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.\" That happens sometimes, sure, but the situation took something of an awkward twist when, after some presumably fast-and-furious negotiations, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought …",

Mobygames lists 33 titles with a Ron Perlman appearance, including Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, Halo 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and of course the Fallout games. His turns in Fallout are especially interesting because they're his most iconic videogame work, and yet it's only four simple words: \"War. War never changes.\" The intro to each Fallout game spins off differently from there, but those four words are an essential pillar of the series, every bit as thematically foundational as power armor or Nuka Cola.

If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content. Rockstar now hopes to give creators a place to share and sell their work, such as props, scripts, maps, \"and much more.\" (I…",

He decided that installing and running the construction and management simulation game, Factorio , on a hard drive, like a normal human, is far too straight forward. So, why not use 3.5-inch floppy disks. Like, over a thousand of 'em. This immediately throws up almost countless problems, starting with the circa 1.5 MB capacity of a double-sided variant of such a disk and the fact that they're not made any longer. That's before you even think about the technicalities. Factorio is a very small game by modern standards, taking up about 1 GB to 1.5 GB of storage space once installed. But that's absolutely massive if a floppy disk is your metric. Cost is an immediate problem, with 10 old-stock floppies apparently costing about $23, you're looking at about $2,500 in floppies adding in some spares. In the end, DocJade managed to source 1,250 disks from floppydisk.com for an undisclosed pr…",

Going from a yearly \"chapter\" formula to a seasonal structure where, in a recent conversation I had with executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini, \"nothing is off the table.\" A huge part of this shift has been in addressing long-standing quality-of-life complaints: Update 49 will begin to tackle a ton of long-standing bugbears, such as the time it takes to train mounts, after Zenimax put together a dedicated team whose job is to listen to community complaints and nip them in the bud. Or, as Kath puts it, a team with a \"mandate of: Let's find out what everybody wants to do, and let's do that.\" Some of these planned changes have been a long time coming, and while it can be easy to wonder why a team might drag their feet on such tweaks, Giacomini explains that a lot of these fixes have been a thorn in the developer's paw for a while, as well. \"We communicate with our players, we read, we listen, we play the game—it wasn't like we were blind to the things that players were …",

For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

    "body": "It's pretty incredible that Hytale launched into early access today. It's a miracle it even exists at all, really: games canceled by major studios typically vanish forever. Remember Blizzard's survival game Odyssey that was canceled after nearly eight years in development? Poof. Gone, tragically leaving behind nothing more than a handful of leaked screenshots. So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go. Back in November, Hypixel Studios CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme said the adventure sandbox ' isn't good yet ', but it already feels pretty good to me. As you'd probably expect from a game that looks like Minecraft and acts like Minecraft and is made by former Minecraft modders—it sure is a lot like M…",

    "body": "I don't know about you, but I'm sick of dying to bears, and the mean grizzlies expedited my search to get iron in Hytale since my weapons fashioned from rocks and sticks just weren't cutting it. I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed. What you'll need to get iro…",
