Add another week and you have the longest-running No. 1 by a female English artist, Kate Bush, whose 1985 song “Running Up That Hill” topped out for nine weeks in 2022, thanks to its sync in season four of Stranger Things . The all-time crown belongs to Tones And I’s “Dance Monkey,” a monster which led the ARIA Chart for 24 non-consecutive weeks in 2019 and 2020. Further down the latest ARIA Singles Chart, published late Friday, Jan. 2, Dean’s “So Easy (To Fall In Love)” dips 5-7 and “Nice To Each Other” holds at No. 9.
