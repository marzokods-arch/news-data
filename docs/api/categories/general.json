The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 43-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week.

The singer &#8212; who previously stopped through NYC&#8217;s Madison Square Garden in October 2024 &#8212; was poised, energetic and appeared to be having the the time of her life on stage, playing the first of two back-to-back shows at the venue on her mammoth Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour supporting last year&#8217;s album of the same name. If anything, Eilish&#8217;s marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don&#8217;t Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration &#8220;Guess&#8221; with impressive stamina and musicality.
