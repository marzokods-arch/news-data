Turning Point USA, founded by late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, announced its &#8220;All-American Halftime Show&#8221; soon after Bunny was revealed as the halftime headliner. The TPUSA show is aimed at being a &#8220;counterprogram&#8221; to the official Super Bowl halftime show, with Turning Point noting the show has the aim of &#8220;celebrating faith, family and freedom.&#8221; Related How to Watch Turning Point USA&#8217;s &#8216;All-American Halftime Show&#8217;&nbsp;Online Kid Rock Promises His Turning Point Halftime Show Will Be For People Who &#8216;Love Football, Love America, Love Good Music and Love&nbsp;Jesus&#8217; Kid Rock Shares Kobe Bryant Quote About Loving the &#8216;Haters&#8217; Amid Turning Point Halftime Show&nbsp;Backlash The line…",

Among the highlights for the song are 10 weeks at No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and being named Billboard&#8217;s Song of the Summer . It has been streamed more than 2.4 billion times around the world, and spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Global 200 chart. Propelled by the song’s success, Warren was nominated for a best new artist Grammy and won best new artist at the MTV Video Music Awards and the iHeart Awards. He also made some famous friends along the way, duetting with Jelly Roll on their collaboration, “Bloodline,” which they performed together at Stagecoach.

For Cole, the embattled MC has weathered his share of trials and tribulations since stepping away from the heavyweight bout between Drake and Kendrick Lamar in 2024.

Disc 29 tells a story of me returning to my hometown at age 29,” Cole wrote on Instagram earlier this past Wednesday (Feb. 4). He continued: “A decade after moving to New York, accomplishing what would have seemed impossible to most, I was at a crossroads with the three loves of my life: my woman, my craft, and my city. Disc 39 gives insight into my mindset during a similar trip home, this time as a 39-year-old man — older and a little closer to peace.” With limited features — including appearances by Future, Burna Boy, and Tems — …",

The international variant of the iPhone 18 Pro could feature a battery capacity ranging between 5,100 and 5,200mAh. This will be higher than the battery capacity expected of the Galaxy S26 Ultra. With the launch of the iPhone 17 Pro last year, Apple flipped the narrative around minimal upgrades to its flagship phones. Even though the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were only slightly refashioned, the changes were enough to make it the highest-selling phone series of the past quarter. One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra.

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air. TIG welding doesn’t leave behind splatter or residue, giving a clean, precise weld. Metal Inert Gas (MIG) Welding: Whi…",

T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria.

From a dedicated shortcut for on-device folders to a complete refresh of the Backup settings and photo details view, Google is refining nearly every corner of the app experience.

MANGMI is less than a day away from launching the cheapest 7-inch gaming handheld on the market, the Pocket Max , but the deal just became a little sweeter. Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

Now a tipster is sharing a vague hint that might point to a possible commercial release. Cameras need space. Manufacturers have done an utterly remarkable job creating some incredibly compact lens-and-sensor assemblies — so much so that for the vast majority of us, our phones are now our primary cameras — but when you really want to go above and beyond with features and image quality, that means growing past the confines of our phones. One way a number of brands have been doing that is through add-on lenses , but last last year, one phone company teased an even more impressive add-on — and it could soon be ready to make its commercial debut.

The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following that early look last month, nationwide sales of the E10 platform are opening today. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",
