Originally, they couldn't, he said. When you press the button, you'd always swap back to a human. During alpha testing, however, nobody was a fan of that. \"We had so much negativity around the fact that you couldn't dodge roll as an animal that people just had this thing of, like, I want to stay as a bear. They didn't care about the fact that the gameplay was better if you didn't do it, etc, etc,\" he explained. \"So, then we really had to set a challenge for our animators, kind of quite late in the game, of like can we make a dodge roll for the bear—well, for all three animal forms?\" Rogers said.

What's better: Bleak House's sharp satire of the British establishment, or finding the jetpack in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ? For my money: obviously the latter, but I guess we can finally put that old chestnut to bed, as is often done with chestnuts. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser—who left the studio in 2020—has been on the interview circuit recently, promoting his new novel, and in the process of a recent chat with The Guardian , settled the debate for good: the Grand Theft Auto games are \"not as good as Dickens.\" Case closed. Wrap it up, GTAilures. Alright, yes, I am having fun with words. While Houser does think the GTA games aren't as good as ol' Dickens, he made the statement while making a broader point about how he approaches writing and designing them, which is more interesting but less funny. Recalling the time he was doing interviews to promote GTA 4's expansion packs, he remembered a French journalist telling him, \"Well, the Grand Theft Auto games are just like Dickens!\" That stuck with Houser. \"I was like, 'God bless you for saying that!' But I thought about it afterwards and, well, they’re not…",

    "body": "Ever since we knew that Fallout's second season would be taking us to New Vegas (so, uh, since the end of Fallout's first season), the internet has reverberated with just one question: which ending will it be, Todd? Fallout: New Vegas had plenty of ending slides that could go in plenty of directions, but the biggest question at the end of the game was this: who won the Second Battle of Hoover Dam? Does the New California Republic bring Vegas under its control? Does Caesar's Legion turn it into a new Rome? Does Mr House outplay them both and secure his own, autocratic rule? Or (the correct answer) do the people of New Vegas shake off all these encroaching bureaucrats and tyrants in the Independent, or Yes Man, ending? We have our answer: none of the above. In an interview with IGN , Fallout season 2 executive producer Jonathan Nolan said that the show had deliberately taken \"the fog of war approach\" to picking a canon ending for the original game. He seems quite pleased with the choice, calling it \"an absolutely brilliant way to make a bit of an end run around that whole question.\" In other words, 15 years after the end of New Vegas—when Fallout's second season takes place—everyone…",

In a chat with our Elie Gould ahead of the release of Fallout season 2, the conversation alighted on the topic of what faction Howard would sign up with if he happened to wake up in the Wasteland tomorrow. His answer? The Brotherhood of Steel. \"I usually say the Brotherhood,\" Howard mused, \"because they have the best toys. I feel like I could use some power armour.\" Which, alright, fair enough. Being ensconced inside a bipedal tank probably would be quite useful in the grim, post-apocalyptic future. However, I'm afraid it's still the wrong answer.

Given the huge success the game has gone on to enjoy, ongoing support seemed inevitable. According to PC Gamer's official data partner, Newzoo , Ball X Pit has accumulated at least 744,000 players (with a majority on Xbox, where the game was available on Game Pass).

If that doesn't sound revolutionary to you, you must not understand that the true endgame of every MMO is fashion. In all seriousness, it's actually a pretty huge move. Previously, FF14's glamour system, which allows you to layer sets of appearances over your current gear, only permitted you to do so with gear that can be equipped by your current job and level. Starting with Patch 7.4, this will no longer be the case, opening up a whole new world of fashion options. This came as a surprise to players, due to the game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P)'s past stance on the issue—even in the face of job-agnostic gear that was increasingly allowing players to throw plate armour onto their White Mages. Talking to Famitsu in an interview, Yoshi-P reveals why (note: these quotes have been machine-translated): \"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview.

While this mod might not be as popular among players, it certainly feels just as exciting.

    "body": "So you're wondering why you've suddenly been reduced to 50% HP while trying to explore The Great Hollow map? Elden Ring Nightreign 's new Shifting Earth event has a special (and somewhat annoying) mechanic called the ' crystal curse ', which inflicts a half-health reduction whenever you enter the castles or ruins in each corner of the map. This isn't ideal since those areas contain the best weapons and are the most lucrative when it comes to farming runes and gaining strength to face the new night bosses. Below, I'll explain what you need to do to complete the event and remove the curse so you can take on those areas at full HP. How to complete The Great Hollow in Elden Ring Nightreign You have to shatter four crystals around the map (Image credit: FromSoftware) Except for giving you an entirely different map, The Great Hollow event inflicts you with the crystal curse, a debuff that reduces your HP to 50% when you enter one of the region's big strongholds or castles. You can try to take these on at half health, but it's a challenge. Instead, to complete The Great Hollow and shatter the crystal curse, you have to find and break four crystals around the map .

It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

Case in point, Taiwanese memory manufacturer and distributor Transcend has apparently not received a new NAND Flash shipment since at least October, when prices first really started to spike . According to company communication shared by @jukan05 on X , NAND Flash suppliers Samsung and Sandisk have delayed the latest planned shipment once more (via Techpowerup ). As a result, Transcend's \"Q4 chip allocation has been significantly reduced.\" “The situation worsened in Q4 due to increased demand from large data centers and hyperscalers driven by major cloud service providers’ expansion plans. All major chip manufacturers are prioritizing supply for these customers, which has led to price increases and extremely… pic.twitter.com/q5Wp6N38dm December 3, 2025 Long story short, SSD pricing will likely rise in the near future.

It's been aeons since I last looked at a membrane keyboard positing itself as a value-oriented gaming option – the Glorious GMBK is the latest one to enter through the revolving door of potential disappointment. Okay, I'm starting things on a sombre note, and I apologise for that. Maybe it's because I've seen it all before, but a £50/$60 membrane keyboard touting itself as a value-driven gaming keyboard with all the flashy RGB you could ever want is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Nonetheless, the Glorious GMBK is here, and I've been employed by hardware overlord Jacob to give you my thoughts and opinions, so here you go…… …. It's alright.

Sure, I think we can all see the utility of augmented reality tech mounted on a discreet, sunglasses-framed heads-up-display. However, I'm not sure many of us are comfortable with the idea of internet-connected, outward-facing cameras being pointed at us in public by the people who wear them. Well, should you be concerned that someone in the near vicinity might be wearing a pair of Zuck-o-specs , may I introduce the Meta Ray-Ban detector (via Hackaday ). This handy little device merrily lights up a sign emblazoned with the word \"glasshole\" whenever a pair are nearby—and the good news is, you can build one for yourself. This nifty little creation has been put together by GitHub user sh4d0wm45K, and they've even put a handy .gif of the device in action on the project page . It works by detecting the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' Bluetooth address via some custom code running on an ESP32 devboard, which then lights up two lines of white LEDs on a custom PCB whenever the specs are within range. You have to get pretty close, as you can see from the demonstration. It's unclear if the bright yellow bucket hat our creator is we…",

    "body": "The MSI Forge GK600 is a tenkeyless (TKL) gaming keyboard, meaning it's missing the numberpad. But Katie, I hear you say, if a normal keyboard has all the keys you could ever want, what's the point getting rid of them in favour of a TKL board? Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE . Its dedicated navigation and direction keys aren't being swallowed up by the mass of other keys, so you don't need to fumble around for them, while the two-col…",
