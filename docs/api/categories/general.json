    "body": "Laufey opened a two-night stand at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles on Friday (Sept. 26) with a show that captured her unique place in pop — her music is rooted in jazz, but her concert has pop-superstar production values. The A Matter of Time Tour, the Icelandic singer-songwriter’s third tour and her first that consists entirely of arena dates, began on Sept. 15 in Orlando. It will conclude in Kópavogur, Iceland, on March 15, 2026. Laufey (it’s pronounced LAY-vay, for those still catching up to her) won a Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album in 2024 for her sophomore album, Bewitched , and she could be headed for another win in that category on Feb. 1 for her third album, A Matter of Time . The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 4. It has topped Billboard ’s Jazz Albums chart for the past four weeks. ( Bewitched logged 102 weeks at No. 1 on that chart.)

    "body": "FNC Entertainment — the agency behind P1Harmony and AOA , whose 2014 hit “Miniskirt” is still covered worldwide — may be best remembered as one of the early drivers of band music’s mainstream popularity in K-pop. For newer fans, that legacy might come as a surprise. Beginning with FTISLAND in 2007, followed by CNBLUE and N.Flying , FNC Entertainment has long explored the intersection of rock and K-pop. More than a decade later, the label is introducing a new band: AxMxP (pronounced A-M-P) , a four-member unit consisting of vocalist/rapper HA YOO JOON, guitarist/vocalist KIM SHIN, drummer CRU, and bassist/vocalist JU HWAN. Their name stands for Amplify Music Power , symbolizing a mission to broadcast their voices through music like an amplifier. Officially debuting on Sept. 10, AxMxP embodies the essence of a true rookie, arriving with a full-length self-titled album spanning 10 tracks that traverse punk rock, rock ballad, modern pop-rock and hip-hop rock. At their debut showcase, held before more than 2,000 fans, the members — all between ages 15 and 20 — powered through the entire setlist with striking poise and even moments of relaxed enjoyment.

This annual event offers an opportunity for earthlings to celebrate the inspiring bond between Earth and the Moon, and, this year, to share in the excitement of NASA’s preparations for Artemis II. Launching in early 2026, the mission will send four astronauts on a nearly 10-day flight past the Moon and back. On Saturday, the Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase, with most of its face lit up by the Sun. Given these lighting conditions, viewers will be able to see many interesting sites with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes — depending on local weather. Moon observers will see large, dark patches on the Moon called “maria,” or “seas” in Latin.
