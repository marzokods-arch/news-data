But the wheels are continuing to turn. The most recent sign of progress comes from Mass Effect executive producer Michael Gamble, who's looking for help getting the new game done. \"Hi, I’m hiring a very important senior leadership role,\" Gamble wrote on X . \"They’ll report to me and it’s gonna be awesome.\" The post includes a link to a job listing for a production director on the next Mass Effect game. Before you get too excited, this is a high-level position (pay range is $187,000 - $259,400 CDN plus benefits), so you're not going to get any details about the game itself except that it will be the next chapter of \"one of the highest-rated and most celebrated series in video game history.\" Except for the last chapter, I suppose.

Now, after receiving a second DMCA notice from publisher 505 Games over his VR conversion mod for Ghostrunner, Ross has opted for the nuclear option and removed access to all 40+ of his VR mods from his Patreon rather than distribute them for free. \"Due to DMCA notices received from CD Projekt S.A. and 505 Games, I am forced to temporarily pause the Patreon page,\" says a disclaimer on the About page of Ross's Patreon. \"You can still subscribe if you want to support me, but be advised that for the moment there will be no benefits available.

While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so. The third option is GOG , but you might want to wait just to buy there: At the time of writing, GOG has just announced th…",

And also give feedback about what you want in the game.\" But the second closed beta won't just be more of the same. This time, players will be able to play in a new arena, the Nordic Shore, a location covered in the remnants of ancient battles and has a huge sea monster skeleton running across it. And to fill this new space, there'll be new toys to mess around with. \"As you know, the spellcasters can infuse the creatures, and for the first time, the …",

GOG– which is under new ownership —has joined the likes of Spotify, Steam , PlayStation, Xbox, and even virtual bank Monzo, to offer us the chance to see how many games we played, how many achievements we earned, and how many hours we spent living out other lives. GOG shared the news of this new feature earlier today on X . It's called GOG Year 2025, and it provides a breakdown of how you played. My favourite part of the feature isn't the info on the games I played, but how long I've had my GOG account. It's been active for six years, back before I was even a videogame journalist. I was still at university finishing my Master's degree. I asked around the PC Gamer office (I sent a DM in Slack) and it turns out our staffers prefer to use GOG for retro games like Dino Crisis –which GOG recently brought back to life —and The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall . They'll be getting their pension payments soon. What's interesting is that it seems gamers on GOG get more achievements than those on Steam. The average number for GOG is 14, whereas the medi…",

This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation.

An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging.

However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust. However, one of the biggest complaints levied at Secure Boot is on behalf of Linux gamers. While Linux does have something called Secure Boot, that's not w…",

In their latest video, Der8auer claims that the OPP is \"basically like a cashback thing where Nvidia tried to actively influence the AIBs and the pricing to make sure that some cards happen on the market and that they are actually being sold by the AIBs for the MSRP.\" Without that incentive scheme in place, Der8auer argues, \"You will have to expect massive price increases across all of these cards. So that means that MSRP that Nvidia communicated in the past basically no longer exists\" Der8auer says they don't know what the OPP actually stands for, but Hardware Luxx argues it to be 'Open Price Program' .

In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive.

I haven't tried out the necromancy system myself yet, but from what I've gathered, players first have to gather physical components by killing skeletons,…",

    "body": "Fable developer Playground Games seems to have its priorities in order: its reimagining of fantasy world Albion is full of beautiful scenery, the tone remains goofy, and there are choices to make that leave an impact on the people around you. More important than all that, though, is that Albion's citizens are each unique, and you can woo every single one of them. \"We maybe once thought we could procedurally generate them,\" Playground founder Ralph Fulton told IGN in an interview . But that idea quickly went out the window as the Fable team decided they \"wanted to craft every one of these NPCs from their name, to their appearance, to their personality traits, to [their] moral worldview … to where they work and where they live and what their family unit is.\" Albion being populated by 1,000 distinct characters is clearly a big talking point for the new Fable, but I got a chuckle out of Fulton bringing up—unprompted!—that you can put a ring on all of them, too. \"You can go and speak to every single one of them in fully voiced conversations,\" he said. \"You could marry... it'll be a bit of work, but you could marry them all.

Upcoming stealth-immersive-platform-brawler-prank sim DreadBound fits the bill. From its first trailer , DreadBound looks to be taking a page from the likes of Dark Messiah of Might & Magic or 2025's best immersive sim, Skin Deep, by embracing the slapstick and improvisational side of the genre, rather than cerebral exploration. In DreadBound's first trailer, I clocked instantly deploying spike traps, oil slicks to trip enemies (or set them on fire), Ravenholm-style circular saw projectiles that you can embed in walls and use as platforms to reach high places, and an homage to my favorite quick melee in all of gaming, the Dark Messiah kick. Rather than the handcrafted levels typical of immersive sims, DreadBound will feature \"a cursed city that changes every time you die.\" That gave this Roguelikephobic gamer some pause, but roguelike and immsim, when attempted in the past, have often proven to be a chocolate and peanut butter genre combo.

The notorious adult content addon is one of the biggest Sims 4 mods out there, quickly updated after every official patch as fans lament they can't bear to play without it. It sure feels like everyone but me is Wicked-pilled, which may not be far from the truth: The mod's creator says that it gets launched an astonishing 400,000 times per day. German news site Taz (Die Tageszeitung) published an interview this week with Turbodriver, the modder behind Wicked Whims and its less naughty equivalent Wonderful Whims. It's a bit of a drive-by in which Turbodriver only briefly touches on topics like being compensated for modding, access to adult content online, and whether he finds his mods controversial. The details about himself he's willing to share (his identity not among them), mostly boil down to not seeing himself as an educator or an activist. Wicked Whims has contraception, explicit sex, and abortion, but that's in pursuit of the realism that players want more than making a statement, he claims. What was way more enlightening to me was the girthy daily player count that Turbodriver…",
