The latter story involved the Kansas City Chiefs tight end attending Swift&#8217;s June 2024 Eras show in London, where he was sat in the VIP box alongside actor Grant and his wife, Anna Eberstein, who Kelce apparently confused with Barbie director Greta Gerwig. In describing her mega-FOMO about looking out at the raucous celeb-packed box that night — also at the London show were Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, Liam Hemsworth, Tom Cruise and all of Kelce&#8217;s best friends from Cleveland — Swift described being jealous at the shot-taking and party atmosphere in the roped-off section, with Taylor worrying that her 6&#8217;6&#8243; intended&#8217;s hard dancing might actually shake the tent to the ground. &#8220;The most fun thing about having Travis out on tour is that he would go to the ten…",
