That's where the backpack upgrade comes in, letting you handily increase your inventory size. Chances are, you've inspected your inventory and seen the small prompt about the backpack upgrade next to your character, but have no clue how to get or use it. I'll go over all of that below, as it's not even clear how the backpack upgrade works once you've crafted it. How to craft the backpack upgrade in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) You can unlock the backpack by crafting the upgrade in the 'tinkering' section of the Workbench. This requires: Eight iron ingots 16 medium leather Iron is located in deep caves in all biomes, including the starting Emerald Wilds area, and you'll get medium hide from predators like wolves, which you can turn into leather at a Tanning Rack.

To save you the hassle that I went through, below I'll cover how to get softwood planks. It's not as simple as just chopping down the right type of tree, either, as you need to process the logs, too.

Fortunately, the pastel-coloured, My Sims-esque world of Heartopia came along just as I felt myself disconnecting from life sims entirely. And, while it's by no means perfect and there are a number of bugs (like the fact it keeps snowing inside of my house) I keep coming back each day to check in with my little avatar and see what quests are waiting and what daily rewards I can redeem.

As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory. He puts it in stark terms for Hansen, \"The AI companies bought, like, 40% of the wafer production. We're not even talking finished goods, like, packages—not even chips. They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

But, you won't be able to tame these animals. Instead, we can only unlock dogs and cats as pets in Heartopia, and we've got to put in the work to get there first. Heartopia is all about hobbies, and caring for cats and dogs comes as two separate tasks. You need to make your way through a number of D.G. Member levels before you can get there, but it's well worth the effort once you lay eyes on these fuzzy friends. Here's how you can unlock pets in Heartopia. How to unlock pets in Heartopia You'll unlock the ability to care for pets when you reach Level 12 as a D.G. Member. As soon as you've hit this milestone, you'll be given a quest that tasks you with talking to Mrs. Joan in her adoption centre in the middle of town. When you speak to Mrs. Joan, she will talk you through the process of adopting an animal. Unfortunately for dog lovers, you will have to go with a cat first as part of the quest, but if you speak to Mrs. Joan straight after, she'll start talking to you about the dogs. There are three dogs and three cats available…",

If the last episode of Fallout Season 2 left you hoping for a knockdown, dragout fight with a deathclaw, I've got some bad news for you. After not one, not two, but three deathclaws make a dramatic entrance on the New Vegas strip, Lucy and The Ghoul make a wise but fairly unexciting decision, and one we've all made when encountering a big monster in a game: they just sprint past them and load into a new map. Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter.

So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go.

If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG.

    "body": "As the memory supply crisis rages, is now really the time to tout a set up with 256 GB of DDR5-7200 RAM? Gigabyte seems to think so. At CES 2026, Gigabyte introduced its Clocked Unbuffered Dual In-Line Memory Module (or CQDIMM), allowing for high-capacity memory PCs to run without the otherwise common compromises to stability and frequency. The tech was shown off, alongside BIOS tuning software, in a set-up built upon the CQDIMM Edition of the Z890 Aorus Tachyon ICE motherboard. Inside were two beefy sticks of 128 GB RAM, for a total 256 GB of DDR5-7200 memory—twice as much as the standard version. \"On the hardware side, Gigabyte has optimized motherboard circuit layouts to significantly reduce memory channel loading, improving signal integrity and ensuring stable operation even under heavy workloads,\" the company explains. \"Complementing the hardware advancements is Gigabyte’s sophisticated BIOS tuning technology. Through an optimized clock driver architecture, Gigabyte’s BIOS intelligently manages timing, signal synchronization, and voltage behavior to unleash extreme performance.\" Gigabyte has a track record of pushing DDR5 memory to its limits but, generally speaking, that muc…",

Goodman Games has been making some of the best ever for years now, as part of its Dungeon Crawl Classics series. They're unapologetically old school—weird, scary, and absolutely bursting with creativity. So I'm excited to see that Humble Bundle is offering a huge bundle of DCC books , including some of the coolest adventures it's released over the last decade and change. (Image credit: Goodman Games) These are all written for the Dungeon Crawl Classics system—Goodman Games' gonzo take on the original D&D rules—but are easily adapted to any system built for retro dungeon crawling, such as Old School Essentials, Mörk Borg, Shadowdark, or Knave. The 98 item tier is the standout here, offering all the adventures in PDF form, plus the DCC core rulebook, supplements, and assets for virtual tabletop play, for $18 / £13.43. I know we're probably all a bit jaded to massive bundles at this point, but that really is a wild amount of stuff for the money. A lot of my favourite ever dungeons are in there, including: People of …",

    "body": "While we weren't expecting any major PC gaming announcements from Nvidia at this year's CES event, it was still somewhat disappointing that the main things we got were an update to DLSS and a new version of G-Sync Pulsar . But that's okay, because as it so happens, they're both actually pretty good. Well, in the case of the new DLSS 4.5, it's mostly good. With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas. You'll probably need to restart the app after that so that the program can che…",
