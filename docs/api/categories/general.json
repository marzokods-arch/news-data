    "body": "If you're diving into Silent Hill f on PC this weekend, you might notice you have some extra digital goodies you didn't pay for. As reported by GamesRadar , some players on the Steam version of the game were accidentally given access to special content that was supposed to be exclusive to pre-order and deluxe editions, which included additional outfits, an item pack, a digital art book, and a digital soundtrack. Some of this content was made available to players who only purchased the regular standard version of Silent Hill f. While it's unclear how much of the exclusive content leaked to standard edition players, several people on the Silent Hill subreddit reported getting access to exclusive outfits, but not the soundtrack or other bonuses. Before you get too excited about free in-game items, it doesn't look like Konami will let the mix-up slide. A post on the official Silent Hill X (formerly Twitter) account addressed the situation on Friday, stating, \"We’re investigating an issue on the Steam version of Silent Hill f where bonus and pre-order content not included in the purchased edition is temporarily accessible. A patch is scheduled to be released soon. Thank you for your co…",

The Copper Age game drop, which was announced back in August , finally got a full reveal and release date during Minecraft Live on Saturday. This update will introduce a slew of new copper items to the game including weapons, tools, armor, horse armor, chests, lanterns, torches, chains, and bars. There will also be a new copper golem mob that autonomously organizes items you leave in copper chests into nearby regular chests. Like other copper items, the golems can oxidize and change color over time. While I wish I could have made all of those copper items when the ore was first added to the game in 2021, better late than never. Copper tools and gear have been in Java mods for a while now, so it's nice to see them officially added to the vanilla version. Copper is much easier to find early on in a new Minecraft world than iron, so this update will make it easier to gear up right after spawning into a new game. While it's pretty time consuming mining and smelting copper for building, its abundance at surface level in the overworld makes it perfect for crafting starting gear. The…",

Over the course of its 30 years in the industry, BioWare has developed some of the best and most memorable RPGs of all time. Though its present success may be a little in doubt, that legacy remains an astonishing addition to videogame canon. Which is why I expect you to remember it all, down to every last title. Today's quiz is simple—you just have to name every game BioWare has ever made. To be clear, that's only games it developed itself, and only ones that actually released—no cancelled projects. But to warn you, it does include some games that didn't come out on PC. I'm afraid you do have to remember the one time they made an RPG for a Nintendo handheld. And just to make it a bit trickier, you've got to do it in two minutes. Ready? Scroll down to the quiz below to start. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

This would be the largest such leveraged buyout ever recorded. According to the WSJ's anonymous sources, EA could be sold for as much as $50 billion, though the final price has not yet been agreed on, and EA has an estimated market value of $43 billion. The group of investors reportedly includes the private equity firm Silver Lake and the government of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal could be announced as early as next week, and would be the largest leveraged buyout ever recorded. A leveraged buyout is when a private equity firm uses a significant amount of borrowed money to seal the deal, with the asset set to be acquired used as collateral in the debt.

Presented via Steam news post, the new mechanic is the \"tumble grab.\" When the update drops, you'll be able to latch onto things even after you've flung your condensed little trashcan body. Once the red outlines on the edges of the screen turn yellow, you can grab weapons and items—and even the level geometry. While tumble grabbing, your beam will be able to grapple onto any surface. That means you can, with some finesse, climb up walls and across the ceiling by flinging your tumbling body. Your tumble grabbing ability is tied to your stamina, however, so there's at least going to be one limiting factor preventing complete wall-climbing chaos. \"Tumble Grab also means that you can grab stuff in situations you previously couldn’t,\" Semiwork said. \"For example, if you’re levitated by the vicious Mentalist, you can grab a weapon and fight back!\" Semiwork demonstrated the power of the tumble grab in an accompanying video .

In the video that accompanied the post, game director Jonathan Rogers explained that GGG is pushing those updates now to give them a little more time to breathe before the next content update, which should come sometime around the end of the year. Path of Exile 2's 0.3 update, The Third Edict, came out at the end of August to warm reception . Introducing Act 4 released us from the hell of running Acts 1-3 twice whenever we want to level a character, the Abyss mechanic is fun and rewarding, and in general the community has been happy with the direction of the game. One thorny issue that continues to plague PoE2, however, is the endgame. Currently, in order to juice our maps and for the best rewards, we have to navigate the Atlas of Worlds until we find a spot with multiple overlapping towers. The more towers, the more slots we have for tablets, the more loot we get. This leads to a problem where all the maps we run that don't have multiple towers near them feel like wasting time, something to slog through unt…",

But it does get better, especially once you realise that you can just ignore most of the monsters you come across. I'm something of a magpie and a hoarder in survival horror games, which means that I collect every single item I come across and then never want to use them. So my solution to this has always been to rely on being as sneaky as possible and perfecting the art of the dodge. And just like most survival games, it works a charm: I found every single note, letter, item, and omamori in Silent Hill f, and I hardly killed a thing. (Image credit: Konami) One of the benefits of Silent Hill f being a third-person horror game is that you can play corners; I used this to check corners and alleyways before I walked around or past them.

It looks a little similar to Lowiro's mobile gameplay, with a little bit of the arcadeyness from Sound Voltex and Ongeki in there to boot.

Speaking with TheGameBusiness at Gamescom, Bellamy reiterated that Jagex is still on that straight (pun not intended) and narrow: \"The team have been looking at the way the product currently is, the happiness of players, where they're finding frustration… If we believe this game has another 25 years, what do we need to change? And monetization is near the top of that list.\" These included \"experiments\"—temporary removals or adjustments to certain microtransaction systems to make them, well, less bad: \"Treasure hunter is our microtransaction layer, and we did the total removal of that temporarily. That hasn't been done since it was implemented in 2012.\" Kudos where kudos are due, Bellamy seems open to the idea that his company might make less money for a while: \"We probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are when we make these changes. That's the truth. But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, …",

Sometimes, though, you do just want some healing, and the Kill Spring does just that in spades. This legendary repkit keeps you at full health thanks to seeking healing orbs. That might sound a little boring, but it's the perfect addition to glass cannon builds or those with skills that give you bonuses based on your health. Like the Bod legendary shotgun, it's a bit of a pain to get though, so here's what you need to do. How to get the Kill Spring in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Kill Spring legendary repkit from the Axemaul boss at the end of the Toil of Spoiling Vis mine, in the centre of Dominion's Carcadia District , near The Lockaway safehouse. To unlock the Dominion region, you must first complete all three outer regions' main missions: Fadefields, Terminus Range, and Carcadia Burn.

Origins is essentially Habbo Hotel's answer to WoW Classic—a stripped-back version of the social MMO that's closer to its original browser days than… whatever NFT nonsense it was touting around back when that was a thing. It's described as \"Habbo as it was in 2005, lovingly restored,\" launching last summer as a standalone launcher for PC. Our own Harvey Randall dove in to try it out when servers went live, writing that Origins felt like \"some ancient insect preserved in amber.\" Of course, it had taken no time at all for folks to resurrect bygone traditions like blocking the pool ladder while declaring it to be closed, a scenario old Habbo heads will be all too familiar with. \"Habbo Hotel: Origins, truthfully, feels like stepping into a portal to a time where the internet was wild, anachronistic, and had an entirely different set of ways in which it'd scar unsupervised children for lif…",

As for why that's somehow incredibly useful, I'll get into that later, as it's quite build-dependent.

Which is why Forza Horizon 6 is headed to the land of the rising sun. In a chat with GamesRadar , the arcade racing sim's art director Don Arceta said that the series' Japanese venture would be \"our biggest map yet.\" But fear not, because it's \"also our most full.\" Just what you'd expect a dev on an upcoming release to say, I suppose, but I've got no reason to doubt Arceta. Playground hasn't run into much trouble creating bigger and more things-crammed worlds over the past couple of Horizon games, and it sounds like the studio didn't run into any trouble finding stuff to do in Japan, either. \"Obviously, we can't go bigger without filling it with things to do and see,\" said Arceta. \"And I think this map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense.

Which is a crime. But that crime has now been rectified: a modder named Nai has created HK Hornet Voice Restored (via GamesRadar ), happily restoring our heroine's barks. Now, your many attacks will be accompanied by all the hegales and adinos you could dream of. Which is, ah, maybe a bit annoying, actually? This might get me blacklisted for life, but if there's one thing I've taken from HK Hornet Voice Restored, it's that actually Team Cherry might have had a reason for yoinking her voice away when players are in control of her.

My favorite, Advance Wars: Dual Strike for the Nintendo DS, is more the Chess 2 of strategy games.
