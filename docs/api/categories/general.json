But now it's December, and with just 31 days remaining before the deadline hits, the dev team says they're not going to make it. Stxy: Blades of Greed is now set to launch on February 19, 2026 , a relatively brief pause that will give Cyanide time to \"polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking,\" and ensure that Styx's big comeback lives up to expectations. And what are those expectations? For that we'll throw back to Shaun, PC Gamer's number-one Styx guy, who noted that Master of Shadows and the follow-up Shards of Darkness both earned review scores in the upper 70s, \"which sounds about right.\" Styx is also enough of a headliner to be the marquee guy in our recent quiz about videogame goblins , which reminded me (consider this a freebie answer if you haven't taken it yet) that Styx did not emerge into our world fully formed, but was actually a supporting character in the 201…",

Grivel said when he left Ubisoft in October 2022 that after 11 years at the company, \"it is now time for me to go on a new adventure.\" That adventure, according to his LinkedIn profile, took him immediately to Electronic Arts, where he spent a year and a half working on Battlefield 6 as studio design director at Ridgeline Games. That came to an end when Ridgeline closed in early 2024 as part of major cuts at EA , and so Grivel tripped back to Ubisoft to work briefly on \"an unannounced project in conception phase.\" He left again at the end of 2024 to join Worlds Untold—just in time for that studio to fall victim to major cuts at NetEase . And now he's back where it all began. \"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!\" Grivel wrote on LinkedIn (via GamesRadar ). \"A very special team and project to me.\" If you're hoping that Grivel follo…",

Indeed, the game's executive producer Michael Choung said the format had \" absolutely proven itself \" two weeks ago—sustaining interest in the game over a longer period than a one-and-done release likely would have. But Choung doesn't see the approach as some kind of magic bullet AdHoc—or any studio—can just apply to everything. \"It's insane to do,\" he told Edge's Knowledge newsletter . \"From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this.\" The game's lead producer, Natalie Herman, agreed with Choung: \"From a production perspective, we released four times. We were basically a live-service game for a month.\" The point Choung is making isn't that episodic releases ought to be avoided—that'd be an odd move from a developer whose game is on-track to beat its three-year \"bull case\" sales projections in three months—but rather that anyone looking on…",

Located on Funston Avenue in San Francisco in a large neoclassical building that used to be a Christian Scientist church, the Wayback Machine now maintains 29 years of web history. Back in 1996 at the inception of the archive, a whole year's worth of webpages added up to about 2 TB of storage. Now, a mere day soaks up 150 TB and a copy of the entire archive is 175 petabytes and counting upwards . In October, the Archive celebrated the successful storage of one trillion web pages. While a set of servers have been \"symbolically\" placed in the former church building, the whole archive isn't actually stored in the Funston Avenue locale. Most of the archive’s servers are in a warehouse outside San Francisco, with copies distributed throughout the world. Those backups aren't just prudent in the event of fire, flood or other physical catastrophe. CNN points out that the Trump administration has de…",

And before that... you get the picture. But, it seems that AMD is now quietly looking to dethrone its own top chip with a slightly improved version, dubbed the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D.

    "body": "There's been a deep, unfortunate friction between voice actors and videogame studios, recently—the looming spectre of AI hangs large over everything, with some bigwigs salivating at the idea of getting infinite performances out of people without actually paying them. That is, despite the fact that—aside from efforts so far mostly being bland as all hell, and confusing for the actual voice actors —players seem to have a deep appreciation for human performances. This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront.

And as someone who loves getting a long nail manicure, they were causing me to misinput all over the gaff. I tried fight sticks previously but couldn't get with the whole, well, stick part of it.

At launch, it suffered from \"some wonkily-threaded narrative beats\" and \"some general visual bugs and systems that felt a little obtuse at times\". No problems that couldn't be patched it seems, which made me put it on the \"wait\" pile rather than the \"play immediately\" pile.

On the other hand, recent indie games are incredibly unique, and often include the kind of systems you can't find in other games.\" He added that indie games are more or less all he plays: \"I play a lot of different indies, even smaller games, but I haven't really touched so-called AAA titles.\" It's a sentiment of fondness echoed by industry figures like Larian's Michael Douse, who once said that indies lead with their gut and \" to …",

Blue & Blood is an ambitious total conversion mod that reimagines the game from the other side of the law—not as a young gangster clawing his way up, but as a cop teetering on the edge of corruption. The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice. The result is something gritty and unmistakably GTA, and it’s being built by two people: Cascavel, a veteran roleplayer and modder, and giacobbe, a software engineer with a lifelong love for the series. Roleplay roots For Cascavel, Blue & Blood was born out of San Andreas Multiplayer. He spent years on a text-based server called Los Santos Roleplay, crafting characters and stories with hundreds of others in real time. \"That experience made me appreciate strong writing and believable characters,\" he says. That storytelling instinct followed him into modding. Cascavel began with pedestrian models, launched a successful Blender tutorial series, and explored total conversions like Frost…",

There was that time I got really into humming the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare every time I accomplished a task.

At time of writing, an hour has passed since the game hit a new all-time peak of 72,678, and while the number is flickering a bit, it's rare to see such a seemingly niche game so hoppin' over a decade after it came out. There are a few apparent reasons for this. The game just got two new DLCs on the same day: Nordic Horizons , which takes players through northern Scandinavia, and Forest Machinery , a smaller-scall add-on that piles on doodads like wood chippers and mulchers.

Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter.

They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer.

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

It's gimmicky and goofy as all hell. Rings fly as I crash and careen into other racers, dodging items takes far more knack than holding a banana to my ass and praying, and getting flung into entirely different tracks mid-race introduces all manner of frenzy. But my goodness if it isn't one of the most fun, solid-feeling kart racers I've played that doesn't involve an Italian plumber. (Image credit: SEGA) I'll throw my hands up now and admit I've never even really been a Sonic the Hedgehog enjoyer… I just really like Shadow and Rouge the Bat, for no reason in particular. While CrossWorlds is stuffed full of references that sweep the blue blur's quarter-century career—tracks that crib from levels featured across the series, callbacks to random fluff dialogue in games of yore, and even a shoutout to the classic Sega arcade rail shooter Galaxy Force 2—you certainly don't need to be storing all of that info up in your noggin to enjoy everything the racer has to offer.

    "body": "As I discussed in exuberant detail last weekend, Sektori is one of my favourite video games of 2025. The vast majority of people who play this Geometry Wars -inspired roguelike love it too, as its 97% positive Steam rating attests. But Steam's rapidly revolving release tombola means that making a great game is no guarantee of commercial success. And as Sektori's developer recently explained, the kaleidoscopic schmup is still a long way from making him any money. Reacting to Sektori's launch on Bluesky, former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen said reception to the twin-stick shooter had been \"awesome\" and \"much more than I expected for such a niche thing\". Lahtinen fully appreciates the highly specific appeal of Geometry Wars-style games, likely why Housemarque itself pivoted to making third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros. Now though, Lahtinen says the response to Sektori has given him hope. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. I went into this fully knowing I would never recoup. It would be my calling card, but nothing people would have ever heard of,\" he says. \"But 100+ Steam reviews, 97% positive + ~90 Metacritic is unexpected to say the least.\" Following this, …",

But Desert Strike, and its sequel Jungle Strike, were rare exceptions, and I distinctly recall us pad swapping as we picked our way through the latter's fiercely tricky night mission. It seems plenty of other people are nostalgic for EA's twin-stick chopper, as a spiritual successor to the Strike series is making waves on Steam (must be the rotor wash). Released last week, Cleared Hot has racked up a 98% 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating out of 1,200 reviews —not bad considering it's an early access title based on a genre that had its heyday more than 30 years ago. The main appeal of Cleared Hot is how it takes the template laid down by EA and upgrades the action with modern spectacle. Now, when your hellfire missiles thud into tanks and structure, they burst in a glorious, physics-powered shower of debris.
