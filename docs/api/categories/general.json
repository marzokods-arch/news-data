The company has confirmed a larger 4-inch display and the addition of dual analog sticks. A 2026 release window is provided, but specs, pricing, and performance remain unknown. We’re big fans of the original TrimUI Brick , and now the company is teasing a follow-up to the pocket-friendly handheld. The new device is called the TrimUI Brick Pro, and the teasers posted online suggest it will stick to the same Game Boy-style, vertical formula while adding more modern controls. In an Instagram post from its official account, TrimUI describes the Brick Pro as “the ultimate evolution of the vertical handheld.” The company says it has kept the ultra-portable DNA intact, but added a larger 4-inch display and dual analog sticks, arranged below the D-pad and face buttons. TrimUI also says the new layout has been reworked with modern gaming in mind, while still leaning into retro nostalgia.",

After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Leaked specs show Apple’s upcoming iPhones introducing cutting-edge features such as a new A20 Pro chip made with a 2nm process, under-display Face ID on the left edge of the screen, variable-aperture cameras, and potential support for satellite-based 5G. Meanwhile, Samsung appears to be releasing only minor upgrades for its upcoming Galaxy S26 series, as rivals significantly innovate — raising concerns about its competitiveness. Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September. Now, specs for all these upcoming iPhones have leaked again, and it’s not looking great for Samsung unless it pulls up its socks. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Previous announcements have already revealed that the Pocket Max will feature a Snapdragon 865 SoC, paired with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage. That would have been a flagship gaming handheld back in 2023, but nowadays it places it firmly in the mid-range category.",

I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions.

But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool.

MVNOs that rely on Verizon’s network also experienced disruptions, and now Verizon-owned-and-operated Visible is offering account credits, too — but they’re smaller than the ones affected Verizon customers were offered. As reported by 9to5Google , Visible has been sending texts to customers who temporarily lost service, apologizing for the outage and offering an account credit as “a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to” the MVNO. But while Verizon offered $20 account credits, Visible is only doling out a fraction of that, giving customers $5 toward their next bill.",

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.
