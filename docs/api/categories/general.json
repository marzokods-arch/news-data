    "body": "Pixel 9 Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority US Mobile is relaunching its Pixel 9 deal starting today at 5 PM EST. The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

But there’s also a lot of tech that’s not quite ready for prime time, and isn’t being publicly exhibited. I visited the BOOX booth today hoping to take another look at its great e-readers like the Palma 2 , but ended up getting a surprise early preview of the next generation of Palma, with a couple major upgrades in tow. Electronic paper displays have been nothing short of a revolution, and their ultra-low power demands, image retention capabilities, and exceptionally eye-friendly output have formed the foundation of the e-reader industry. We’ve come a long way from the early days of the Kindle, and companies like BOOX have continuously pushed the tech to new places with things like stylus input, color screens, and useful new form factors.",

The Galaxy S26 Edge could be thinner than its predecessor at its thinnest point, but this three-tiered camera bump could make it thicker overall. Previous leaks suggest the entire Galaxy S26 lineup could feature Qi2 magnets for wireless charging. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series isn’t due until early next year, but just yesterday, we got a good look at dummy units that showcased some interesting changes, like magnets across the lineup and a rather interesting look for the Galaxy S26 Edge. Now, new CAD renders give us an even better look at the Galaxy S26 Edge, and we’re getting a lot of iPhone 17 Pro vibes from it. Android Headlines has shared CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 Edge. These renders give us a good look at the device and reveal its dimensions.",

I asked Google Lens to scan and interpret these numbers for me, and I was informed that it reads “72 101 108 111 33” in decimal digits. Without me asking, the built-in AI also interpreted that these numbers represented the positions of various English alphabet letters in the list of ASCII characters, so I didn’t have to use my own brain cells trying to decode them.",

With the arrival of the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra , you might be wondering whether now is finally the right time to replace your aging Galaxy tablet. The answer here isn’t so cut and dry. It’s really less about age and more about whether the new models deliver a meaningful improvement to your existing experience.

Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Listen, foldables are cool — who doesn’t love big things that transform into smaller things — but they’re also becoming a little been-there-done-that as manufacturers really start getting comfortable with the form factor. And that sort of familiarity is probably exactly why so many of us have been shifting our interests slightly towards the growing crop of “tri-fold” devices like Samsung’s upcoming TriFold or the new Mate XTs .
