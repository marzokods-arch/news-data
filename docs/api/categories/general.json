    "body": "Credit: Sammobile TL;DR The Galaxy S26 series is expected to feature built-in magnets for native MagSafe accessory compatibility. A new “Magnet Wireless Charger” (EP-P2900) has been spotted, and it could support up to 25W charging for the Ultra and 20W for the other S26 models. Older devices like the Galaxy S25 and Z Fold 7 will also work with this charger, though at reduced 15W speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to launch next month, and one of the key upgrades across the lineup is expected to be the presence of Qi2 magnets built into the phones themselves. This would allow the Galaxy S26 series to be immediately compatible with a wide range of MagSafe accessories. Samsung plans to launch its own magnet accessories, too. Samsung’s upcoming magnetic wireless charging power bank has been spotted before, and now Samsung’s upcoming magnetic wireless charger has been spotted as well.

Vivo and OPPO debuted these new-generation add-on lenses, which can dramatically improve long-range camera zoom. The Galaxy S7 phones supported a 2x add-on lens back in 2016, but the Galaxy maker hasn’t adopted these new lenses just yet. The vivo X200 Ultra was the first Android phone to offer the new generation of telephoto extender lenses , and subsequent vivo and OPPO flagships support these add-on lenses too. These accessories attach to the phone’s telephoto camera to improve long-range zoom. Now, Apple could also be testing this tech for the iPhone 18 Pro series. Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu reported that Apple is evaluating teleconverter lenses, with an accompanying hashtag suggesting that this could land on the iPhone 18 Pro series.

In my previous rentals, I had a bath with a shower curtain, which made it easy to prop up my phone on the nearby vanity to play podcasts while I got ready in the morning. Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

Google Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser on PCs, but it also has a reputation for being a resource hog. Now, Google has implemented a toggle that’s convenient in theory, but also means the browser can suck up resources as soon as you start your computer. Chrome expert Leopeva64 reported on Twitter that Chrome Canary now offers an Open Chrome when my computer starts toggle on Windows. The toggle, which is apparently off by default but functional, opens a Chrome window as soon as you boot up your PC.

This lines up with a leak we saw earlier in the month, but not a more recent rumor from last week. Leaker Evan Blass recently claimed the S26 would launch in six colors. Amid a recent blitz of Galaxy S26 rumors and leaks, we’ve heard about color options a couple of times: first in the context of leaked images of the S26 Ultra’s SIM card tray , then in a second rumor that corroborated the colors from that initial leak while claiming the existence of two more. Today, though, we’ve got a conflicting report that lines up with the SIM card tray leak, but doesn’t mention the other colorways we heard about later. Leaker theonecid posted on Twitter today that the Galaxy S26 series will come in four colors: black, white, Cobalt Violet, and Sky Blue. Those are the same colors seen in images of the Ultra model’s SIM tray posted earlier this month by Ice Universe — but today’s post notably lacks the “silver shadow” and “pink gold” colorways leaker Evan Blass claimed would be available on the S26 Ultra last week.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A new tool called PS2Recomp has emerged to create native PC ports of PS2 games. The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access. At the time, we didn’t know exactly what this new UI would look like, whether the favorited passes would be highlighted on the Wallet app’s home screen, or appear directly on the phone’s home screen. Thanks to a recent Google Wallet update, we now have a much better idea of how favoriting passes would work in the new UI.

After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed.

If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before.

You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood.

Not surprisingly, Verizon did not lead in network speed, with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T tied for fastest. Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out. In fact, it is riding relatively high in the latest State of the Mobile Union report from RootMetrics .",

Despite their somewhat legally dubious origins, Android gaming handheld makers have taken a lot of steps toward legitimacy in recent years. The big players, like Retroid, AYN, and AYANEO, don’t ship devices with any copyrighted material, and most now offer some sort of warranty on products. However, that hasn’t stopped scams from popping up in other parts of the web, prompting AYN to send out a warning message this morning. The company writes that it has received reports of unaffiliated websites selling its products online. These range from overpriced resellers to outright scams, and the company warns that it “cannot guarantee any sort of protection if you purchase from non-AYN sites.” The company also notes that only emails from addresses ending in @ayn.hk are official AYN staff members.",

After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel.
