    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

The alternatives may convey slightly different meaning, or offer different levels of formality. Google could introduce this option alongside the “Understand” and “Ask” buttons we saw earlier. Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others. While it sometimes misreports facts, “ hallucinating ” details, it tends to do a pretty decent job at stringing a few words together — even incorrect results don’t end up sounding like gibberish. That makes translation a pretty obvious target for AI’s skill set, and today we’ve spotted what looks like some new AI-powered functionality Google’s working on for its Translate app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

There’s nothing surprising in the render itself, but the timing of the leak does line up nicely with a rumor from earlier this morning pointing to a 10a release in the coming weeks. The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different. The phone in the render is sporting some considerably thick bezels, a notable difference from previous (unofficial) CAD renders, which featured a thinner border around the phone’s display.",

However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed .

AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott.

Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

    "body": "While I use Google Maps even when I’m not navigating , I drove around a bit more during the holiday season and had to rely on the app’s directions to get around. However, this made me acutely aware of its shortcomings when it comes to audio navigation — something I thought that Google would’ve improved by now. When I drive, I mostly rely on Maps’ audio navigation. This is down to a few reasons: I don’t have a smartphone mount that can reliably attach to my car’s vents, I have no built-in dashboard display, and I have to stow my phone away when driving through high-crime areas.",

    "body": "I thought that I had my phone factory reset process down to an art, thanks to the frequency with which I reset and send back review devices. But recently I had to reset an older device — and just before I was about to start the process, I decided to go back and check if it had missed anything important. That’s when I realized it had a few things I actually hadn’t backed up. After all, the data on a temporary or secondary device is generally less important than the data on one that you used as a daily driver. In my case, I was also selling the device, so I didn’t have the option to simply leave it as-is in case I needed to recover something later.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority I love Google Photos; its ease of use and feature set are unrivaled in my opinion. However, I’m an even bigger fan of self-hosting — I use my DIY NAS to replace a considerable range of overpriced subscription services. However, so far, I haven’t been able to replace Google Photos completely, but I might have finally found a way to truly cut the cord. See, I’m loath to fork out for Google One when I have 10TB of hard drive space on my NAS. Still, I use Google Photos to make the occasional quick edit, to help share snaps with friends and family quickly, and even duplicate a few of my most cherished memories as part of the recommended 3-2-1 backup rule . For storing most of my older snaps, I’ve been using PhotoPrism, but as good as it is as a photo library, it lacks the rich feature set of Photos, especially for managing multiple users in my home.",

    "body": "Pixels have always put the “smart” in the word smartphone. They’ve stood for the best of the smart features and AI capabilities the smartphone world has ever seen, and have often led from the front. Compared to the AI features Pixels have been offering for years, like Magic Eraser, Apple Intelligence barely holds ground. I was mighty impressed by the Pixel 10 that launched last year, and I genuinely think it’s a better phone than even the Pro model. Yet, I still feel the Pixel 10 series just wasn’t enough. There’s only so much Google can do to improve the Pixel 10 series through software updates — and to be fair, it does quite a lot. But as we enter 2026, my hopes are firmly placed on the Pixel 11. We still have a few months before the next Pixel launches, but I want to use this time to share my wishlist with Google.",

    "body": "With everything moving to a subscription model and increasing cloud dependence, we are living in the era of the forever tax. Between Spotify, Netflix, and cloud storage, we pay for music, movies, and to keep our own digital memories safe. And while cloud storage started as a convenient utility with fairly minimal charges for an additional 100GB of storage when photos were all we uploaded, that’s not the case anymore. Between years of data archives, larger photo files, and even larger 4K video-first content capture being the norm, for many of us, it has morphed into a significant monthly bill that we aren’t really in a position to cancel. Over here at Android Authority , we’ve talked about Network Attached Storage, or NAS , as a solution for the privacy-conscious or the tech-savvy enthusiasts who want to de-Google their lives and reduce their cloud dependence. We’ve even talked about data sovereignty and actually owning your files in a world that desperately wants you to rent them. But while all that is great, cost is another significant factor to consider. The fact of the matter is that a significant chunk of users considering a local storage option are only trying to reduce their…",
