Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.” Snider’s family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere.

The Aussie rockers, who had been set for a triumphant hometown performance, redirected their entire AU$5,000 performance fee to seven local venues — a gesture that quickly grew into a AU$35,000 bar tab shared across some of the city’s most beloved rooms. According to ABC Australia , the gig was halted after multiple breaches of the security barrier raised concerns about crowd safety. The Melbourne Arts Precinct Corporation said the decision “wasn’t made lightly,” citing risks to the audience, staff, and the band. Fans watching the livestream were stunned as the plug was pulled just eight minutes before showtime.

This summer, Taylor stood inside a packed Rogers Centre watching The Weeknd’s sixth sold-out hometown show. For him, it felt like a full-circle moment. He and Abel Tesfaye met as teenagers in Scarborough, dropped out of school together and built their careers from scratch.
