(Return at 7:00 p.m. ET to watch the full music video). The sweet song — a bachata with bolero elements that expresses the pain and melancholy of a lost love through deeply poetic lyrics — returns 35 years later to unite Guerra&#8217;s celebrated sound with Sting&#8217;s unmistakable artistic sensitivity, with the latter taking on the task of singing entirely in Spanish. &#8220;Juan&nbsp;Luis’ lyrics in &#8216;Estrellitas y Duendes&#8217; are a master class in what one might call romantic magical realism. I had to try to sing them exactly as they were written because they’re impeccable,&#8221; Sting says in a statement to Billboard Español . &#8220;My Spanish pronunciation is hardly perfect, but the spirit in which I sang them is genuine and true.&#8221;&nbsp; For Guerra, this came as a surprise. &#8220;We recorded remotely, and what stood out to me the…",

Now, Spotify’s getting a new feature that offers a little bit of that experience on demand, whenever you want it. In a blog post this morning, Spotify announced that the app is getting a weekly listening stats feature. These weekly stats aren’t delivered in as glossy a package as the once-a-year Wrapped, which comes with a slick multimedia slideshow. Instead, your listening stats highlight which artists and tracks you’ve listened to the most in each seven-day period in a simpler, but still shareable, format.",

Having used it for over two years, I can confirm that it alters — in a good way — how you approach the app drawer. I now install it on all the phones I review and strongly recommend it too. However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update. In July, the developers of the launcher introduced a new theme playground , enabling users to experiment with various clock styles, wallpapers, and colors.

Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department. While the camera itself isn’t receiving any significant upgrades, some of the software features supporting it are expected to improve.

Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but it’s not going to be cheap. One of the most noteworthy shifts in Android gaming handhelds this year has been AYANEO moving away from ultra-premium handhelds with more affordable options like the KONKR Pocket FIT and Pocket AIR Mini, but its latest handheld throws all that to the wind to double down on complete, unnecessary luxury. First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons. It also appears to have an all-glass front, as well as transluscent, unlabeled buttons.",

While US Mobile offers a wide range of features, phone insurance previously wasn’t part of the picture. That’s no longer the case, as today the company announced plans for its Protect service. Even better, US Mobile is celebrating by giving away a free Pixel 10 to the first 100 customers to sign up for the service. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple is reportedly working on a lower-cost Mac laptop that could sell well under $1,000 by using iPhone-class chips and a smaller LCD. The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.
