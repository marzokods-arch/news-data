After all, it's hard not to spread a little joy in the office, or at least to crack a smile yourself, when you're wearing cat ears. Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

There are detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows handheld on Reddit, thanks to user Gogsi123 (via The Verge ). The basic idea, though, is to become a Windows Insider, update to 25H2, and then if you can't see the option in your Settings, you can use ViVeTool to enable the feature (some of you might remember using this tool to enable Copilot features before they officially rolled out in some regions). (Image credit: Future) When I saw the ROG Xbox Ally at Gamescom last month, Asus seemed to pin Microsoft's Xbox Full screen experience as one of the handheld's selling points. Neither Asus nor Microsoft have pretended that the handheld gaming mode would only be for the ROG Xbox Ally, but it was expected we'd only be able to see it when the handheld launches on October 16, with other handhelds sometime after that.

Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item?

This humble plant actually has multiple quests dedicated to it, including a special Act 2 ending you can achieve if you're willing to finish the game with the bud's restrictions active (and I'm not just talking about the screaming). If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy—you can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline. Below, I'll explain where to find the Twisted Bud, how to use it, and then how to remove it once you immediately regret doing that so you can get the Witch Crest. Where to find the Twisted Bud in Silksong You can drop into the part of Bilewater with the Twisted Bud via a secret passage in the top right corner of this room in the Whispering Vaults (Image credit: Team Cherry) You can get the Twisted Bud in a chamber sealed off by roots in the northwest of Bilewater .

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.

Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing.

Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts .

Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.

    "body": "I can check one worry off the list for Battlefield 6: the large maps are, in fact, pretty large. This week I played a few hours of Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm, two maps that Battlefield Studios has been talking up as representative of Battlefield 6's scale. Even though I've played dozens of hours of multiplayer at this point, this Battlefield 6 demo felt personally make-or-break: EA's focus on small maps (and one medium) in the open beta was a letdown, and it helped fuel the impression that it's more interested in converting Call of Duty players than winning back Battlefield long-timers. That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core. Mirak Valley is a spacious, intimidating war zone. The middle lane is a gauntlet of villages and battle-worn trenches that collide at the center in a massive construction site overseen by a precariously placed crane. Sure would be a shame if somebody knocked it over... Nice. Mirak …",

    "body": "Ever since I've been aware of our ranking of the best PC controllers for gaming , the Xbox Wireless Controller has sat atop it. And that's for good reason. With comfortable textured grips, a great feel, a sturdy build, and a classic look, it's still a bit of a banger five years after its Xbox Series X refresh. That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",

The Kickballer fires bouncing projectiles, and when you hit a shot, it'll fire a second one for free, leading to some very high damage numbers and game-breaking visuals. However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it. Don't worry, though, here's how to get this game-breaking shotgun.

But it's probably why, in the first week of release, players have fought bosses 63 million times and defeated 55 million of them. Pretty good hit rate, and the numbers come from developer Gearbox itself, which has released a loot package for all players to celebrate… erm, all the looting. The rewards come in the form of a Shift code, Gearbox's little data-hoovering service that it uses because it can, and is called the Break Free Pack. It includes a vault hunter skin, a legendary ripper shield that scales to your level, and two ECHO-4 drone skins: the code is JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R.

I guess that, and only that, is why I'm not Margot Robbie, who is the one Hollywood has actually tapped to make a The Sims movie for some reason, and whose production company is set to draw inspiration for the project from the Barbie film and the Lego Movie (via The Direct ). That's per one of the film's producers, Roy Lee, who told The Direct that \"Somewhere in-between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be.\" Which, great. Let me read that a few more times to see if I can figure out what it means. Nope, no luck. Okay, let me try to break it down for myself. I think we can take from this that The Sims movie will be something resembling a comedy, probably a family movie rather than a straightforward kids' film, and that its humour will be pretty universal but maybe dip into the more esoteric every now and then—you know, like the bit where Barbie chats about fascism.

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack. It's creative, it's charming, and it genuinely bridges the gap between two wildly different games.

For anyone who's been following that early access journey, the 1.0 release won't come as any startling reinvention.

Well, someone already did and carried out the necessary testing to find out the answer. Phew, we can all rest easy tonight. We can thank user minki over at Lenowo for running these tests. They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box . They then left the game running, which would cause the demo to loop over and over, to see how long it'd take to crash.

They aren't strictly necessary (I'm not sure they all count towards 100% completion), but each one is a challenge you'll want to encounter if you're a completionist. These mementos aren't available until Act 3, mainly because the quests don't spawn, or you don't have the relevant movement abilities like Silk Soar. Below, I'll explain how to get every memento. Obviously, this will contain some spoilers for Act 3 content , though not really in regard to the main story itself.
