The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

It's Divinity —just Divinity—and I'd bet several dollars it's a soft reboot for a series which is going to pull in exponentially more players after the mondo success of Baldur's Gate 3. So if we can't argue about what that statue is or what Larian's next game will be anymore, what's left to us? Fear not: we've already started arguing about whether Divinity will be a turn-based game when it eventually arrives, or if it'll revive the old, hallowed ways of realtime with pause, like its Infinity Engine forefathers of olde. In fact, the debate went on before Divinity was even officially revealed at The Game Awards. \"There are rumors that Larian's next game 'Divinity' is NOT turn-based…\" tweeted content creator SynthPotato .

TerraUSD was a so-called stablecoin for its intrinsic tie to the value of the US dollar. Intended to always be valued at $1 per coin, the foundations of the stablecoin were complex and shaky. It relied on protocols, a separate counter-token called Luna, and an exchange for burning/minting tokens to maintain the price of TerraUSD at $1. Failed attempts to prop up the system and mislead investors using secret funds eventually led to the collapse of both TerraUSD and Luna, from $1 and $87 on May 5, to $0.2 and $0.00005 on May 13 . \"In fact, core Terraform products did not work as Kwon advertised and were manipulated to create the illusion of a functioning and decentralized financial syste…",

Upon watching arcade racer Screamer's latest narrative-focused trailer at The Game Awards, the first thing I thought to myself was, \"Huh, this absolutely feels like a fighting game.\" A tournament bringing unlikely individuals together in the pursuit of a larger, evil entity? Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters.

A game developed as the PC's answer to Namco's Ridge Racer before its sequel delved more into rally racing. The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning. But I can assure you that we have decided to do this while keeping in mind the essence of the original Screamer, which was a very fast racing game with a lot of adrenaline in it, in every race.

But it looks positively sick, and I had to do a double take to realize it's a follow up to one of the biggest games of the past few years. Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding. Before things fade to black, we get the disturbing sight of some kind of zombified half-torso thing emerging from the water. \"Do I have to have played Forest 1 and Forest 2 to get Forest 3?\" I quipped to the PC Gamer work chat.

Almost nothing has been left untouched over the course of its seasonal updates and system overhauls. But with the launch of its next expansion, I think its era of constant reworks will finally be over. On April 28, its second expansion, Lord of Hatred, will launch and bring with it a new campaign, a new region to explore, two new classes (including paladins ), and several features players have been asking for since the game came out. They're the kind of things that simply wouldn't work in the game it used to be. A great example of this are loot filters, which are finally coming in Lord of Hatred. I'll admit, I used to be against the idea given how important churning through loot is in Diablo games. But with the changes to items in the current season and the new ways to craft gear into exactly what you want, I'm sold on the ability to sort your items before you even pick them up.

Paladins won't be the only new class coming with Lord of Hatred, however. Blizzard says there's one more that will launch with the expansion, but it's keeping it a secret for now. \"The paladin is our knight, is our holy warrior. It's our sword and board class that is empowered by their faith,\" senior combat designer Dominick Sileo says in a video Blizzard provided to PC Gamer. A blend of Diablo 2's paladin and Diablo 3's crusader, the Diablo 4 paladin has four distinct fighting styles split up into different oaths you can choose from.

But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain.

Rockstar denied allegations that it fired the employees because they were attempting to form a union at the studio, saying initially that they were let go for \"gross misconduct,\" which it later elaborated to mean they had been \" distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\" That denial didn't hold water with the fired employees and the Independent Workers' of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which filed legal action against Rockstar in November. November also saw the matter brought up in UK Parliament , as Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine asked for a meeting with the relevant government minister \"to discuss what steps could be taken to support the workforce?\" The pressure on Rockstar went up significantly yesterday when the matter was raised in Parliament again, this time during Prime Minister's Questions, le…",

In a video published earlier today , Capcom outlined the additions coming in the final major Wilds update, including the returning elder dragon Gogmazios, new weapon and armor upgrade systems, and—crucially—improvements for the performance issues that have tarnished the game's reputation so badly that Capcom's own investors are using Wilds as shorthand for performance concerns. Unfortunately, PC hunters will once again have to wait to see the full extent of the performance fixes Capcom has been promising since July . While Capcom says the Title Update 4 launch will implement multi-platform optimization improvements, additional performance fixes specific to the PC version won't arrive until January in a follow-up patch. (Image credit: Capcom) Capcom's TU4 showcase included a more detailed schedule of its planned performance and stability improvements. Title Update 4, Capcom said, will improve CPU and GPU performance on all platforms by \"optimizing processing time through adjustments to frame processing, collision detecti…",

Well, Nick Valentine's my favourite anyway. PCG's Ted Litchfield interviewed Bethesda's design director Emil Pagliarulo who, with Thief's Garrett as the launching point, went into detail on the early stages of Fallout 4, when the game was set in New York (it would end up being set in Boston). \"Stephen Russell was the first actor I ever wrote dialog for back in Thief,\" says Pagliarulo, referencing synth gumshoe Nick Valentine's voice actor. \"He was a character that I created. He was in the very first design document that I ever wrote for Fallout 4, when it was set in New York.

The whole point of the mode, Blizzard says, is wild, frenetic fun: getting super powerful and collecting every transmog armor appearance, pet, mount, and toy an expansion offers in a short period of time. But the decisions the company makes about the mode, including the most recent update, are often not in support of that goal. Players level up their strength so fast and so far in Remix that they're ridiculously overpowered, tackling even the toughest group content in the game solo, romping through old dungeons and raids as if they were new-player zones. In the current Legion Remix, players are called Timerunners, and the same buff they build up to become OP levelers and fighters also gives them a speed buff—they literally dash everywhere they go. So far, so good. Go fast! But not that fast (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) But even when the first Mists of Pandaria Remix debuted last year, there were signs of trouble on the horizon.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.
