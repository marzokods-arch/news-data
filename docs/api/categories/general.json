Across the bottom of the image is the phrase that appears to be the title of her upcoming single, &#8220;Eyes Closed,&#8221; which is accompanied by another tantalizing tease in the caption, &#8220;a duet is near.&#8221; At press time no release date or additional information on who JISOO may be dueting with on the track was available.
