In fact, only one feature has been revealed so far, and much like the Spring to Life drop from March 2025, it will change the appearance of mobs we're so used to seeing. Yes, it's baby mobs . But even though we've only seen this one feature so far, it's still worth getting excited about—especially if you're an avid farmer or general animal lover and tend to spend more time with the mobs in the overworld rather than the monsters underground. Here's everything you need to know about Minecraft's first update for 2026. When will the Minecraft baby mob update release? There is no concrete release date for the first Minecraft drop for 2026, though it's safe to assume it will roll out this spring.

Now, breaking ground on a new fab to actually manufacture memory chips might be a bit beyond the wit of even the most enthusiastic DIY'er. But where there's a will... The modder, who goes by the handle VIK-on, used a pair of 16 GB DDR5 laptop SODIMMs as a starting point. The next step was to source a compatible PCB with the aim of combining all 32 GB onto a single homebrew DIMM. Reportedly, the total cost of the build was $218, about a third of the going rate in Russia for a 32 GB DDR5 stick. Nice. VIK-on also looked into using even cheaper 8 GB sticks to source memory chips, but it seems the chip packaging raises problems when it comes to creating 32 GB sticks.

Nick Pechenin, head of design at the studio, said that its take on the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset informed a lot of how Divinity's shaping up. \"We went through our original ideas for DoS1 and DoS2,\" Pechenin writes , \"Looked again at how they worked out in practice, picked up some inspirations from our BG3 EA and post-release journey, consulted the star charts to see what we need to do to stay competitive—and cooked a new action economy and character progression system.\" As for what that action economy and character progression system looks like, I can only make guesses at this point. Which is fair, works in progress are, indeed, works in progress . It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement). While DoS2 was also crowd-control heavy, you also had a bunch of action points to spend—which, via certain abilities, could be refreshed, allowing for some …",

    "body": "It's no secret that major studios are struggling to put out successful games. Between increasing development turnarounds, ballooning budgets, cancellations and mass layoffs, the industry is finding it harder to reliably bring projects to conclusion, leading to fewer blockbusters coming out each year. Various reasons have been aired for these problems, ranging from overeager profit chasing, to mismanagement and the malign influence of private equity, alongside broader market influences like audiences playing fewer new games . But former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio thinks the problems are more fundamental than these influences. Indeed, he believes they go right to the heart of how gaming's biggest studios are currently structured. Speaking to GamesIndustry, Amancio, who directed both Assassin's Creed: Unity and Assassin's Creed: Revelations , said that the sheer size of modern development teams makes both sustainability and innovation extremely difficult: \"There's this theory that says whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it.

Things picked up speed toward the end of the year, however, with a major patch arriving in December that introduced a rework to core systems and an overhaul to castle construction. It seems Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse are keen to maintain that momentum in 2026. In a Steam update , Hooded Horse's CEO Tim Bender provided a detailed rundown of what's coming to the management sim this year. The most immediate planned change is a new upgrade level for the Burgage Plot—Manor Lords' basic homestead that can be expanded and tailored to a variety of uses. Burgage plots currently have three upgrade levels, but Slavic Magic is adding a new level, which exists between 2 and 3. \"Its goal is to more smoothly bridge the gap between early and late-game housing\", Bender explains. Alongside this, Slavic Magic is also considering shifting certain workshop progressions to later in the game, tying baker extensions to level 3 Burgage Plots to encourage use of the early-game communal oven, and also doing the same with cobbler ext…",

As Gamesradar noted in its report on this, there's a video on YouTube where games marketing consultant Chris Zukowski talks about Valve's coveted \"chocolate tier\": a special class of studios that, once they get up to around $800,000 in annual revenue, receive a box of fancy chocolates as a gift from Valve at the end of the year. That Gamesradar article mentions an interview Game File (readers may encounter a paywall) conducted with Peak developer Aggro Crab. Co-founder Nick Kaman confirmed Aggro Crab has been itching to join the chocolate-chowing inner circle since it released Another Crab's Treasure , its most successful game before Peak. The team didn't receive a gift from Valve in 2024 despite pulling in the right amount of cash from that game, which stung; when Kaman emailed Valve about it, he got an apology.

At this point, Slork had been renamed to the decidedly less hilarious Fathom. Deadlock has spent the last year shifting forms like the MOBA version of an Animorph, and the hero labs mode was removed as the game became increasingly polished and all play was subsumed into a single ranked queue.

This problem came to a head last year, with Riot promising to cut back on supplementary utility powers to reorient Valorant back around gunplay.

That new gun is called the Bandit, a semiautomatic pistol designed to fill the gap between the silenced Ghost and Valorant's high-powered revolver, the Sheriff. The Bandit gives players a higher rate of fire than the Sheriff and superior damage compared to the Ghost, able to deal instant kills on headshots against lightly armoured players.

Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds.
