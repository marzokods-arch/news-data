Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to enjoy the game for yourself, as Petscop went unreleased, unfinished, and largely exists today as one of the more mysterious creepypastas floating around strange corners of the internet. For all its weirdness, it's a game I wish I could've experienced firsthand with zero warning. (Image credit: AndyLand) In steps Endacopia. Apart from being a point-and-click horror game, I don't really understand what's going on in Endacopia most of the time, which is entirely the point and why it feels so close to a Petscop spiritual successor.

For this, I blame the many Vampire: The Masquerade 2nd edition books I somehow came to own when I was, like, 12 or something. I've no idea what the TTRPG of Vampire is like to actually play, but I admit I loved the lore, which got ever more absurd with every new sourcebook. Now, you too can experience this unparalleled joy: the latest Humble book bundle is a collection of 54 World of Darkness ebooks (in PDF form) spanning the Vampire, Werewolf, and Hunter series. Mathematics tells us that's quite a lot of books, but economics tells us that, fair play, they're not all that expensive. The entire 57-item bundle (that's the 54 books plus three sets of bonus materials) will set you back $25 (£18.54) . You can nab a cheaper 27-item bundle—which nixes the core rulebooks and several of the newer sourcebooks—is $15 (£11.12) .

But maybe I've been missing out, because it turns out that if you determinedly skip through the cutscenes in Baby Steps —Bennett Foddy, Gabe Cuzzillo, and Maxi Boch's putting-one-foot-in-front-of-another simulator—you unlock an entire, brilliant bonus cutscene. Or punishment cutscene, depending on how you feel about the whole thing. As showcased by YouTuber Cuttyflame , successfully skipping \"around 30\" or so of the game's cutscenes—harder than it sounds: skipping cutscenes requires passing an ever-more-complex series of minigames—will eventually lead protagonist Nate to straightforwardly give up on trying to act out cutscenes towards the game's end. Rather than, you know, do a proper cutscene, Nate and chill donkey-guy Moose will acknowledge the player's lack of interest in their narrative, sit down, drop character, and embark on a cutscene that puts even Kojima to shame. What proceeds is effectively a 28-minute podcast between Nate actor Gabe Cuzzillo and Moose actor Be…",

No matter how hard I try, it gets to a certain point where I just cannot go on anymore and turn back to my base. I can blame my depleting oxygen and inability to ever craft water breathing potions, but it's actually because it just feels long and unrewarding. Even when I know there's a shipwreck or temple, I will simply not go on the expedition. Minecraft's next drop, Mounts of Mayhem , provides a failsafe way to explore the ocean however, and I'm not sure I can get away with this anymore. Rather than having to rely on potions and your own ability to swim, the Nautilus will make the process of navigating the waves so much easier. These underwater mobs can be tamed with pufferfish before being saddled up and ridden by the player. Not only are they a decent escape option for any encounters with Drowned or Guardians thanks to their fast movement speed, they also completely bypass the fear of losing all your oxygen with the new \"Breath of the Nautilus\" effect.

For context: In the Borderlands 4 post-game, there's a vendor called Maurice's Black Market , a vending machine that changes location every week and sells a number of legendaries that are rolled on a per-player basis. However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds. It's a so-so system—it can be disappointing to rush to your own personal Maurice box, only to find out that none of the rolls are useful—but Pitchford does make a solid argument that this system lets communities band together to share their rolls and pick a buddy to skim good legendary weapons off.

New traits, utility skills and an overhaul of the base profession mechanic means entire new builds for players to try. \"We definitely figured out that we wanted to do elite specs pretty early,\" says Cal Cohen, senior game designer for Guild Wars 2, in an interview with PC Gamer. Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed. And usually elite specs can also fill a couple of different roles. So whenever we can do elite specs, I think we want to do elite specs.\" The new set of elite specs, which are launc…",

For fans of GTA Online , the alien gang wars of 2020 live long in the memory. For Fortnite aficionados, who could forget Travis Scott's jaw-dropping in-game Astronomical event? One scripted, one very-much-not, but two watershed moments in open-world games this decade. Now, as we slouch slowly but surely towards GTA 6 (on console, at least; a PC launch date still lingers in the ether) and the promise of whatever shape its own online offshoot might take, the idea of balancing the invented with the inadvertent excites me to no end. With that in mind, low-key Rockstar partnerships dance at the forefront of my imagination. Wheels of steel (Image credit: Rockstar/Traderrjoe) You see, no matter how well-executed Rockstar's blockbuster GTA Online updates have been in more recent years, there's something brilliant about its most unhinged but unplanned moments on the streets of San Andreas. The game's servers can be harrowing places with infuriating hackers and hoverbike griefers lurking above and below, but sessions often shine in their bouts of unscripted second-t…",

But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, GameStop announced, \"We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online.\" A photo included in the post adds, \"You're welcome.\" We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online. pic.twitter.com/EAPGaud7cY October 1, 2025 How exactly GameStop is able to continue offering Game Pass Ultimate at the old price is unclear. What is clear is that GameStop is listening to the complaints about the price hike. In contrast, Microsoft is reportedly attempting to smooth things over by considering a free, ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming . Gamers canceled their Game Pass subscriptions in droves when the price increases were announced earlier this week, the most egregious of which was the new $29.99 per month rate for Game Pass Ultimate. Even Game Pass PC …",

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . There's a good chance you haven't heard of The Wheel of Time. No, not the beloved series of fantasy novels penned by Robert Jordan, or the less beloved but still pretty good TV show cancelled by Amazon, or the recently announced and preposterously ambitious RPG . I am of course referring to the other Wheel of Time , the first-person spell-slinger developed by Legend Entertainment and released in 1999. The Wheel of Time was praised by critics when it launched, partly due to its association with the popular series of fantasy novels, but equally due to its decent singleplayer campaign and innovative multiplayer mode. Despite this, it sold poorly, fading quickly amid the torrent of first-person shooters that rushed across shelves in the late nineties.

I love that it's like a special sauce you can mix with countless other genres to create bold new flavours—from card games, to bullet hell, to survival, to RTS, and more. That's why I've put together a quiz testing my fellow fans on their knowledge of roguelikes. All you have to do is check out the screenshots, and type in the name of the game for each one—within a two-minute time limit, naturally. I had to make it difficult, of course—that's only being faithful to the genre, right? Don't worry, if you lose, you can always start again. Before anyone rushes to the comments with a \"Well, actually\" in hand—we're going by the broad, modern definition of roguelikes here. We don't need to get into a debate about roguelikes vs roguelites, and we're definitely taking it as read that the genre includes more than just decades-old turn-based dungeon crawlers. So be prepared for a wide variety of very different games below, testing your knowledge across the whole roguelike spectrum. But do rush to the comments to let us know your scores! We want to know how you did—and which of the 20 games below is your favourite.",

    "body": "Civilization 7 received a beefy update this week, as Firaxis continues to work on its latest and most divisive entry in its series of historical 4Xs. Update 1.2.5 brings a host of tweaks and adjustments, shuffling maps, improving the UI, and expanding strategic options around city-states. Plus, like a certain Duke who gave his name to a certain rubber footwear, it also gives Napoleon a proper sorting out. Map generation is the primary target of update 1.2.5, with Firaxis responding to complaints that the sequel's landmasses were predictable and dull. To fix the issue, Firaxis says it has \"started from scratch and created a new base algorithm for making maps\" in Civ, while simultaneously introducing two extra map types. \"Continents and Islands\" serves as the new map default for single-player, mixing up larger and smaller landmasses of various sizes, while \"Pangaea and Islands\" situates the bulk of the action on one giant geographical inkblot, with splashes of separate terrain in and around it. As for those aforementioned UI improvements, these focus primarily on settlement development. The changes provide more detailed upfront information on the production menu, add clearer yield i…",
