    "body": "Borderlands 4 is in a tough place when it comes to tone. The over-reliance on literal toilet humor in Borderlands 3 was so universally disliked that a follow-up was always going to pare it back a bit. Which Borderlands 3 does, though sometimes too much. The villains in particular end up feeling like personality-free zones, some of them not even having enough going on to fill the empty space on their introductory title cards. They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme. My favorite so far is Forgive Me, a quest based on a viral joke about the storytelling in Soulsborne games—a joke tweeted by Borderlands 4 head writer Sam Winkler back in 2022. (Image credit: Sam Winkler) Because the internet is the way it is, Winkler ended up having to explain in the replies that he actually likes FromSoftware games, saying, \"I am begging anyone who thinks I'm dunking on fromsoft to learn how to make fun of the things you love\".

If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work.

Both Hollow Knights are deliciously old school in how they make you work for your double jump, withholding it until deep into the game. In Silksong, the Faydown Cloak is located at the top of Mount Fay, past a challenging, platforming-centric level that requires the Clawline, an Act 2 ability. At least, it's supposed to require the Clawline. For the skip, Cofy needed: The Needolin Swift Step Reaper Crest Drifter's Cloak Sharpdart This is already nuts because the Sharpdart itself is designed to require the Faydown Cloak to grab⁠—it's a Catch 22. But Cofy also has a guide showing the requisite jumping tech to get the Sharpdart before the Faydown Cloak . Sharpdart is a dash attack that Cofy is able to use as a poor man's Clawline during the climb.

Skong Boss Doubler has no such concessions to fun play, it's just \"There are two Last Judges now. Good luck. Champions adjust.\" But it's a really, really funny bit, part of the back and forth conversation between players, modders, and memers over this game.

He went on to add that, \"Technology and console aside, our workflows and the way we built our worlds throughout each iteration, for Forza Horizon 6 [we took] lots of learnings from past games.\" One of the \"past games\" that influenced Horizon 6 most was (somewhat surprisingly) the Hot Wheels DLC for Horizon 5, as Arceta explained: \"We actually developed a new way to create those orange tracks that go around the road to get the best quality and have it be authentic [to Hot Wheels].

It's unmistakably inspired by the Zelda games, but it still has its own sense of style and place thanks to the wonderfully designed characters. One mysterious figure has dark antlers and eyes filled in white, another's face is wrapped up in a head scarf, with only a long eyelash and serpentine eye exposed, and another is some sort of mouse mage. As well as richly-colored landscapes and locales, we get a look at the action-heavy combat, too. Our hero can rapidly dodge out of the way of incoming attacks and deliver their own flurry of deadly follow-up strikes. The enemies look like a real challenge.

You can't just trek endlessly: you need to rest, eat, and stay warm. There's also a clip of a traveller stopping for a rest in a cave, so you can use natural shelters to protect you from the elements, too. In the combat montage, even smaller enemies pose a challenge. Outward 2 isn't a game where they'll wait in an orderly circle and attack one by one; they just take advantage of their numbers if they have them.

Of course, you don't play as the cult's true head honcho in Join Us; you're a franchise owner of sorts, building a personalized wing of a much larger doomsday cult in the rural United States. You'll build a remote compound, conceal yourself from local scrutiny, and recruit the psychologically vulnerable who you can detect with target-highlighting \"leader vision.\" It's like Batman's detective sight from the Arkham games, but for emotional manipulation.

But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world.

The twist is that it also throws in co-op and some mechanical elements à la Satisfactory. As you can see in the trailer, there are cute robots that will work the land with you, and also machines you can build and pipes you can connect to help you keep up with all the labor that goes into maintaining a proper farm. It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears. Another feature that's just been announced is that Farmbotic will be launching with crossplay, so you won't need to disown any friends who choose to get it on PS5 or Xbox. People lucky enough to attend the Tokyo Game Show in person already got a chance to go hands-on with Farmbotic, but the rest of us will have to wait until it launches…",

Pair him up with Swery65 of Deadly Premonition fame and you get Hotel Barcelona, a stylish, violent, side-scrolling roguelite about a woman staying in a haunted hotel possessed by a murderer. The basic premise of the game is that you play as Justine, a US Marshall possessed by the spirit of a killer, and you need to fight your way out of a hotel where seven of the deadliest murderers in the country reside. Contributing to the roguelite flair is your ability to have past iterations of yourself join you in future escape attempts, and they can do damage and distract foes. Kind of like a ghost in Mario Kart if it could throw shells at you. In an interview shown during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, Swery65 explains how he landed on the style and genre for Hotel Barcelona. He says he looked back to the beginning of his career to add that old-school \"hardcore spirit\" to it, emulating the arcade games he and his mentors cut their teeth on. Also discussed during the interview is how many of the game’s ideas came to be in the first …",

This is a PvEvP experience, so you'll have to contend with deadly robots as well as other players going after the same loot you are. There's some bullet hell-style chaos here. One of the enemies fires streams of creeping, malevolent orbs as well as missile-like projectiles that shoot straight up in the air before heading right for you on a diagonal. I might have to bust out the protractor to avoid getting hit. We also see an arena where circles of electricity force you to dance around them lest you get zapped. Luckily, you have a variety of weapons to deal with these foes: From shotguns and sniper rifles—where each pellet causes its own number to pop up above an enemy's head, fantastic—to assault rifles and pistols. There's a free public play test for Gravebound that starts right now. So,…",

Kiwami 3 isn't like the other remakes of the older games in the series, according to Yokoyama, who we spoke to during a visit to RGG headquarters in Japan. \"Instead of simply adding mini-games or extra story content, we've added an entirely new, standalone game called Dark Ties,\" he said. \"This allows players to experience the story from a completely new perspective as a different protagonist.\" Dark Ties is included with Yakuza Kiwami 3, and stars Yoshitaka Mine, a character from Yakuza 3 who was once a businessman but has turned to a life of crime.

Sadly Bully 2 was cancelled way back in 2009 , and given how long it's taken Rockstar to make Grand Theft Auto 6 , it seems unlikely that they'd spare any resources for a Bully sequel. We do, however, have an explanation from Rockstar's cofounder as to why Bully 2 never saw the light of day. Speaking to IGN at LA Comic Con (via Eurogamer ), Dan Houser explained that the project ended prematurely due to a lack of \"bandwidth\" among Rockstar management. \"I think it was just bandwidth issues, Houser told IGN. \"You know, if you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want.\" It's a fairly broad explanation, but it falls roughly in line with previously stated reasons for Bully 2's.

Billie can fly on a broomstick just like a witch, and can use an umbrella to glide gracefully like Mary Poppins. But that's not all, she can run along walls as though she's the Prince of Persia, and uses an assortment of gadgets to get through each level, like bombs, swords, and some sort of projectile launcher—it looks like the umbrella refashioned to shoot gusts of compressed air. There's still more. Billie can also turn invisible and slide around on water by turning it to ice right as she steps on it. I'm excited to see what kind of platforming challenges will be on offer.

One of these is a timid squirrel that Moomintroll finds scurrying about in the attic. As we see during the trailer above, he runs out into the frosty world, following the squirrel's tracks and telling them it's okay to stay inside where it's nice and warm. I love the art style—it looks like you're playing through an old Disney movie like 101 Dalmatians or Bambi.
