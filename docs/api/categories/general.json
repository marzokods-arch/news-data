Similar to the mainline games, the objective is to take down the machines, but this time you'll do so as a fully customizable \"machine hunter\" in an open world inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\". It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

Dogs are great, and it's a scientifically proven fact that any game can be improved by a factor of 90% by simply adding a dog to it—and that rises to 99% when you can pet that dog. But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

Worse, the Steam Deck took more than two years. But never fear: No such antipodean delay is in the cards for Valve's new line-up. Here's confirmation straight from Valve: \"All three products will ship in all the same regions we currently ship Steam Deck (US, CA, UK, EU, AU ) as well as regions covered by Komodo: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\" None have a specific release date nor price at the moment anywhere in the world, but are targeting early 2026. \"Specific launch timing and pricing to be shared sometime after the first of the year,\" Valve writes.

This time, a trademark for the name 'Steam Frame' gave away the Deckard project's real name ahead of our visit, but Deckard rumours have been rife for years. Some more accurate than others, but generally not miles off when you piece it all together. But is this some sort of clever scheme by Valve to drum up support or test out the popularity of ideas on dedicated fans? No, apparently not. That's right from the horse's mouth, too, and if you take this as further proof of some sort of grand plan, I have a bridge to sell you. Stood in a room surrounded by Valve engineers that drew the short straw in having to talk to press, I raised the question, how do they feel when someone gets near-definitive proof of something like the Steam Frame early?

It's a big power move by the Steam team, and one of the first to congratulate them was none other than Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft's gaming division. \"Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms,\" Spencer wrote on X . \"Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start. \"As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere.

These chips from AMD and Intel are the dominant player in PC gaming, so it only makes sense as to why. But in recent months, Arm support is seeping into Steam in a variety of ways. SteamOS will receive Arm support with the launch of the Steam Frame sometime next year. I don't suspect you'll be able to take that ISO file and load it onto any old Arm-based device right away, like a modern mobile phone, and have it just work. It's still not possible to stick SteamOS on any gaming PC and have it just work, but it is improving in that regard. The chip powering the Steam Frame isn't unique to the headset, however.

I can finally let those frustrating memories go—Raccoin's machines will let me win, and win spectacularly. The structure is simple—each round, I get a certain number of coin drops (which I can aim rather more precisely than with a real machine) and have to try and reach that round's target score. That score translates to prize tickets, and between rounds I can tip the odds in my favour by spending them on special coins, power-ups, and passive bonuses. It's a very simple thrill at first. I go for the obvious boons and chuck …",

That's a big ol bold statement to open with, but the Orbital Pathfinder is unlike anything I've ever tested. I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be. To what's right for them. It started with custom PCs, moved on to keyboards, and is now spilling over into almost every area imaginable in this humble little hobby of ours. This isn't the first time we've seen custom mice; ones with swappable plates and grips have existed before the Pathfinder, but no other comes even close to matching what Orbital provides with this setup. It's utterly astonishing. Is this the best wireless gaming mouse of 2025? Honestly? Probably. There are so many ways of customizing it, of tailoring it to exactly how you want it to function, that if it isn't perfect for you, you probably just hav…",

There's plenty of toga cosplay to go around as you slip into the sandals of a Roman governor at the peak of the empire, managing the needs of your people against the demands of the emperor. There's more of a narrative going on in Anno 117 than your average city builder as well, which is a nice touch. Our Anno 117: Pax Romana review says, \"At times it borders on so friendly and non-threatening to your endeavours that you feel like you could leave it unattended for an hour and return to find everything absolutely fine. At others, the sequence of events required to tick off the next chapter objective feels so long and incremental that you wonder if you’ll achieve anything at all of note this evening with it.\" When is the Anno 117 unlock time?

As PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown said in his review , the \"good, sometimes even great\" bite 'em up \"is a sequel in name only, and it never really enthusiastically embraces being an RPG.\" Regardless, developer The Chinese Room has begun updating the game with fixes and features as teased in a roadmap that debuted in a blog post today. Today's patch, which kicks off the roadmap schedule, includes some welcome polish: a save on exit feature, a crash fix, and two dozen or so assorted bug fixes. The rest of the roadmap stretches beyond a Christmas-themed winter update and into next year, though it's a little light on details; there's a Valentine's Day update, and two DLCs due for the latter part of 2026. In the meantime, the future looks a bit scant. The next major patch will pack a few features that, while nice, aren't exactly glamorous points on a roadmap.

So credit where it's due to Agefield High for finally identifying that niche, even if I'm not convinced by how it's going about filling it. Set in 2002, Agefield High: Rock the School sees you play as Sam, a new student looking to make friends, win over his dream girl, and generally leave his mark on the school social hierarchy. Like Rockstar's 2006 game, Agefield High is set in a school campus and a surrounding slice of open-ended suburbia, with a day/night cycle and a school itinerary you can choose to follow or flaunt. Developer Refugium Games just released a new trailer, showing off in-game cutscenes and mechanics like Sam getting into fistfights, riding a bicycle around town and, well, that's about it, to be honest. The Steam page says the game will feature 32 main missions and 15 side missions/activities, and mentions you can buy things like \"bikes, clothes, hairstyles\" and \"dirty magazines\" but doesn't go into all that…",

Even so, when I first heard the murmurings of Rogue and Gambit joining Marvel Rivals, I had already resigned myself to the fact that Gambit would probably be a Duelist and NetEase would try and push Rogue into a Vanguard or Strategist role as compensation. But I was wrong, and I couldn't be happier. Gambit's official character reveal trailer is out, and with it comes the information that NetEase has assigned him to the role of Strategist. His primary fire can heal allies and damage enemies, like most hitscan Strategists. Other abilities include his ultimate, which boosts allies, providing them with a supercharged jump, health regen, and explosive attacks. Then there are his dashes and Bo staff attack that damages enemies and heals allies when smashing it into the ground, exactly like Overwatch 2's latest hero, Wuyang.

Those looking to save some money on a gaming processor are usually well-served by a fast-clocked six-core chip, and AMD's reasonably-priced contender has, until now at least, fit the bill perfectly. What it's missing, however, is a good dose of 3D V-Cache. This has been AMD's ace up its sleeve for a while now, a stacked layer of extra L3 cache that many games love to take advantage of. We've seen its effectiveness when implemented on some of our favourite AM4 gaming processors of old, and it's also turned up in a more recent Zen 4 chip, the Ryzen 5 7600X3D, and the Zen 5-based Ryzen 7 9800X3D , our pick as the best gaming CPU overall. The trouble is, 3D V-Cache-equipped AM5 chips are usually quite pricey. Those looking for a properly sub-$300 beastie with AMD's game-crunching cache tech (the 7600X3D has an MSRP of $299, and usually retails for a lot higher than that) have traditionally had to make do with chips built for the previous-gen AM4 socket, like the Ryzen 5 5700X3D .
