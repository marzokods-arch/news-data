During their trainee days, the 13 members trained together in a cramped studio — sometimes clashing, sometimes supporting one another — before finally debuting as a unified team in May 2015. To ensure that each member’s individual charm could shine, they adopted a distinctive three-unit structure: the Vocal Team (Woozi, Jeonghan, Joshua, DK, Seungkwan), the Hip-Hop Team (S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, Vernon), and the Performance Team (Hoshi, Jun, The8, Dino). Of course, what always came first was SEVENTEEN’s teamwork as 13 members. But it’s undeniable that the Performance Team, in charge of the group’s choreography and stage presence, the Vocal Team, led by producer Woozi and carrying the melodies of SEVENTEEN’s songs, and the Hip-Hop Team, adding a free-spirited vibe, are what make SEVENTEEN such a dynamic group.&nbsp; SEVENTEEN have also pursued notable unit projects. The three-member unit BSS released two single albums, while Hoshi X Woozi — leaders of the Performance and Vocal Teams — dropped their first single album BEAM earlier this year and successfully wrapped up a fan concert tour.

The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

Google appealed to the Supreme Court after this decision and also separately filed for a stay until its appeal is decided.

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

The recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 looks promising on paper, and Qualcomm seems poised for another successful year, securing its place among top Android flagships once again. Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance.
