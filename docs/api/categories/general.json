This becomes the Puerto Rican artist’s 19th music video as a lead, featured artist or collaborator. He also rises to No. 3 on the weekly US Top Artists YouTube chart.&nbsp; A track off his blockbuster Un Verano Sin Tí album, the dembow-heavy banger peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in Oct. 15, 2022 and spent 14 weeks atop. In the music video, filmed by his longtime director Stillz in New York City, Bad Bunny perfectly captures the song’s “YOLO” sentiment, bringing to life its lyrics about a person who likes to date around and doesn’t want to settle down.&nbsp; It starts off with a boy being rejected by the girl he likes, then shows him enjoying the single life, and hooking up with girls, all before he gets kidnapped and forced to marry. In honor of the artist’s first all-out dembow track, the video also pays homage to Dominican culture, showing scenes at a local barbershop and the bodega (corner neighborhood shop). “It’s a song that was born very spontaneously,” Bad Bunny said back in 2023 . “All of the…",

We first previewed this update late last year, and it’s now generally available. Back in October, we got an early look at a new device setup workflow in Google Home. The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Google is changing how mobile security works with the new Intrusion Detection feature , which helps you see exactly what happened if someone gains access to your device. This feature is now rolling out to some devices, months after it was first announced, and it could make a big difference for anyone concerned about compromised accounts. Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time. Now, it’s showing up on devices with Android 16, like the OnePlus Pad 3 , as spotted by our colleague AssembleDebug. A Pixel user on Reddit also reported that the feature is live on their phone with Android 16 QPR2.",

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Update: January 22, 2026 (3:08 AM ET): Android Authority has since been in direct contact with the affected user, who has shared documentation with us. We’ve reviewed the local fire department report, which confirms a thermal runaway event, as well as written communication showing Samsung has offered compensation covering the phone, medical expenses, cleanup costs, and a separate pain-and-suffering amount. This confirms that the incident did occur as described and that Samsung has made the compensation offer described in the original Reddit post. We’ve also reached out to Samsung US for a comment on the matter.",

This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month. T-Mobile updated its bill breakdown support page (via Droid-Life ) to reflect the new prices.",

Earlier this month, shadow library Anna’s Archive, infamous for scraping 300TB of Spotify’s most played songs , suddenly lost its main .org domain. At the time, the site’s operator downplayed the situation, saying that domain takedowns for sites like theirs happen often .

Today, YouTube announced that it’s lifting more restrictions on the feature with an update in the near future. The announcement came in a blog post detailing YouTube ‘s priorities for the year. The post doesn’t get into specifics, only saying that this new “fully customizable multiview” is coming soon.",

In addition to desktop support for Android, Linux Debian, and Windows 11, there’s full mobile compatibility, including a custom Windows UI. Shipments are expected to get started in Q3 2026, with the hardware going for a reasonably affordable $549. Ever since smartphones started getting really powerful, some of us have been wondering why we need so many other computers in our lives. Instead of a smartphone, plus a laptop, and maybe even a desktop computer at home, couldn’t we have this one convenient, portable handset just act as our primary computing device, and connect it to larger screens, keyboards, and mice as we liked? Companies have been trying to offer just that sort of experience for well over a decade now — to varying degrees of success — and now we’re checking out the latest attempt from Nex Computer: the NexPhone .

That said, there are some new details rumored for the Galaxy S26 Ultra that could make it desirable to some users, whether they are using an older Samsung device or looking to switch from another phone brand. Irrespective of what we say, Samsung is already preparing to sell a boatload of Galaxy S26 Ultra units. It reportedly plans to produce roughly 3.6 million units for sale in the first wave after launch. Of course, not all upgrades will appeal equally to every buyer, and we want you to tell us which ones excite you.",

However, when your flagship Pixel doesn’t have a feature that another brand already offers, it’s not unrealistic to hope that Google will introduce it to its own lineup sooner rather than later. With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",

A previous leak implied the phones would shift the cutout to the left corner of the display. The phones are likely to be released this September. Yesterday, we saw a leak that said Apple’s next flagship phone, the iPhone 18 Pro, might tuck its Face ID sensor under the display, in the process shrinking the now-trademark Dynamic Island cluster and shifting it to the left. Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

Bixby hasn’t seemed like much of a priority for Samsung lately, but it looks like that’s changing with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Earlier this morning, Samsung announced a beta for the latest version of its assistant, “upgraded to operate as a conversational device agent” that leverages Perplexity to answer complex questions. Samsung, oddly enough, has since removed its announcement, with its URL currently pointing to a Page not found error. According to the announcement’s text as preserved by Droid Life , the new Bixby will let you control your device’s settings and features by making requests in natural language. For questions about topics other than your phone itself, Bixby will connect to Perplexity to pull info from the web.",

Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears.
