The new production presents a symphonic and operatic reimagining of the band’s 1995 double album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and marked a defining moment in the group’s commercial peak. Across the evening, selections including “Tonight, Tonight,” “1979,” and “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” were transformed for a full operatic cast and orchestra. Corgan appeared as a featured vocalist throughout the performance, joined by soprano Sydney Mancasola, mezzo-soprano Zoie Reams, tenor Dominick Valdés Chenes and baritone Edward Parks. The Lyric Opera Orchestra and Chorus performed under conductor James Lowe, who has been one of Corgan’s key collaborators in reworking the score for the stage. In a previous statement, Corgan said the process allowed him to reconsider the album nearly 30 years on. “It is thrilling to collaborate with Lyric head John Mangum, my musical partner James Lowe, and all of the artists at Lyric in reimagining this very special and historic a…",

They&#8217;d known each other since their high school years in Minneapolis. &#8220;The drums are physical and violent for me while the guitar is spiritual and emotional,&#8221; Johnson said in a 2018 interview with Australian Musician . He also quipped to the publication, &#8220;When you live here in the cold, you stay in [in] the winter time and you learn how to play.&#8221; As a member of The Time &#8212; and later, Prince&#8217;s The Family &#8212; Johnson helped establish the funk-rock, new wave and synth-pop hybrid that became known as the Minneapolis Sound.
