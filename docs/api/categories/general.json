But it's true. By reported concurrent player counts, Grow a Garden is bigger than PUBG ever was on Steam, by far. It's even bigger than Fortnite. So, as Hollywood rushes to convert pretty much every game from Call of Duty to The Sims into beaucoup boxoffice bucks, I have some sad but not-unexpected news to deliver to the parents of all those Roblox-obsessed kiddies. Sorry, folks: you're gonna be dragged to the theaters in about a year to sit through Grow a Garden, the movie. On the plus side, it'll get your kids to stop playing Grow a Garden the game for about 90 minutes. Silver lining?

Blizzard has yet to step in on a newly discovered method of spawning endless numbers of enemies in the latest phase of Legion Remix. Unlike the Gulp Frogs incident in Mists of Pandaria Remix, this farm seems relatively less broken, but it still can net you millions of infinite power, which is used to level up your weapon and increase your character's overall strength. It's been two days since players began capitalizing on it and Blizzard hasn't made any move to kill it. The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar. For now, players are grouping up to slay as many demons as they can before the valve gets shut off. The Sentinax farm, as it's being referred to, is pretty straightforward. In the Broken Shore area there's an event full of demons that drop items you can use to spawn more demons. The trick is to join a group so you can keep a constant supply of them flowing in.

What you've also probably noticed is that opening up the view to make things more immersive just ruins the visual experience. The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

No, I'm serious, after the last delay, it seems like everyone went through all the stages of grief and has reached acceptance , or near enough: \"Nothing wrong with delaying a game. Nothing at all. But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…?

Where previous games in the series had compensated for their lows with some truly high highs, I felt like Hangar 13's more linear world and more traditional mob story reduced its Sicilian series entry to a uniform level of predictability and blandness, and said as much in our Mafia: The Old Country review . But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

If a phrase like \"open-source engine reimplementation\" fills you with dread, fear not: using OpenMW is as simple as downloading it and double clicking the launcher (though you'll need base Morrowind installed), and I strongly encourage you to do so—the devs just released OpenMW version 0.50 , and it's a doozy. \"This round number release overhauls the gamepad experience, makes foundational steps in dehardcoding combat, further expands our Lua scripting API and, among the host of user interface fix-ups, introduces the highly requested quick item transfer,\" writes OpenMW team member Capo. \"Dehardcoding combat\" is the process by which OpenMW is gradually opening up to Morrowind's core combat functionality to tweaks, expanding the Lua scripting API further enhances OpenMW's capacity for all-power…",

Perhaps no studio has had this lesson drilled into it (kind of; its game didn't end up being 'bad forever') like CD Projekt Red. Cyberpunk 2077 is, now, an excellent game—worthy of inclusion on our list of the top 100 games you can play right now, no less. At launch? Less so . Now, the studio has extended a little social media backing to Rockstar over yesterday's delay to Grand Theft Auto 6 . One of the many venues in which Rockstar announced GTA 6's delay to November next year was X (the everything app!). As you can imagine, the announcement attracted tens of thousands of replies ranging from disappointment to anger to jokes to expressions of support.
