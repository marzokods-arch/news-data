    "body": "TL;DR Facer watch faces now support hourly chime sounds on Wear OS 6. The feature has to be enabled by watch face creators. Facer’s also got a new Fallout-themed Pip-Boy 3.0 watch face, complete with Face Chime sounds. At CES last week, smartwatch face platform Facer announced, among other things, a new feature it calls Face Chime , which lets watch face makers add custom chime sounds that play at the top of the hour to their faces. That feature is now available on Facer watch faces on Wear OS 6. Face Chime sounds are applied to watch faces by their creators, so only faces with sounds added support the feature — this update won’t let you add hourly chime sounds to watch faces on your own. Facer says there’ll be thousands of watch faces on its platform updated with Face Chime sounds over the next few weeks, though as of writing, it only highlights a couple dozen compatible faces.",

As the legend turns 80 on Monday (Jan. 19), Billboard reveals all the U.S.&nbsp;album charts that Parton has topped, and it is likely more than you think. Parton’s span of No. 1 albums extends more than 45 years, starting in 1977 and—so far— ending in 2024. The superstar has recorded and written music in several different genres, proving that her gorgeous, evanescent voice and unparalleled writing pen know no boundaries when it comes to musical styles. It took a full decade after her first album, the introductory 1967’s Hello, I’m Dolly, peaked at No. 11 on the Country Albums chart for Parton to reach the pinnacle. But then she was unstoppable: 11 of her albums have reached No. 1, sprawling across seven charts. Rockstar , which Parton said she made in response to being inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, hit the top of most charts at four, but she routinely hit multiple charts. For all her chart success, one major milestone has eluded Parton’s grasp so far: incredibly, she has never taken an album to the top of the Billboard 200. The closest she has c…",

The name comes from a Google Product Manager’s personal nicknames, and the internet loved it. The branding stuck, went viral, and now lives on as Nano Banana Pro. If you’ve heard of or used AI image generators, you’ve definitely come across Google’s Nano Banana . Even if you’re not into using AI to create images, you’ve probably seen Nano Banana’s work all over social media. The image model is freakishly good at editing and generating images, and we’re sure that, like us, you’ve always wondered what made Google name it Nano Banana. Now, we finally have the full answer, and the story behind the delightfully silly name.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year.

However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production.

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority Smart rings promise always-on health tracking in something you barely notice, but that idea took a hit last year. A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube viewers have noticed that connections from Albania don’t appear to be served advertisements. As a result, connecting to YouTube through a VPN with an Albanian endpoint can be an alternative to paying for Premium to get ad-free content. This method has its own expenses involved, could be risky, and isn’t guaranteed to last. YouTube Premium — even paying full price for it — is easily one of the best values in streaming around. The sheer volume of content available is impossible for anyone else to touch, ranging from the briefest Shorts to satisfy our decimated attention spans, to award-winning, feature-length films. But despite there being very good reason to pony up for that ad-free YouTube Premium experience , some viewers are dead-set on not paying YouTube one extra penny.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is reportedly upgrading the kernel version on the Galaxy S25 with One UI 8.5 beta. When the said build reaches more users, they could experience a more responsive and fluid interface on their phones. The upgrade could also improve battery backup on existing phones. Many of the changes and improvements that One UI 8.5 is slated to bring have been limited to visual aspects of the interface. While Samsung is also expanding support for external hardware and giving you greater control over some crucial settings , it may also be working to improve the overall performance. According to leaker Ice Universe, Samsung has also updated the kernel in the recent One UI 8.5 beta builds. With the specified “CZAA” build, which is likely leaked or unreleased, the Galaxy S25 Ultra jumps from Linux kernel version 6.6.77 to 6.6.98. According to the leaker, that’s a jump of more than 21 Linux kernel versions and could lead to a noticeable difference in the interface’s fluidity when the build is released broadly.",

You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene.
