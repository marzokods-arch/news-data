The creator described it as \"the most insane glitch in Borderlands\" on X, adding that it will \"change the build meta for every build.\" JoltzDude139 followed up on his initial post with a video detailing how the \"very stupid\" and \"broken\" glitch works. First, you need to input sufficient skill points into the tree to reach your ability of choice, with only one skill point remaining, while ensuring that all abilities you put points into remain two points below being maxed out.

Riot even saw promise in the studio, acquiring it in 2020 . Seven years later, scope creep and an apparently ill-advised engine rewrite caused Riot to call curtains on the whole thing . Hypixel's co-founder at the time wrote: \"Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be.\" What looked like the executioner's axe for ol' Hytale, though, might well have been its salvation. Riot sold the game's rights back to Simon Collins-Laflamme , the studio's original co-founder, passing the torch from Noxy back to Laflamme to go \"back to the original vision for Hytale.\" You might think that \"original vision\" would take some considerable time to cobble together, but it turns out, er, no. There's enough meat on this bone for a 16-minute gameplay video to just… be released. As the description states, \"No bells or whistles. Just the game as it is.

In fact, I've been there enough to know that actually, it doesn't have to be as daunting as it might at first seem. And I've helped others who have been there enough to know what the most common pitfalls are and what to focus on to get cracking and make a good gaming PC purchasing decision. Once you approach it systematically by narrowing down your choices bit by bit, it becomes a rather straightforward process.

There are plenty of wonderful gaming PCs at pretty reasonable prices these days. Especially given it's holiday season and there are already some cracking Black Friday gaming PC deals popping up.

I've been using gaming mice since they had little rubber balls in the bottom, and enjoyed a misspent youth cleaning the gunk out of the rollers to try and gain an advantage in my next Counter Strike match. Those days are long gone, of course, but now I get my hands on some of the best gaming mice available, and as a result I've put together this guide to help you decide on the best gaming mouse for you. We're going to discuss five things I wish I could have told Young Andy™ to look out for in his early gaming mouse purchasing days, in the hope they'll be of use to you today.

I mean, all that functionality scrunched up into a gamepad footprint does make the Echo Aviation Controller look like an arcane instrument. However, all those improbably placed knobs and dials allow players to simultaneously control the “pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, trim and core aircraft systems.” Talk about a packed flight.

I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice.

For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins.

Usually, Blizzard makes it pretty clear how a character will play in the game, even if their reveal cinematic is mostly focused on their backstory and isn't captured in-game. Vendetta's video is a tricky case because we see her cut apart a robot—pretty damaging by any measure—but also block its shots with her gigantic sword almost like a tank would. That's not unprecedented: Overwatch already has tank heroes, like Junker Queen, who could easily be mistaken for damage-dealers because they don't carry around a big shield like Reinhardt. It doesn't help that Blizzard hasn't clarified what role Vendetta will be in the video's description or on social media, leaving it to fans to try to suss out the answer.

Historically, scrap has been pretty easy to get, and its abundance throughout the map made crafting upgraded workbenches easy. Playing it safe and farming scrap around your base meant fewer people out in the world for PvP, but the strategy worked. As a solo player, I could visit monuments to find a little treat, but I didn't need to venture into the wild as soon as possible.

On the other, there are now six Magic cards of Dwight Schrute from the Office—a truth with a terrible psychic weight. Magic: The Gathering's next Secret Lair collaboration, however, makes so much intuitive sense that it might as well have been fated since Wizards of the Coast inked its first crossover contract. Magic's premier stable of megafauna artists have taken a crack at Monster Hunter, and the results are as excellent as you'd expect. (Image credit: Wizards of the Coast) Announced earlier today, the Secret Lair: Monster Hunter superdrop will land on December 1, bringing four sets of Magic cards reimagined with Monster Hunter theming in non-foil and foil bundles at costs of up to an inadvisable $560. And considering that MtG's artists have produced some of the coolest dinosaurs and dragons to ever grace bits of cardboard, it should come as no surprise that they've done some excellent adaptive work with Capcom's beloved creature designs. They've clearly done their homework: Anyone who's brought a bo…",

Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines.

Well, they said it was a lot of stuff to do with the endings and your choices across the series not mattering that much. I know better, though. In their heart of hearts, in the deep, festering reaches of their collective subconscious, the gamers yearned for the lifts. The first Mass Effect was beloved. It was also a game about standing in a lot of lifts. These things are not unconnected. Now, a doughty modder has restored the third Mass Effect (in its Legendary Edition form) to the pristine condition of its predecessor.

The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause.

While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this.
