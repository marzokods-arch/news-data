But with GDC now just a month away, there's bad news for the conference and everyone hoping to hear what he had to say, because he's not going to be there. Word of the last-minute withdrawal came from the Kojima Productions X account: (Image credit: Kojima Productions (Twitter)) \"We regret to inform you that Hideo Kojima will no longer be able to attend this year's GDC Festival of Gaming,\" the message says. \"We understand that this will be disappointing for fans and attendees who were looking forward to hearing him speak, and we want to offer our deepest apologies.

People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly. This is an over-simplification but games have so many moving parts that the final stages of development are where the whole project starts coming together.

The last ten years of Overwatch have certainly been a tumultuous ride, but I've stayed on nevertheless, because throughout it all, I always had confidence in Team 4 that they could learn from mistakes and put their best foot forward. And they have done, not only during the latest Overwatch spotlight , which blew everyone away, myself included, but multiple points over the last few years. The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game. Somehow Stadium manages to feel like an entirely different beast while also being approachable enough for Overwatch players to just pick up whenever, with even more changes coming soon to help its accessibility. Perks may have seemed like a small enough change, but they actually have a huge impact on how fights unfold in Overwatch.

If you go straight to Josee the Blind Hero like I did, you might be a bit underleveled for the fight.

Here's what you need to know to slay Josee the Blind Hero in Code Vein 2. Josee the Blind Hero phase one (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Before getting started, make sure you bring De-Snares to this fight. Josee's attacks can inflict Bind and trap you in place. Getting stuck is a death sentence. Josee uses a massive katana that can cover most of the cramped boss arena in a single slash. Her range is the biggest problem for this fight, but her sword has a lot of end lag. Stay close and be aggressive to score some easy strikes in between her combos.

    "body": "Nioh 3 has a lot of different levers you can use to increase your power, from raising your stats to spending locks on skills, getting new gear, and earning titles. One of the easiest methods is using slottable skills you'll find from chests or get by completing various activities. However, you can only activate so many before you run out of skill capacity . There are three types of skills—general, samurai, and ninja—and each one is increased separately. Luckily, it's not all too tricky to increase your skill capacity, though the boosts are somewhat small and incremental. How to increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja Team Ninja You can increase your skill capacity in Nioh 3 by finding texts or memorandums through trading with Sudama, reaching exploration milestones in each region, and as rewards for activities , such as valuable chests. Texts increase their respective skill capacity by one, while you'll need four memorandums of the same type before they'll add an extra point. Here are a few universal, samurai, and ninja texts you can find early on: Text locations Type Location Warrior's Text In a small chest in the friendly camp just north of Hamamatsu Gate in…",

    "body": "Working out how to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 isn't as challenging as many of the other bosses you'll encounter when you enter the open-world Warring States map, but it is still somewhat of a trial by fire in terms of learning the game's central combat mechanics. In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below. I'll also offer some other tips for triumphing against this spear-wielding Takeda clan warrior. After you beat Masakage, you'll complete the prologue section, and be able to enter the rest of the game for real. How to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 Though not all that tricky, Yamagata Masakage definitely requires you to adjust to Nioh 3's combat style, in particular, the Burst Break mechanic. Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away. Burst Break will also change you from Ninja to Samurai or vice versa, though you can tweak this. This attack is easy to recognise since he'…",

The new character in Highguard Episode 2, as the update is formally named, is Ekon, and he's a bit different from the rest of the pack. While the game's other characters summon phantom mounts to ride around on, Ekon is his own mount: He has the ability to shapeshift into a direwolf. Developer Wildlight describes it thusly: While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path. Ekon can use all of his other powers while in Wolf Form. His passive, tactical, and ultimate abilities are also wolfli…",

After today's Naval Update, I'm thinking that may change as Rust adds buildable seafaring boats, among other things. I say may because I know someone is going to immediately send my dinky ship to the bottom of the sea. Or they'll commandeer it and make me walk the plank. The player-made boats are ugly, hulking blocks of wood and metal sheets that do not look like they should be able to float, but they do. And that's what I love about them. You'll need the usual boat stuff to make one work (steering wheel, anchor, sails, engines, etc), so I'm not sure how long it'll take to hit the open sea's progression point, but I just want reassurance it's a reasonable option for solo players. Even if that means I'll have to face my fears and fistfight a shark. Floating bases offer a lot of the same features you see in land architecture, too. There are locks for steering wheels, stopping wannabe pirates from taking control of personal ships, and you can utilize any deploy…",

There's a lot to keep track of this season, and not everything is releasing all at once. To make things easier to follow, here's a breakdown of everything that's arrived in this season in Black Ops 7. (Image credit: Activision) Seven new weapons are coming to Black Ops 7 during Season 2.

The REV-46 has the fastest fire rate of any BO7 SMG, and it looks like it'll absolutely shred anything you put in front of it. (Image credit: Activision) The ERGT-17 is another fast-firing weapon—only beaten by the Peacekeeper in fire rate— and its superheated rounds ricochet off walls for stylish kills.
