    "body": "Miley Cyrus is looking back on some of the controversies that marked her early career. In a teaser for an upcoming interview on CBS Sunday Morning , airing Oct. 5, the 32-year-old pop star responded to a question from host Tracy Smith about the backlash she faced from angry moms during her transition from Hannah Montana to a more provocative music career. &#8220;I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess,&#8221; Cyrus says in the clip, shared on CBS Sunday Morning ’s Instagram . &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know until I was older, actually, how brutal it really was.&#8221; Cyrus first rose to fame as the star of Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana , which debuted in March 2006 to a record-breaking 5.4 million viewers — the highest in the network’s history at that time. She was just 13 years old when she played Miley Stewart, a teenager leading a secret double life as a Malibu student by day and a global pop star by night. The show ran until 2011. After her success on the show, Cyrus made a bold transformation with a more edgy and provocative image, releasing albums like 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed and 2013’s Bangerz , the latter debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

    "body": "As she says on Virgin closer &#8220;David,&#8221; which she performed to a sold-out Madison Square Garden on Wednesday (Oct. 1) night, Lorde doesn&#8217;t belong to anyone &#8212; but if her fourth studio album did have a home, it would be New York City. Not only did the Kiwi pop star &#8212; fresh off of a devastating heartbreak and in the trenches of gender discovery and body-image issues &#8212; craft much of Virgin with producer Jim-E Stack after relocating to NYC four years ago, she also channeled the city&#8217;s energy into every facet of the album. Lead single &#8220;What Was That&#8221; features a reference to Brooklyn venue Baby&#8217;s All Right, while &#8220;If She Could See Me Now&#8221; calls back to ancient horses &#8220;running up Prince Street&#8221; downtown. And when it came time to promote Virgin , Lorde made her TikTok debut with a video of herself walking through Washington Square Park in the West Village, which would later become the site of a frenetic music video shoot costarring a swarm of fans. With all of that in mind, the singer&#8217;s Ultrasound World Tour stop at MSG felt like nothing short of a homecoming show (even if Lorde is actually from New Zea…",

During a segment of &#8220;Plead the Fifth&#8221; on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday (Oct. 1), the iconic singer was asked whether their drama began when the superstar rapper allegedly asked her to play his mother in his 2002 autobiographical film 8 Mile . “From what I heard there is truth to that,” Carey told host Andy Cohen. “But I don’t think that he actually… well, who knows who approached who.” Cohen pushed further, asking, “But did that ignite the beef?” Carey responded vaguely, “Um, no. “I mean, maybe. It depends what he’s thinking. I really don’t care. Like, whatever he’s said, then I’m that, fine. Not really. But that’s a rap lyric.” Earlier this summer, music producer Damion “Damizza” Young — who began working with Carey in the late 1980s — claimed on the TFU podcast that he introduced Eminem to the pop superstar. Young claimed Eminem wanted Carey to portray his alcoholic mother in 8 Mile , despite being just four years younger than her. Carey declined the role, which eventually went to Kim Basinger. “Her insecurities kicked in big time,” Young said, also implying that the two late…",
