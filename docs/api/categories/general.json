Darrah's first video covered Anthem's earliest years and the issues with its initial conception that he said echoed through the duration of its development. This second chapter is a meaty one, because it begins in 2017: the year that Darrah took over as the project's executive producer, and a time when he said Anthem \"had developed this highly dysfunctional relationship with decision-making.\" (Image credit: EA) In the years following Mass Effect creator and original Anthem creative director Casey Hudson's departure from BioWare, Darrah said that Anthem wallowed without a clear direction. Sustained by BioWare mythology and EA's hopes for the project's live action potential, Anthem existed in a purgatory where decisions about its production were either never made or endlessly relitigated. \"Massive numbers of decisions that affected other decisions behind them were piling up on th…",

It's also a brilliant excuse to re-open the reliably polarising difficulty in games debate. I can't remember there ever being this much buzz for an exploration platformer before, but aside from the aforementioned difficulty, there's probably a few good reasons why you might bounce off Silksong. Perhaps you suffer entomophobia? Maybe you abhor protracted boss run backs ? Or maybe you're just averse to hype and want to dive into Silksong once the buzz has quietened down and the post-launch updates have smoothed its roughest edges? If you don't like Silksong but do love labyrinthine 2D platformers, we've put together a list of some great alternatives. Silksong belongs to a very crowded genre, one that has spawned countless games over the last decade.

Yup, there's yet another iPhone out, the iPhone 17 Pro , and if the numbering scheme isn't flirting with satire, the extent to which Apple's latest iPhone resembles a gaming PC surely is. Don't believe me? If I told you there was a new device selling for four figures with a high-Hz, adaptive refresh screen, backed by a sales pitch that name-checks \"AAA gaming\" and \"hardware-accelerated ray tracing\" and which introduces tensor cores to its newly upgraded GPU, what would you say it was? Oh, hang on, it also sports vapor-chamber cooling for its CPU and GPU, the performance upgrades are kind of incremental this time around, but the price has still gone up. See what I mean? That's the pitch for a new gaming PC or laptop. It's probably that new vapor-chamber cooling that's most eye catching. It's not a first for a smartphone, but when Apple sticks a technology into one of its devices, you know it's gone totally mainstream. To quote Apple, \"deionized water is sealed inside the vapor chamber, which is laser-welded into the aluminum chassis to move heat away from …",

    "body": "Roughly two months ago we got our first look at the system requirements for Borderlands 4 , a process that involved many of us on the hardware team scrunching up our noses. Listed on the Steam page was the insistence that the game would require eight CPU cores as a minimum, which seemed highly unlikely given how many speedy six core processors there are on the market. So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close. Taking a look at those CPU minimums once more, we've got the Intel Core i7 9700 and the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X …",

Apparently you can get fully-fledged RTX 3080 Ti PCs for just $32 from them. No, really, that's what one lucky (he says, through gritted teeth) Redditor got from a \"small auction place up in Columbus Ohio that only offers local pickup.\" It was advertised as just a chassis and they bought it \"specifically to build an AI development rig in later as I would need a large case for it\" and were naturally \"shocked to find out exactly what was in it … I've never gotten lucky like this before.\" The auction screenshot says the final bid was $23.50 but the Redditor says $32. Maybe there were additional fees for using the auction service. Whatever the case, it's a whole lot cheaper than getting a new gaming rig these days; I certainly wouldn't be quibbling over an extra $9.50. I bought a \"Case\" for $32 at auction from r/pcmasterrace Oh, and this isn't your average RTX 3080 Ti gaming PC, either. It's a powerhouse of a workstation with a Threadripper CPU and 256 GB of RAM.

But as player excitement swells, the closer we get to GTA 6's release, so does some developers' anxiety. In an interview with MinnMax (via VGC ), Ghost of Yōtei creative director Nate Fox was asked if the dev team celebrated at all when they heard about GTA 6's delay , to which he replied: \"We're all still hungover. Multi-month hangover. That was a great day.\" It's no secret that GTA 6 isn't worried about competing for players' attention—a former GTA dev even joked that GTA 6 has \"no competition\" and so can release whenever the developers see fit. But the same can't be said for all the other studios releasing games in and around the next year. A Bloomberg report from a year ago uncovered how developers were hanging back on announcing release dates in anticipation of GTA 6 because they wanted to avoid the original Fall 2025 window like the plague: \"They're determined to keep their own games far, far away.\" Some brave developers didn't shy away from releasing games in Fall 2025, on…",

To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on .

To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up.
