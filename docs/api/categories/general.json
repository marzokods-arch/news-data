Simply named No Fog , this mod, created by Fellow_Demo, strips all the fog from Ebisugaoka, but players can also use it to just \"tone down\" the fog as well. Seeing the before and after pictures next to one another, it's clear how much was lost to the fog, aesthetically speaking. (Image credit: Konami / Fellow_Demo) The images with no fog look brilliant. The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine.

The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50). Weapon crates are pure RNG, and have their share of critics: some would say that the upfront cost and unknown outcome make them gambling. The new Genesis Uplink Terminal seems like a respon…",

There's been a healthy heaping of difficulty discourse surrounding Silksong, and with good reason. This game's tough as nails. I just wrapped up my 60-hour playthrough of all three acts, and I did not walk out of Pharloom with the same thumbs I started my journey with. I did almost all the mementos (I didn't bother with the Hunting Journal; I'm here to hit stuff, not collect things), got all the fleas , and alt+F4'd out of petty spite while trying to beat Seth's score in Flea Dodge. Managed it later, though. Shudder. Never again. Nice. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Silksong isn't just hard, though. It's actively mean-spirited at times. I've managed to write not one , not two , but three bench-based PSAs about hidden resting spots in terrible areas. At times, the game actively goes \"ner-ner\" and gives you a wedgie for daring to play; It hits you over the head with an Acme frying pan; It paints a tunnel on the side of the cliff, watches you splat into it, and then nicks your wallet while you're twitching on the ground.

Secure Boot is a security feature within the UEFI and used for signing Kernel-level code that runs on your PC to ensure it's not, er, dodgy. The idea is, if everyone agrees to sign their code using cryptographic keys, an OS and its apps can be more confident that malicious software is not running in the background, such as a rootkit or low-level cheat software. Game developers are increasingly turning to Secure Boot to ensure their anti-cheat software isn't bypassed. Battlefield 6 has become somewhat infamous for requiring Secure Boot, through EA's Javelin anti-cheat software, though Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat and Riot's Vanguard also require it. Secure Boot will be required to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, too. The flipside is, there are a good deal of people that don't trust various game developers to have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat applications.

Before Amazon corrected its mistake, the release date could be seen on the listings for both the standard and Treasure Box editions, along with the first reveal of the PS5 box art. Sony's next State of Play airs during the Tokyo Game Show today, which seems like a more appropriate place to announce the release date, so it seems like Amazon Japan just jumped the gun. I'm pretty excited for this one. Nioh 2 is up there with the best of FromSoftware's fare, but like the greatest soulslikes, it's not content to simply ape a competitor's games.

Both have three fans, and both GPUs have the same imagery spinning on those fans. Where the older model has a blue and white tint to said imagery, the newer one combines a grey and pink. However, spin that GPU around and you will spot a big change. On the back of this RTX 5070 card sits an anime cat girl with blue hair, a top hat, and a waistcoat. This gives her a magician's look. The previous card also has a cat girl, but a hole in the rear plate of the GPU gets in the way of the image, which means the new card will get you a smidge more cat girl, should you care a lot about cat girl economics.

Baby Steps is played from a third-person perspective and it lets you change whether the camera is oriented to the left or right of Nate. But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up.

The only paths back up involved even tricker rocks, and predictably I fell again, tumbling off the grassy ledge to land next to a mudslide. Fortunately there was a dry path beside the mud, and unfortunately I found a single rock on that path, tripped, hit the mudslide, and slid to the bottom of it. Walking back up that path I managed to slip into the mud twice more, the second time achieving such slippery velocity I flung myself back to a previous biome, landing in a lake.

The first Model M (or then, the IBM Enhanced Keyboard) was the keyboard IBM threw in with its 3161 model terminal and, outside of the typewriter and industrial models, is the genesis for the keyboard in the mainstream with the features that have become ubiquitous elsewhere, most notably key placement for things like the Control and 'inverted T' arrow keys .

I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them.

As explained in a knowledge base post , Intel has split its GPU drivers into two distinct packages: those for Alchemist and Battlemage-powered GPUs and a set for everything else from the past five years.

Unless it's super-critical, of course, in which case, updates will appear as needed.

    "body": "It's been almost six years and one name change, but 2XKO (formerly Project L) finally opened its doors as part of a closed beta earlier this month. If you've been one of the unlucky folk begging all your mates for an invite code to no avail, don't fret: the tag fighter is throwing open the gate to all players much sooner than I expected. Riot just revealed that 2XKO will officially enter early access on October 7. No more closed beta, no more invite codes. The bad news is that it's still a PC-only deal—despite our PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S pals being included back in the 2024 beta, they're still being left out of the main event for now. There's no word on when the game'll go multi-platform just yet, unfortunately. (Image credit: Riot Games) But for those of us on PC, early access marks the start of 'Season 0' as well as the debut of 2XKO's 10th champion, which Riot is still keeping firmly under wraps. Well, it's trying anyway. A datamine of the game's upcoming battle pass included a graphic of Braum, Yasuo, and Darius sporting new costumes alongside a picture of rat mascot Teemo. The latter of whom isn't exactly in the game yet. The official 2XKO X account responded to the…",

    "body": "Disney Dreamlight Valley has announced that its next free update, Return to Beast's Castle, will be dropping on October 1. As the title suggests, it will whisk us back to the Beauty and the Beast realm, and plans to add a few fan favourite characters for us to invite to the valley. As it stands, you can only unlock Belle and the Beast in Disney Dreamlight Valley, alongside Gaston, if you have the Rift in Time expansion, but now Cogsworth and Lumiere will be joining us in this update. The footstool is also already available as a companion, and frankly, I'd love to see another piece of sentient furniture joining us in the next Star Path to coincide with this update. What we know about the update outside of assuming the characters is incredibly scarce, though. No details of what sort of quests to expect have been shared, so much like the last few free updates, Mysteries of Skull Rock and Wonderland Whimsy , I imagine we will have to expect the unexpected. There's been a particular emphasis on puzzle-solving in the recent Inside Out and Peter Pan update, so hopefully, there will be some sort of bookshelf puzzle or something similar to unlock these companions. If you don't already have…",
