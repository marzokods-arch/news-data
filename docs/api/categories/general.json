That was the case even after Team Ninja apologized for their previous game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, running like crap on PC . If you cast your mind back five years ago, Nioh 2 also had a less-than-ideal launch. Ninja Gaiden 4 ran decently by all reports, but the settings options left a lot to be desired . I'm not here to give a full performance run down of Nioh 3, but I've just spent a couple of hours running around in its newly released demo and I can confirm that I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works on my aging game laptop. It's far from a disaster!

I held out for as long as I could, but eventually games on CD started demanding I install Steam to run them, so I caved and soon after got Portal and a handful of digital-only indie games like Audiosurf, Uplink, and Blendo's zombie tower-defense game. It was basically all over for my free time from then on. Which is why it's wild, more than a decade later, to be reminded of Atom Zombie Smasher's existence by it being patched. This 15th anniversary update isn't going to transform the top-down rescue sim where the zombies are tiny pink squares into The Last of Us 3, but it does add a horde of little changes. For starters, where before you could slow time down to 10%, now you can drop it all the way down to 1%. That's so slow you're basically making Atom Zombie Smasher turn-based, a change I approve of in any tactics game. Also changed: you can deselect units with the Escape key; the seams around cutscene vignette art are gone; and when you're on the Behind the Scenes screen the scroll limit works so you don't scroll too far and end up looking at the game as it would be seen from a passing aeroplane.

In the history of the series this character has been critical to world events, yet we've never seen their face, not even in a picture. The show had every chance to continue the tradition by, say, just showing them in silhouette or by obscuring their face, but nope!

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

First noticed by Shinobi602 on Bluesky , Bloober's countdown website at remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com (which as far as I know remains undeciphered) now features a stylized image of a rose, and the message \"Some things never leave the walls.

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

It followed that up with a demand that all employees return to full time in-office work , and then initiated a 'Rupture Conventionnelle Collective' process in order to reduce the workforce at its Paris HQ by 200 people. Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",

So much so that the majority of enthusiasts only upgrade their systems piecemeal, one component every so often, or get a new rig after many long years.

Back in July 2025, you could pick up a 32 GB kit of DDR5-6000, with a CAS latency of 30 cycles, for under $90 (albeit during the sales). For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings.

Currently, just three keyboards are supported: Razer Huntsman V3 Pro , Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Mini, and Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8 kHz. In fact, although it could possibly be some peculiarity of my setup, it's in such a beta state that I couldn't get it working with the Huntsman V3 Pro. I installed the firmware for the keyboard through the separate firmware updater, and it was working with traditional Synapse, but no luck with Synapse Web; it just says \"no compatible devices found.\" It's not a problem with my browser, either, because Corsair's web hub works for me, and that seems to use the same WebHID protocol. YMMV here, though. Once the wrinkles get ironed out and hopefully more devices are added, it should be a massive boon for any Razer users who don't want to deal with what, at times, can feel like local bloatware. Which is surely everyone by now, right? That's not so much because of memory usage—for me, the Synapse app uses less than 270 MB in the background and 600 MB when opened, which isn't a m…",

Whether it's the pomo ultraviolence of Harvester , the sickly roach simulator Bad Mojo , or Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages (which I'll let you Google yourself) the era's point 'n' click adventures have a lot of strange artefacts ripe for rediscovery. If you're interested in oddities from the period you probably know Inscape as the publisher of the aforementioned Drowned God, but also Bad Day on the Midway, which was directed by members of surrealist rock troupe The Residents, and almost received a TV adaptation by—take a breath—David Lynch. Inscape was a dab hand at sicko-friendly adventures in other words, which can probably be attributed to its proximity with the film and music worlds (it was funded by HBO and Warner Music Group). Which brings us to The Dark Eye. This 1995 point 'n' click adventure is based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, and features voice acting by writer and artist William S. Burroughs.

It's mostly dialogue for Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale, and Lae'zel, since Karlach and Wyll had different voice actors in early access, though a smaller amount of their dialogue has been restored by splicing existing lines of audio.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 kicks off with a Steph flashback set 200 years ago when she was a Canadian citizen sent to an internment camp by the invading Americans (one of whom mockingly called her a hoser, no less) and then watched her mom die in front of her. Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding. Chet has been unsettled for a while, but when he finds the missing Woody's eyeglasses in the garbage disposal, …",

But, as is usually the case with Terraria updates, what was originally meant to be a fairly straightforward Dead Cells crossover pack turned into something much bigger, requiring just over three years to develop. The resulting update has patch notes of near biblical proportions, but not everything included in Bigger and Boulder is listed: \"As always, we never share everything that is in each update,\" reads the update notes , \"not even in the 'full' changelog. Part of the fun is in the discovery!\" Very few aspects of Terraria are left untouched with 1.4.5, which is available right now. There's new items galore, and a hugely overhauled crafting system with which to make them. Inventory management has been overhauled, as has world seed functionality. On that note, a new \"skyblock\" world seed now exists which, as the name implies, resembles a floating island. According to ReLogic it \"introduces entirely new gameplay dynamics and ru…",

There's nothing wrong with Genshin Impact, but I only need so many open world action RPGs where you meet anime characters you can collect like Pokémon, and most of the copycats don't have anything else going on. Arknights: Endfield , however, does have something else going on: surprisingly robust factory building . I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.
