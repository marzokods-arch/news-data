Google’s been working on a tool to lock down access to apps, and we find a few signs of it here. Android 17 is set to deliver a lot of changes to our favorite mobile operating system, not just in terms of new functionality, but also with updates to the look and feel of existing systems.

Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore.

The N64 decomp and recomp scene has exploded in the past year, and over the weekend, the latest release was shadowdropped out of nowhere. Despite being a fan project with no involvement from Nintendo or Microsoft (which owns Rare), the Banjo-Kazooie recompilation is fully playable on PC, Linux, and Mac, and fixes and modernizes many aspects of the classic 3D platformer. Banjo: Recompiled is essentially a full remaster of the original game, improving frame rates and adding widescreen support for modern displays. It also enables the use of a second analog stick to control the camera, providing a much more modern control scheme than the C buttons on the N64 controller.",

Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

Last month, we asked you all what you want to see from Google’s foldable efforts this year. Quite a few of you said you’d be fine with more of the same — but many more are holding out for serious change.",

That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time.

Now it looks like Google could be getting ready to add music creation to the Gemini app. Music you make with Gemini would be stored with the rest of your content in My Stuff. Watching an epic action movie with the sound off just isn’t the same — the right music can really elevate an experience to the next level. Not all of us are musically inclined, though, which is why we were so excited when Google introduced a new feature for its Recorder app with the Pixel 10 that used AI to help us create music . Late last year, we saw access extend to Pixel 9 handsets , and now we’re checking out what could be an even bigger expansion for tools like this.

Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time.
