Starsand Island reminds me a whole lot of the Rune Factory games—janky 3D animations galore, anime art out the wazoo but with a charming Eastern vibe that makes me overlook the weirdness that seems to inevitably come from adding a third dimension to farming sims these days. (Image credit: XSeed Games) I was given a map, a rickety small farm, and a whole lotta freedom from minute one which was mighty refreshing. No going around introducing myself to every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the island. There's just a bit of hand-holding with some introductory quests, and the encouragement to go and become certified in a number of professions. These professions cover the standard go-to farming sim stuff: farming, exploration, crafting, fishing, and ranching. Each one is headed up by a mentor—and oh, god dammit, I'm going around the island introducing myself to everybody without even realising. Th…",

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

A good chunk of the post is dedicated to his interactions with the community over the last three decades. \"My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas,\" he said. \"I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.\" Harada said that those experiences \"became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator,\" something which continued even as both Tekken and the FGC at large grew bigger. \"Many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for…",

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

We're not just getting a new character, of course, though Season 20 is, I hate to say it, another oddly small update. Stadium fans like myself certainly have the better deal, too. Below, I'll go over when you can play Overwatch 2 Season 20, and everything you can expect to sink your teeth into. Overwatch 2 Season 20 release date and time OW2 Season 20 begins on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT , which coincides with the usual update time for the game in your region.

One of those is Northgard , a Viking-themed RTS that was released in 2018. Built on traditional strategy foundations, Northgard added novel ideas like game-altering weather systems and a region-based expansion system. The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure. Chiefly, the Definitive Edition combines the base game with the Cross of Vidar expansion, which introduces a new campaign where you must guide your Viking Clan through new lands in a post Ragnarök world.

So popular, in fact, that it's even a surprise to developer ArenaNet. The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).

But players hoping to get their pirate on in Rust will have to keep their powder dry a while longer, because the naval update has been delayed. In a blog post on Facepunch's website titled \"Shipwrecked\", COO Alistair McFarlane explained the situation: \"For almost 12 years we have managed to deliver weekly updates or, in more recent years, guaranteed monthly updates with meaningful changes.

Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives.
