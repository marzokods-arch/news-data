After spending a lot of time with this particular mouse, I can confirm this is certainly the market for these mice. But despite me thoroughly enjoying using the Pulsar X2 CrazyLight, it probably won't be the best option out there for many competitive FPS gamers. If you aren't familiar with the company's line-up of gaming mice, looking at Pulsar's product pages can be very confusing. Even just looking at the X2 series , there are a whole bunch of different models there. There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing. Apart from being a little too small for my hand, I also found the hump in the latter too pronounced for my liking and a little distracting, so I've stuck to considering the regular one for this review.

Lucy finally got to the Vault-Tec facility where her dad's cooking up something terrible, more Coop flashbacks, and we finally got a Super Mutant cameo. What's better, he's voiced by none other than Ron Perlman. It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living. The mutant then asks the Ghoul to join his cause of going after the Enclave. After Coop refuses, he gets knocked out and dragged away from the hideout. (Image credit: Prime Video) That's all the time I needed. I had thought we'd see a Super Mutant at some point in the show, especially after FEV was properly mentioned in the last episode, but I didn't expect they'd get Perlman to voice it. For those unfamiliar with Perlman's previous Fallout work, he voiced the iconic line \"war never changes\" in almost every Fallout game and voiced Butch Harries in Fallout 4—despite his first role in the series paying just $40 and a sandwich .

I am delighted to report, however, that D&D Beyond is doing something unequivocally neat in its partnered content program, and looks set to continue doing neat things with it without screwing up. In case you're unfamiliar, D&D Beyond is a digital tabletop version of the TTRPG that Wizards of the Coast bought in 2022. The content partner program, which has been in effect since 2024, allows folks to integrate their work into D&D Beyond while being compensated for their craft. While my little independent-loving heart thinks sweeping everything into one WoTC-owned platform probably isn't healthy for the hobby as a whole, this kind of cooperation is still a major improvement over… well, the entire OGL thing .

No, literally. \"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years,\" Ingold writes on Bluesky . \"I admit I'm surprised! Made in nine months, mostly as an experiment to learn Godot, and an excuse to play with some actors. (And for me to do some acting.)\" TR-49 is a puzzle game where you have to feed books to an old computer to discover a world-changing secret. Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so. It reminds me of the recent success of Peak, the co-op climber Aggro Crab rustled up in a frantic four-week game jam , refining it in a few short months afterwards alongside Landfall.

When they all first launched, eight to 12 months ago, it was a depressing task because stocks were incredibly low for almost every model, forcing prices to go sky-high across the board. Eventually, towards the tail end of 2025, the situation resolved, and you could pick up all kinds of GPUs for considerably less than their MSRPs. Now, thanks to the global memory supply crisis, graphics cards sporting 16 GB or more of VRAM are all shooting back up in price. In November of last year, you could bag yourself a 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 Ti , or RTX 5080 for $400, $745, or $990, respectively. Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268. That might not seem particularly bad, especially in light of just how expensive they were at launch, but those prices are the very best around. For example, B&H's cheapest 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti is $630 , and should you want an RTX 5070 Ti from Best Buy , you'll need to hand over $1,199. This isn't to say that graphics cards with less than 16 GB of VRAM haven't been unaffected, as they have all increased in price, too. It's…",

But let's not get ahead of ourselves: Update 2 is currently available in pre-release testing (enable this via the launcher's settings menu), and if all goes well, it should be in everyone's hands come Friday or Saturday, suggests Collins-Laflamme. The standout feature of Update is no doubt its improved mining experience. Pickaxes have been reworked to make higher-quality picks mine faster (frankly, I was baffled that wasn't how they worked initially). Building on that, while WorldGen V2 still isn't here, Hypixel has changed how ores are spawned. Namely, major ores are better distributed between the tiered zones, and there's much more ore overall, especially in the Devastated Lands. I still think Lucky Mining is one of the best Hytale mods , but these changes go a long way in making mining and gear progression feel more rewarding. Another major…",

    "body": "The Xbox Full Screen Experience (or FSE) debuted late last year on the pricey Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, steadily trickling out to other Windows-based handheld gaming PCs and more traditional gaming desktops over the following months. While our Dave rated the stripped back, controller-oriented OS in his Asus ROG Xbox Ally X review , that rollout hasn't been plain sailing. However, the latest Windows 11 build hopes to smooth out the experience for PC gamers. In the release notes for Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.7653 , the known issue on PC is described as, \"some apps [behaving] unexpectedly when using FSE, particularly those that expect to be locked to a given size or launch additional windows.\" The issue isn't completely fixed yet, with the Insider Team continuing to \"validate scenarios and as such keeping the known issue active for now.\" It's worth noting that FSE is more sophisticated than a straightforward full-screen mode, aiming to improve gaming performance by minimising many of Windows 11's background tasks. However, depending on your platform of choice, you may not necessarily see huge gains—and an early YouTuber experiment suggests that Linux-based gamer OS Bazzite p…",

    "body": "Your Arknights: Endfield team comp is really important, even more so than many other gacha games, in fact. Taking a leaf from Zenless Zone Zero's book, Endfield is all about party elements (called 'arts' here) and combo skills, establishing little synergies with your team that'll let you effectively 1-2 enemies, perform arts reactions, or buff the art your team is using. The best Arknights: Endfield characters are strong either because they're great at a very specific role, such as how Xaihi is the meta Cryo support character, or they're super versatile, like how Ardelia and Akekuri will work in basically any team comp. Still, there are team combos for each art which are very strong when put together. Some of these are more free-to-play friendly than others, with Electric and Physical/Cryo making for great free teams, while mono-Physical squads are currently among the most costly if you want them to perform at peak. Whatever you choose and whoever you pull, hopefully this will give you an idea of some of the best comps for each art.

But it's a tectonic shift in how the game is designed and played. Players have been used to comprehensive and game-warpingly powerful combat addons for over 20 years at this point, so of course it's kicking up a fuss. Game director Ion Hazzikostas, who talked to PCG contributor Heather Newman recently , has spent a lot of his time dutifully reassuring players, reiterating intentions, and trying to disarm panic. Now the conversation's shifted in another direction: Has Blizzard gone soft on addons, by walking back some of the changes and specifics? No, says Hazzikostas, that was always the plan. As a matter of fact, when Midnight went into alpha testing, the strategy was to first go scorched-earth and see how much broke. \"I was surprised, and I learned a lot about exactly how many of our add-ons are written in the first few weeks of alpha … We realized pretty quickly that a ton of these add-ons were written …",

He set himself the task of achieving the lowest possible base resolution in Red Dead Redemption 2 and then applying various upscaling technologies to compare the results. Turns out they vary from absolutely awful to still-kinda-potatovision-but-better-than-you'd-probably-guess, if that's not an unforgivably excessive use hyphenation and compound adjectives. Anywho, to go lower than 720p, for starters you actually have to edit Red Dead Redemption 2's config file. 2kliksphilip first tried 120p base resolution, then 90p. At this point, text and menu controls get very hard to read even given those elements are rendered at the upscaled resolution, which is double the vertical pixel count but still very low.

For instance, the Nintendo Wii once allowed Japanese gamers to place an order at a local restaurant right there on the console. Taking its name from food delivery platform Demae-Can, the Demae Channel was deactivated back in 2017 and the feature was never available outside of Japan—until now. YouTuber Retro Game Attic recently documented the process of ordering from his local Domino's via the Food Channel, a homebrew resurrection of the Demae Channel that brings the Wii's food delivery functionality Stateside for the first time. Peering at a fuzzy CRT (the Wii was a standard definition console), lengthy loads on the 2006 console draw out the process of ordering—but a 14-inch hand tossed pizza with extra cheese does ultimately arrive (via Hackaday ). As Nintendo has long since shut down many of the official servers that once supported the Wii, the Food Channel is instead offered by Wii Link , which is an unofficial homebrew community project working to restore much of the console's online functi…",

Most of your factory shenanigans in the game are well explained as you progress, whether it's placing ore extractors to passively mine, conveyor belts to automate production, or gun turrets to defend outposts. However, this first step, building Relay Towers and connecting them up, can be a little confusing initially, and you might be left scratching your head. Here I'll explain the whole process, placing the Relay Towers and connecting them so you can complete the Valley Reboot quest and get your Automation Core up and cooking.

    "body": "Creating an Arknights: Endfield tier list isn't quite as difficult as you'd think. Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars. I'll rate each character below based on how valuable they are in their best team comp, or based on the fact that they're very strong and versatile, slotting into most teams, such as Gilberta, Ardelia, and Akekuri.

While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",

A mini patch, 12.0.1, will arrive in the next month and will continue to improve core WoW features, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas told us in an exclusive, wide-ranging interview. And other tweaks will happen as players figure out how to evade the limitations Blizzard has placed on their favorite combat add-ons, particularly those that simplify raid combat.

You could save and apply entire ensembles at once, but whenever you replaced one of your equipment pieces—or if you just wanted to change outfits—you'd need to reapply your desired transmog and pay the associated fee for each piece of gear.

    "body": "Thunderbolt 5 is a powerful interface. It's also an expensive one. Available only on the latest devices, and with limited availability today, it took me a while for one to land on my lap. When one did, with the Alienware 15 Area-51 , I began my search for a hub that might let me take advantage of its high-speed capabilities. As I discovered, a Thunderbolt 5 hub runs anywhere from expensive to 'good lord, they can't be serious, can they?' The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma I'm looking at today is more the latter at $400 / £400 . But do cheaper Thunderbolt 5 hubs come with RGB lighting? They do not—at least most I've seen. The Thunderbolt 5 Dock offers a range of ports to those willing to drop that sort of moolah on the thing: 3x Thunderbolt 5 (downstream), 1x Thunderbolt 5 (upstream; for the connection to your PC, with 140 W power delivery), 1 Gb ethernet, 2x USB Type-A 3.2 Gen2, 1x USB Type-C 3.2 Gen2, an SD card slot, and a microphone/headphone combo port. Thunderbolt 5 supports PCIe 4.0, DisplayPort 2.1 and USB4 standards for a properly universal dock over a few of those connections.

Release date Jan 21, 2026 Expect to pay TBA Developer Inkle Publisher Inkle Reviewed on Asus ROG Ally Steam Deck TBA Link Official site It’s set entirely in a damp crypt. All you do is jam four-digit codes into a machine. It’s got a title only slightly more marketable than 'Mindseye 2: The Randy Pitchford Cut’. And it’s so good that you’re honestly lucky I’m not currently throwing a Steam Deck at you and forcing you to play it. If those stakes sound severe, they’ve got nothing on what poor Abbi is going through. She’s the unfortunate protagonist of TR-49, stuck in the underbelly of a cathedral with nothing but a mysterious machine for company. At least she’s got it easier than William, the man upstairs keeping watch while also offering occasional advice. Though he’s far more frequently offering pleas to hurry up and use the machine before they get caught by the murderers hunting them down. (Image credit: Inkle) Sorry to sideline your boring problems, William, but what a machine! I visited Bletchley Park on a school trip once and got bored, ungrateful millenial cretin that I am. Fortunately, Inkle got inspired in…",
