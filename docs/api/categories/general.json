So it's good news for a bunch of handheld gamers that Asus has just released a big batch update for the three handhelds, plus the oft-forgotten ROG Xbox Ally (non-X). And when I say a 'big' batch update, I mean a BIG one, at least if Asus' announcement post on X is anything to go by: \"Everyone! This is a BIG week for updates on the ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, ROG Xbox Ally, and ROG Xbox Ally X! A new Armoury Crate SE update is on the way, bringing expanded CPU and power controls, stability upgrades, and a series of fixes and improvements across both devices.\" I'm not sure what \"both\" refers to, given the company lists four devices, not two, but what I can say is the most exciting updates are for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The latter gets 'P-core' and 'E-core' options in the Armoury Crate SE software. Note that 'core' is all lowercase there, because 'P-Cores' and 'E-Cores' refer to Intel cores. AMD has its own v…",

    "body": "OLED PC monitor sales are on the up, according to data outfit Trendforce . Compared to last year, sales are up by fully 65%. That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures. OLED TVs still make monitors seem pricey. (Ima…",

I'd prefer just to use one mouse for everything, but I've yet to find one that suits all my needs and preferences, all of the time. Most of that comes down to feel and fit. The Viper is great for gaming, but I often prefer to have something more substantial in hand for work, which is where the Pro Click comes in. There isn't a mouse around that's capable of being both whenever I want it to, but the Orbital Pathfinder is certainly on the path to being that mouse, thanks to its wealth of customization options. Which is why we've just added such a category to our best gaming mouse guide , and until something better comes along, the Pathfinder is our top recommendation for the best customizable gaming mouse.

On that front, Valve explains that the company's upcoming machine is actually \"equal or better\" than 70% of Steam gamers' systems. Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. So that's also another way to, kind of, think about where we kind of arrived at that performance level [that they targeted]\" (via Notebookcheck ). The engineer explained that the company wants the Steam Machine to allow users to play all their Steam games, but \"we also kind of wanted to target more of an entry-level device\" that is affordable. Thus the middling specs. The Steam Hardware Survey tells us ab…",

The Fortnite developer announced the new feature in a post on the store, stating that \"players can now purchase and send games directly to friends on their Epic friends list.\" Users who purchase gifts through Epic's payment system will earn Epic Rewards—which gives customers between 5% and 20% back on Epic purchases. The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.

Lonely City Hardware on Weibo (via harukaze5719 on X) says, \"AMD’s GPU lineup already saw a price increase around October, but the increase was not large, so it has not yet significantly impacted the cost of graphics cards on the market.\" That's unfortunately set to change thanks to a \"second wave\" of price increases from AMD. \"AMD’s internal communication indicates that the price of graphics memory has risen significantly. The next wave will involve price increases for both GPUs and graphics memory. The magnitude of the increase may be greater, possibly leading to higher end-market graphics card pricing.\" The scale and precise timing of the increases is said to be as yet unknown.

Given how many times we've ended up flat on our backs behind an unkicked football, I cringe to say this, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a new Half-Life game will be announced within the next year or so.

The problem is they keep getting cancelled before anyone gets to see them. \"People often ask me why I don't make a sequel to Nier, or why I'm not working, but that's because I've had so many projects that have been discontinued lately,\" Yoko said via machine translation. \"Even though I was working, it wasn't released to the public. I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

Japanese actor and model Konatsu Kato lends her voice and likeness to protagonist Shimizu Hinako in Silent Hill f.

Her streams have since gone viral, with the VODs of her streams receiving millions of views on YouTube .

More than just being about her reactions and opinions, Kato is not a regular gamer, so Silent Hill f has proved a bit of a baptism of fire for her.

There are a few significant tweaks here, but the things that stand out to me are: yet more fixes for the game's A-Life system and a whole new difficulty. That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives. It's always kind of an illusion, but it's an illusion that many felt was especially lacking in Stalker 2 at launch.
