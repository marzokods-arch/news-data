    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new Counterpoint Research report predicts that smartphone prices will rise in 2026, with average selling prices increasing by as much as 6.9% as memory costs surge. The same report points to shrinking shipments and higher manufacturing costs, pushing smartphone makers to potentially cut specs like RAM and limit budget options. For consumers, this means phones launching next year will be pricier while offering fewer meaningful upgrades. If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size.

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate.

The visual overhaul is currently rolling out to English users on both the mobile and desktop versions of Gemini. Google’s Gemini app just got a big update for anything related to location, and it’s making it easier to find places that matter to you. Now, instead of a plain text list with a small map at the bottom, your local search results start with visuals and context inside Gemini . If you’ve ever asked Gemini, “Where’s a good coffee spot nearby?” and had to scroll through lots of text before opening Google Maps , this update aims to fix that. Now, the first thing you see is a map, followed by cards for each place with photos, star ratings, and highlights from reviews, the Gemini team confirmed on X . Android Authority first spotted this feature earlier this month, along with a ChatGPT-inspired redesign to Gemini’s tool menu .",

This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Gboard’s emoji grid has quietly shifted from nine columns to eight, making the emojis look bigger. Users who spotted the change couldn’t figure out what exactly happened. It turns out that Google added a flag in October that allows it to adjust the emoji column counts in Gboard, and it’s now set to eight. If your Gboard emojis have felt oddly large lately, you’re not alone. There’s a good reason why those emojis are suddenly looking bigger.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR Google has removed the ability to uninstall updates for system apps via the Play Store. Users now have to visit app settings in the settings menu to uninstall system app updates. This is a more convoluted way of uninstalling updates to system apps. Google has long allowed Android users to uninstall updates for system apps via the Play Store . Unfortunately, the company has now removed this Play Store feature for no clear reason.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is reportedly working on a new smartphone camera sensor with global shutter-like capabilities. This should result in better image quality when taking photos of fast-moving subjects. It’s believed that this 12MP sensor could land on a next-generation flagship Galaxy smartphone. Virtually all smartphone cameras on the market use a rolling shutter to capture photos, but Samsung may have developed a new camera sensor that has “global shutter-level” capabilities. Sisa Journal (h/t: Jukan on X) reports that Samsung has developed a smartphone camera sensor with global shutter-like capabilities. It’s believed that this tech could come to its next-generation Galaxy flagships. It’s unclear if the outlet is referring to the Galaxy S26 series , the Galaxy S27 family , or upcoming foldables.",

    "body": "Credit: SelfixCase TL;DR This smartphone case features a second display for selfie previews, allowing users to take selfies using the primary camera of their phone. It’s only designed for the iPhone 17 Pro, but the concept is cool enough to be adapted for Android phones as well. It also features a built-in slot for a 2TB microSD card, allowing users to expand their phone’s storage. If you read Android Authority regularly, you know we’re obsessed with our phone cases . We love talking about innovative cases, even if they’re not necessarily Android phone cases, like this one. A company called Dockcase has made a phone case that comes with an unusual advantage — a secondary display for selfie previews. Called the Selfix case (h/t GSMArena ), it’s designed specifically for the iPhone 17 Pro, though we don’t see why something like this can’t be built for an Android phone.",
