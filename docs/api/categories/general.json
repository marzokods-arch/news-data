Capcom and Square Enix teamed up during Tokyo Game Show this weekend to show off a little more of the crossover. Monster Hunter: Wild's half is out right now—with hunters able to take on Omega Planetes—while Final Fantasy 14 joins the party on October 7 with The Windward Wilds trial that lets Warriors of Light face off against Arkveld. Even skimming through Final Fantasy 14's portion of the showcase this weekend, the encounter with Arkveld felt considerably more MMO-y than Monster Hunter. Which sounds daft, but not so much when you compare it to the game's previous collaboration with World which introduced a fight against Rathalos. While it was still quite MMO-like—it was literally in Final Fantasy 14, after all—it felt like there was a real concerted effort to integrate as much Monster Hunter madness as it could. That meant a lot of untelegraphed moves, huge knockbacks, and the abil…",

Creative director Graeme Timmins has already agreed as much, noting the infamous knives \" will get addressed \", alongside some unintentional interactions and broken builds, very soon. For those living under a rock, the Penetrator Augment that can drop on throwing knives causes all damage dealt to the target to become guaranteed critical hits for a short duration. With almost any build, especially those specced into bonuses with critical hits or status effects like the bleed Vex build , this short window is more than long enough to burst down any boss in the blink of an eye. Plus, you can also get the Damage Amp Payload effect, which—in the same vein as Penetrator—causes the target to simply take increased damage for a duration. In fact, you can even get these two bonuses together if you're lucky for guaranteed critical hits and a flat increase in damage…",

Warning: spoilers ahead for the latest episode of Peacemaker! The emote comes from the second season's opening dance sequence, where John Cena's character stiffly flails his arms before following up with a cheeky little hip thrust. With no context it could be excused as a silly goofy routine, but Peacemaker's latest episode came with a huge revelation that all but confirms the meaning behind the move. It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2. Essentially, he's accidentally found himself in Nazi utopia, exclusively populated by white people and where the American flag's stars have been exchanged for a swastika.

The trailer starts with a bunch of celebrities: Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett gearing up for a fight, but sadly, they don't really get too far as they're blown to bits in just a couple of seconds. This is followed by an unknown soldier asking, \"Who was that?\" as another soldier replies, \"Doesn't matter, let's move.\" I was pretty relieved when I saw these celebrities get blown up. It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground. So blowing up Zac Efron and co may seem like a bit much, but it has worked wonders in quelling …",

Not me, though. Not because I love Windows 11, but because I'm still miffed about something that happened 10 years ago: the death of Windows 7. Now that was an operating system with hair on its chest. And for dedicated enough users, it turned out it never truly died at all. As YouTuber ChrisPro recently found out, you can even run Silksong on Win7 with some elbow grease and a can-do attitude. Okay, to be fair, it's not an easy process. Steam stopped officially supporting Win7 as recently as January 2024, which means even getting the client running is a headache. ChrisPro had to root around in their Steam install and kill off a couple of dll files to trick the client into booting. Once it did, the entire experience had an ominous red message reading \"Steam will stop running on Windows 7 in 0 days\" looming over it. Then,…",

They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme. My favorite so far is Forgive Me, a quest based on a viral joke about the storytelling in Soulsborne games—a joke tweeted by Borderlands 4 head writer Sam Winkler back in 2022. (Image credit: Sam Winkler) Because the internet is the way it is, Winkler ended up having to explain in the replies that he actually likes FromSoftware games, saying, \"I am begging anyone who thinks I'm dunking on fromsoft to learn how to make fun of the things you love\".

Both Hollow Knights are deliciously old school in how they make you work for your double jump, withholding it until deep into the game.

From the trailer above, it looks like a solid iteration on the Pets DLC for the original House Flipper game. It's not just pets being added to the game, but an entire new region, Puffin Isle, for you to help develop. There are 10 new pet-focused houses coming to House Flipper 2, alongside 10 jobs to tackle and several new buyers to interact with. There are over 40 cat and dog breeds being added to the game, and more than 30 smaller pet species you can adopt, like rabbits, snakes, and hamsters. I wonder if a Maine Coon and a frog would get along? As anyone who's ever owned a pet will know, you can't just adopt an animal and call it a day. Those things come with so many accessories, and there are hundreds of pet-related items that you'll be able to decorate with. You'll be able to take pets with you while you're fixing up a house, too. I'm sure they'll be very helpful and do a good job. If you like to play co-op, then your friends can pet them while you all work together. The House Flipper 2 Pets DLC is coming 2026. Yo…",

In a new gameplay trailer revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, we see the kind of preparation that goes into hunting the monstrosities that call the world of Aurai home. In the snow-covered mountains, we see the two-player splitscreen in action. The pair set up a small campfire and erect some tents to sleep in and store goods overnight. You can't just trek endlessly: you need to rest, eat, and stay warm. There's also a clip of a traveller stopping for a rest in a cave, so you can use natural shelters to protect you from the elements, too. In the combat montage, even smaller enemies pose a challenge. Outward 2 isn't a game where they'll wait in an orderly circle and attack one by one; they just take advantage of their numbers if they have them.

A poetic and trippy trailer at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct has revealed that the full game is launching later this year alongside an Egyptian gods-themed DLC.

I sure did after watching events in the trailer escalate from typical survival activities like farming and base-building to visions far more perplexing, like a tie-dyed bus with multiple laser-sighted heavy machine guns on the roof and a towering squid monster invading our planet from dimensions unknown. There was also a man riding a pig. You don't see that every day. I couldn't just walk away from a trailer like that, so I talked to Joe Dietsch, co-founder and CEO of developer Wolf Haus Games, to get a few more details about Join Us. According to Dietsch, in Join Us you're sent by an \"omnipresent cult leader\" into a rural area of the country, and \"it's your job to essentially start a new franchise there.

Of course, you don't play as the cult's true head honcho in Join Us; you're a franchise owner of sorts, building a personalized wing of a much larger doomsday cult in the rural United States. You'll build a remote compound, conceal yourself from local scrutiny, and recruit the psychologically vulnerable who you can detect with target-highlighting \"leader vision.\" It's like Batman's detective sight from the Arkham games, but for emotional manipulation.

You can then replay that movement, allowing the protagonist to, in the first example, cross a large gap by first recording themselves walk the length of the gap on a flat surface. But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world.

It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears.
