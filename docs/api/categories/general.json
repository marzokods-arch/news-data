    "body": "Music collecting and appreciation is a deeply personal hobby. It’s something very important to me and serves as a snapshot of time and place. Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

    "body": "Credit: Prakhar Khanna / Android Authority With Gemini slowly but finally rolling out to Google’s smart speakers and displays, I’ve found myself filled with renewed optimism for my stack of devices. The search giant has stripped the platform of countless features over the past couple of years, and even some basic voice commands have failed to function like they once did. I’m not alone — hundreds of users have voiced the same complaint about Google Home across social media. Luckily, Gemini looks like it’s on track to revive Google Home’s usefulness but I’m equally concerned that it will introduce problems of its own. Given that I already have Google’s AI Pro subscription , I’m also looking forward to using Gemini Live — the two-way voice conversation feature that won’t require a wakeword every single time. However, after extensively using it on my phone, my excitement levels for the feature’s expansion have been significantly dampened.",

This would come years after Nothing, HTC, and Xiaomi offered devices with transparent or translucent rear covers. It’s also believed that the iPhone 18 Pro line could get punch-hole cutouts and a variable aperture main camera. The iPhone 17 series is roughly two months old, but we’ve already heard several iPhone 18 series rumors. Now, a trusted leaker has suggested that the iPhone 18 Pro line could get a design feature seen on devices like the Nothing Phone series. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These features will only work in the device’s default language, likely disappointing for multilingual users. One UI 8.5 may also bring scam detection that would analyze phone calls using AI for any fraudulent activity, though this feature may be limited to Korea initially. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update is expected to bring significant reforms to the Quick Settings and notifications on eligible Samsung devices. In addition to the visual changes, the update is also likely to bring iOS-like notifications summaries and prioritization features . While useful, these features may not please every user.

Earlier this year we uncovered signs that Google was working to restore this functionality. The PiP YouTube player has now started appearing for some Messages beta testers. When we spot Google working on a new feature for one of its apps, it’s often anyone’s guess just how long we’ll have to wait before it’s ready to go live — assuming it even does at all. That can be a matter of days, weeks, months, or longer. Today we’ve got some good news about a long-ago-spotted upgrade that finally looks like it’s nearly ready for prime time, as it starts hitting beta testers.

The new Card 5 is even thinner than previous models and supports wireless charging. Google’s Find Hub got off to a rough start, but as time’s gone on, the network has become more useful and we’ve seen a wider variety of tracker hardware. Today, one of the earliest manufacturers of Find Hub trackers, Pebblebee, is selling a couple of new trackers that come with some interesting perks. Pebblebee has started sales of new versions of its Clip and Card trackers. They’re both compatible with Google’s Find Hub as well as Apple Find My, and unlike many previous Pebblebee trackers, neither requires a proprietary charger. They’re also marked with QR codes that let anyone who finds them contact you to return your lost item.",
