As the curtain fell, a small group of diehards expressed hope that it might somehow be brought back without a reliance on EA's servers—hope that was given, well, hope when former executive producer Mark Darrah said Anthem did actually have local server code \"right up until a few months before launch,\" and more importantly, \" the code is there to be salvaged and recovered .\" That's a far cry from actually making it happen, but some people do seem to at least be making progress in that direction. Youtuber And799 (via Kotaku ) has posted a video showing Anthem alive and kicking, and—big points here—with two players (actually two accounts) logged in simultaneously.

In case you're unaware, WoW's been of a mind to fix its UI mod (addon) problem for a long time. Specifically, combat addons—the idea being, a player shouldn't have a raw competitive advantage because they had a bunch of third-party plugins installed.

I've hopped in and had some time to fiddle around with the changes on my Outlaw Rogue—both the lack of combat addons, the class changes made to facilitate that, and Blizzard's updated \"Cooldown Manager\" and Personal Resource display.

As I discovered, a Thunderbolt 5 hub runs anywhere from expensive to 'good lord, they can't be serious, can they?' The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma I'm looking at today is more the latter at $400 / £400 . But do cheaper Thunderbolt 5 hubs come with RGB lighting? They do not—at least most I've seen.

This is $20 off its retail price, the lowest price I've seen on it so far, and not that far from even 1080p prices. Join us on WhatsApp for daily deals , direct to your phone. Despite its reasonable price, the specs aren't too low either. 144 Hz refresh rate is solid, and the 1 ms response rate is about average for a gaming monitor. 27 inches is somewhat on the smaller side, but it's not so small that it can't se…",

    "body": "For anyone hoping against hope that the memory supply crisis just might start to stabilise in 2026, I've got bad news: An executive at Kioxia, a memory manufacturer based in Japan, recently admitted that the company's production volume for the year is already sold out. The managing director of Kioxia's memory business unit, Shunsuke Nakato, made the admission during an interview with Korean news outlet Digital Daily , elaborating that the ever-hungry AI industry's demand for memory has led to a challenging supply and demand situation. Nakato went on to say that, as many companies are continuing to invest in AI out of a fear of being left behind, the situation is likely to continue into 2027 at least. Though memory supplies are limited, Kioxia is apparently deploying something of a 'gentleman's agreement' with its clients, remaining committed to existing contracts rather than adopting a 'first-come, first-served' or 'everything to the highest bidder' approach. However, Nakato also admits that even long-term Kioxia customers are having to contend with as much as a 30% year-on-year price increase. Also interesting to note from this interview is Nakato's scepticism about QLC tech. For…",

I'd forgive you for believing that your end goal right now is finding mithril ore, but that's not the case. Mithril's not actually available yet, despite it being required for several recipes listed in-game. The good news is that, when it's eventually added, it won't just be another block to break—presumably in the unreleased fifth zone. Hypixel's founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, says , \"We got some fun ideas about Mithril… let’s say it won't be as simple to mine as the others\". As for what these ideas are, exactly, that of course remains to be seen, and it's added to an already long list of to-dos the team already has to tackle— Collins-Laflamme only bought back the project two months ago and whipped up the early access build in record time, after all.

According to Weebit Nano , this agreement will see its ReRAM tech \"integrated into [Texas Instruments] advanced process nodes for embedded processing semiconductors.\" Despite what the name suggests, ReRAM isn't actually Random Access Memory, but a Non-Volatile Memory (think NAND, but not—I'll elaborate shortly). So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

Not content with immediately baffling an entire community of Hytale players, Sahib then went to X, where he shared a minute-long demo of his work-in-progress crossplay mod. In the video, Sahib has Minecraft and Hytale clients running in windows beside each other, with the same geometry represented in each game's respective blocks and art sty…",

    "body": "Europe's PEGI game rating body blew the surprise earlier this month, but now it's official. Life is Strange: Reunion is reuniting Max Caulfield and Chloe Price for one last adventure. Max, now a photography instructor at Caledon University, is forced to use her time-reversing 'Rewind' power to escape an inferno that devastates the school, killing many of her friends and colleagues. Thrown three days in the past, Max must figure out what caused the fire, stop it, and save her friends—a job complicated by the unexpected arrival of Chloe, a \"shocking repercussion\" of events in the previous game, Life is Strange: Double Exposure , which I will not get into here because spoilers . It all sounds very much like a Life is Strange game, but for the first time in the series both Max and Chloe will be playable in the same game, with the perspective alternating as the game progresses. Choices have consequences \"that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative,\" publisher Square Enix said, \"all culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga.\" Life is Strange: Reunion is being developed by Deck Nine, which is interesting: The studio made two rounds…",

Below, I'll go over exactly where you need to look to find azure kelp in your world so you can get to crafting your own time-saving teleporter. You'll likely have a long trek ahead of you, but grabbing some kelp isn't all that tricky once you know where to look. How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it. Breaking it with any tool or even your hands drops azure petals, which aren't what you want in this case. In …",

    "body": "Here's one that didn't show up on the CES 2026 show floor. Asus has some new dual-mode 4K monitors with uprated, higher-refresh 1080p modes . We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode. So, it's actually the 3x model that hits the higher refresh rate. It's just also starting at a much higher base 4K refresh. …",

    "body": "Think twice (or ideally, three times) before clicking on LinkedIn links, as researchers have spotted bad actors using them to hide malicious code in seemingly innocuous files. As reported by The Hacker News , ReliaQuest recently spotted a phishing scam that prompts a user to download a self-extracting archive . It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

Now, of course, it's very different: sometimes most people don't like the game . They're still complaining about Bethesda's Creation Engine though, which remains based on that rickety, hilarious Oblivion engine from 2006 (itself based on the engine of games before it). Someone else who's perhaps a tad fed up with the Creation Engine? Dean Carter, lead on Fallout: London, the sweeping Fallout 4 overhaul that transplants you from Boston to the Big Smoke. In a chat with Esports.net , Carter said that—while the Creation Engine actually has a lot of upsides—he's worried Bethesda is gonna stick with it for Fallout 5. \"I’m really worried that they’re gonna keep going with the Creation Engine,\" said Carter. \"I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine… but I do think it started to show its age.\" In particular, it…",
