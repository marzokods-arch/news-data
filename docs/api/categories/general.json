Suddenly the MMO became turn-based as I clicked NPCs and waited a good 30 seconds for them to offer me a quest. The lag got even worse when I made it to the opening zone of the expansion and watched other players blink in and out of existence as the servers desperately tried to keep up with where they should be standing. The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby. It doesn't help that a lot of Mid…",

A seemingly harmless question, but Wales doesn't seem interested in taking it on. \"I don't care,\" he says in response. \"It's the dumbest question in the world.\" Jung, perhaps sensing an opportunity to take the interview somewhere unexpected—or maybe just curious about why Wales seems so touchy about the whole thing—presses on, suggesting there's some sort of \"dispute\" and asking, \"What are the facts?\" Wales laughs, but he's clearly not in a mirthful mood. When Jung tries one more time to nail it down, saying, \"For you, you're the founder?\" Wales goes off. \"Can I just say again, it doesn't matter. I've answered your question four times,\" he declares forcefully, no longer smiling. Then, after a momentary pause, he gets up quickly, saying, \"You know what? I'm done.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. My first night with Black Ops 7 went as well as expected. After scoping out the first few missions of the bizarre co-op campaign with friends, we hopped into 6v6 multiplayer, making a point to stick to the \"open\" playlists with \"minimal\" skill-based matchmaking. As I feared after the open beta, Black Ops 7 is shaping up to be another weak year for Call of Duty multiplayer, shining a light on the series' streak of diminishing returns. Much like Modern Warfare 3 (2023) to Modern Warfare 2 (2022), Blops 7 is very much an expensive expansion for Blops 6: Guns now have sci-fi greebling and Titanfall angles, but behave the same as last year. Its big movement \"innovation,\" the wall bounce, is barely there. Maps are plentiful and pretty, but remain in a structural rut so predictable in 2025 that you don't really need to play them to know their layout (it's almost always a box with three lanes).

Leviathan is 111 meters long and the 50th largest yacht in the world. Onkenhout says the diesel-electric vessel is the \"most comfortable yacht ever designed\" by the company (you'd hope so!) and a feat of custom engineering. You want cables? This baby's got 280 miles of them, powering everything from an on-board hospital (with live-in nurse), air conditioning, satellites, cavernous garages for tenders (small boats, not chicken) and submarines, and of course entertainment systems. We're not done, not even close. Leviathan has two gyms, a 250 square meter beach club with a spa and bar, diving platforms, and whatever a \"dedicated drinks pantry\" is. The…",

Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025. So, despite AMD having had a relatively bumper year for desktop CPUs, it still trails behind Intel with 33.6% of the market share.

This little device shoots out drones that chase down enemies and explode. And when I say chase, I mean it; these drones don't complain about having to travel halfway across the map to find a target. If that sounds incredibly annoying to play against, then you're spot on. They're easy enough to shoot, sure, but you're wasting ammo shooting them out of the sky (don't forget how long reloading takes), and they're the perfect distraction. While the drones are unlikely to score many kills (it requires two to hit a target to bag a kill), having one damage an enemy you're fighting is more than enough to seal the deal. It's basically an easy way to soften up the enemy or get them to fire their gun, wasting their ammo or even revealing them on the map if they're not using a suppressor.

    "body": "We know a lot about the Steam Machine . We know its specifications. We know what it looks like inside. We even know what it's like to game on it. But we don't know how much it'll cost or when it will be available, outside of sometime in the new year. So, I've asked around the PC Gamer team to find out what we think. With plenty of details on what's inside this machine, and Valve's tactics for the Steam Deck , we have most of the information we need to take an educated guess at the price. We don't know anything more than we've already said in our various stories on Valve's Linux box. We're simply piecing together our expectations, Valve's history, the specs, and some amount of vibes-based optimism from the team—a large amount of vibes-based optimism from the team. I've tallied up an average from our guesses—or those of us brave enough to actually take a guess—and it's around $525. That's notwithstanding the difference between the smaller 512 GB model and the much larger 2 TB model, however, which may well cost in excess of $100 more based on today's Steam Deck OLED pricing.

    "body": "It's a tricky moment to be a gaming keyboard . Do you jump on the Hall effect bandwagon to ensure you're bang on trend, and able to deliver that customisable actuation and rapid trigger response all the aspiring pros desire? Or do you stick with tried and tested mechanical keys, which still represent the vast majority of the gaming keeb market but don't offer the same customisation or response times as those analogue switch whippersnappers? Razer's latest V4 incarnation of the BlackWidow—ahem, sorry, BlackWidow Low-Profile Tenkeyless Hyperspeed —sticks in old-school mechanical territory, but pairs that ol' reliable tactical switch feel with low-profile keys that have a shorter travel from starting position to the bottom of the keypress. It can be used wired or wireless, has three control buttons and a clickable volume roller, and the stated 980-hour battery life is impressive enough. But the real crux of this product is the feel of the keypress. Which means it's a very subjective object to review. My review sample's fitted with Razer's proprietary orange low-profile mechanical switches, one of three options which also include 'crisp and clicky' green switches, and a 'smooth and si…",

No longer simply issuing specs and outsourcing the rest, Valve is set to fully realise what was at best a half-formed vision more than a decade ago, while also fortifying its existing hardware successes. Valve has introduced a number of new branches to its hardware ecosystem, including the aforementioned PC-for-the-TV device. But who is it for? And is Valve really angling for a slice of the console market? While we know the Steam Machine will release early next year, we don't yet know how much it will go for—but I'm feeling hopeful it could be an affordable, accessible option for the PC gaming-curious. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: PC gaming is an expensive hobby. After the not small upfront cost of building your very first rig, there's the regular rhythm of pricey hardware upgrades (to say nothing at all about the cost of repairs and replacement parts). So, could the Steam Machine corner the market of folks curious about the power and customisability of PC gaming, but who still want to hit the ground running when it comes to gaming? Given that the bog-standard PS5 now costs $550 and the price of a 1TB Xbox X has climbed…",

Whether that's using the environment to throw yourself into space , or various items in ways they're not really meant to be used in, I'm always impressed with just how quickly everyone else seems to find these loopholes. With that being said, Peak's newest patch update has decided to encourage players to continue doing this by buffing one of the game's most exploited items - the Scout Cannon. These updates mean the Scout Cannon can now launch zombies, which is perfect for anyone struggling to make their way through the Roots biome. The weight of the item has also been reduced from six to four, which is pretty huge news, as one of the sole reasons I don't carry it around is because of how heavy it is and how much stamina I lose when doing so. Outside of this, some smaller tweaks like making the cannon easier to jump out of and the forced ragdoll time being reduced have been made, too. With the reintroduction of the Scout Cannon glitch, I genuinely fear for the power speedrunners now have when it comes to reaching the Peak. However, outside of these significant Scout Cannon buffs, an issue the game has…",

This year, alongside the usual multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone Mastery Camos you'd expect, you'll also have to play the campaign mode and prestige each gun upwards of three times. Don't shoot the messenger; remember, you don't have to do this grind if you don't actually want to.

As a result, Requiem is already looking very different to its two immediate predecessors: instead of seedy backwaters and toothless hicks, the footage we've seen thus far takes place in the claustrophobic environs of faceless high rises and labyrinthine halls. In that sense, it's quite reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. During a chat with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, I noted the shared DNA in Resident Evil 4 and Village, and asked if Requiem might have a similar relationship with any older entry in the series. He confirmed my theory with no hesitation: \"I believe in that regard, it's very close to Resident Evil 2,\" he said. Aside from the setting, Requiem also has a stronger focus on the qualities of its player-character than the last two instalments. Sure, Ethan Winters had a backstory, a personality, and a very pressing motive, but Kumazawa makes an interesting distinction between Ethan and Requiem's new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, who is extremely vulnerable and unused to confrontation or violence. \"When you look at Res…",

Veilwater Basin is a tropical jungle filled with lakes, waterways, and sunken ruins to explore, and the region is also perfect for building a new base because you can put all that water to use. Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin.
