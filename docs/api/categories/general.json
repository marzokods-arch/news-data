The camera also adds a variable aperture for better portrait effects and closer zoom. DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

Naturally, we were also expecting the OnePlus 15R at the event last week. However, OnePlus made no mention of the phone, besides briefly stating it would be “coming soon.” Fortunately, the company has now begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, which is likely to raise our expectations for a launch soon. OnePlus’ sites for the UK and India have already begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, showcasing a silhouette of the upcoming phone.

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Anker via Amazon I may be a bit of a homebody, but I enjoy my nature adventures and like to stay powered during camping trips, picnics, and other outdoor activities. The issue is that power banks are often insufficient, and power stations tend to be bulky and heavy. Smaller units, such as the Anker SOLIX C200 and C300, find the sweet spot between portability and power. Currently, they are also available at very enticing discounted prices. Buy the Anker SOLIX C200 for just $104.99 ($65 off)",

The cause for the malfunction isn’t clear. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Something’s up with YouTube search on desktop. This morning, many users — including us here at Android Authority — have noticed that YouTube’s search filtering options aren’t functioning. This was brought to our attention by a post on the YouTube subreddit by user Kotif92 . YouTube’s search filters, accessible via the Filters link in the top right corner of desktop search results, all show up “grayed out” — the only filter that’s still accessible is the option to sort search results by relevance (which is the default search behavior).",

The platform bans AI-generated videos, uses verification tech from the Guardian Project, and runs on the decentralized Nostr protocol to keep content human and creator-controlled. While Elon Musk is working on his own AI-powered Vine revival, diVine is betting big on nostalgia and authenticity. Once upon a time, Vine was the biggest craze in the looping-video scene. It was a six-second playground that turned everyday moments into endlessly replayable cultural snapshots. While Vine may have vanished years ago, its comeback is arriving from an unexpected place. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, the very company that shut Vine down, is now backing diVine , a reboot that restores part of the original archive and brings six-second looping videos back to life.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Play System updates deliver crucial features to Android devices, but uninstalling problematic ones has been tricky. Google has offered a rollback tool, but that requires connecting to a computer over the Android Debug Bridge. Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble. And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.
