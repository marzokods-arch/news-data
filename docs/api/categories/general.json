    "body": "TL;DR The OneXFly Apex is a new premium Windows gaming handheld from One Netbook. It features an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, an 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, and an 85Wh external battery. More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

Thousands of people gathered dressed to the nines, the women rocking sequined gowns and kitten heels, the men wearing tailored suits and polished dress shoes. Their attire fused Puerto Rican culture and Mafia fantasy and seemed beamed in from decades ago — but the crowd entering Miami’s Kaseya Center on this warm evening wasn’t there for an act of yesteryear, but rather one of the hottest arena artists on the planet. “It was a whole vibe,” Rauw Alejandro says over Zoom months later, now off the road and back home in Puerto Rico. “It felt like we went back to the past and you can feel that energy. It’s not mandatory, but if you dress up, you’ll have more fun because you’re immersed in the story. You’re literally traveling to that time and age.” Like many arena and stadium stars today, the 32-year-old reggaetón star encouraged audiences to follow a special dress code for his show. His Cosa Nuestra tour this year channeled the elegance and glamour of a certain 1970s New York, along with the Cosa Nostra that ruled it.

OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T).

The phone may be initially limited to Asian markets — particularly South Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. Despite previous reports of a launch in the US, Samsung may choose not to launch it beyond the “Greater China” region. 2025 appears to be the year of new products from Samsung. After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV is a popular live TV streaming service that helps subscribers cut the cord, but it’s struggling to keep legacy channels on board. It wrangled with NBCUniversal earlier this month, and had similar public battles with Fox and Paramount over distribution rights in 2025. Now, YouTube TV is undergoing similar negotiations with Disney. Google this week announced it is negotiating with Disney to keep networks like ESPN and ABC available on YouTube TV. The company’s current distribution deal expires on October 30 at 11:59 PM ET, and both sides are warning of a blackout if a “fair deal” isn’t reached.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

In any case, a greater choice in officially supported hardware will be a great thing when it comes to using a privacy-focused OS. The bad news for Pixel-privacy fans is that after the Pixel 10 , there’s no guarantee that GrapheneOS will add support for any of its successors. GrapheneOS has supported every Pixel model so far, following through on promises to support several devices through until end-of-life.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole. However, it seems T-Mobile has caught on, and the free ride is now coming to an end for them. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Mass production of the remaining models will reportedly start in January. The company had originally planned to start mass production of all three models in December At the beginning of October, there were rumblings that Samsung may be reversing course on replacing the Galaxy S Plus with the Edge. Not long after, we started hearing reports that Samsung may have halted development on the Galaxy S26 Edge due to lower-than-expected sales. That decision appears to have had a ripple effect that’s now changing the production schedule of the company’s next flagship phones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Lite plan’s best rate requires an active Verizon voice line; otherwise, it costs $10 more per month. Speeds are capped at 25Mbps and aimed at rural users who previously relied on DSL or satellite connections. It seems every cellular carrier is pushing home internet hard these days. Even Mint Mobile recently announced plans for its own low-cost home internet service starting at just $30 a month when prepaid annually. Not one to be one-up in pricing in seems, Verizon has now announced a more competitive Lite plan that starts at just $25 a month. Unlike Mint, you don’t have to pay annually for this rate either.
