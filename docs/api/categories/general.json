    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is extending the timeline for Google Duo’s demise by a few months. The previously set deadline of September 2025 for removing all Duo features has now been moved to January 2026. When that happens, all users will be automatically migrated to Meet, and any older history will be removed. In 2022, Google merged its then-popular video calling app Duo into Meet , which, at the time, was limited to video calling for Workspace accounts. Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026. We recently witnessed the updated timeline in a warning message shown at the top of the Google Meet app on Android. The support page still displays the older …",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Protecting our expensive new smartphone is a top priority for many of us, and online marketplaces are flooded with options, from cases to display protection . An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

The launcher received a rare update on the Google Play Store today, its first since May 2024. The update includes new features and improved compatibility with newer Android versions, but its former developers say it’s over a year old. Nova Launcher, the popular alternative Android launcher that appeared to shut down last month , is getting an unexpected update. The launcher was sold to analytics firm Branch Metrics in 2022, but by 2024, the company underwent mass developer layoffs. Only Nova Launcher’s founder, Kevin Barry, remained working on the launcher until September 2025, when he too left Branch. Now, there’s a glimmer of hope Nova Launcher might not be completely dead yet. Nova Launcher users spotted an unexpected version 8.1.3 update roll out on the Google Play Store beta channel, according to a post on Reddit’s Nova Launcher sub from user colinaspinall . As of now, the latest update hasn’t appeared through the stable release channel, or Nova Launcher’s official beta website . While the update is a sign someone at Branch is paying attent…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The leak came from a private Google Teams call that someone joined and screenshotted before posting on a GrapheneOS forum. Pixel devices running standard Android still allow limited data access before first unlock, but GrapheneOS versions appear to block it more effectively. Google Pixel phones already have a solid reputation for security, but leaked Cellebrite documents show they’re even harder to crack when running GrapheneOS , the privacy-focused Android alternative. Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer. During the meeting, the uninvited participant took screenshots of what appears to be an internal ‘Android OS Access Support Matrix’ and then shared them on the GrapheneOS discussion forum .",

Those screens won’t integer scale DS games, and the SoC is too weak for the MelonDS emulator. The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority When Google announced the Pixel 10 series , a lot of focus was given to the new 100x Pro Res Zoom as the highlight camera feature, with Camera Coach taking the second seat. What went under the radar is Google’s continuous work on Panorama mode, which today is absolutely amazing and has finally reached its full potential. I’ve been using my Pixel 10 Pro XL as my main camera for a couple of months, including a short trip to Athens and some sightseeing around France while my parents were visiting. Here’s what makes panorama mode amazing on this phone and why I think people are sleeping on it.",

    "body": "I’m a big fan of OnePlus phones. From the day I got my invite to buy the OnePlus One to happily using the OnePlus 13 for much of 2025, OnePlus’s Android handsets have really resonated with me over the years. The company’s focus on smooth performance, long battery life, fast charging, unique hardware, and opinionated cameras are all things I value in an Android phone, and OnePlus has consistently delivered on them. And yet, with the OnePlus 15 , I find myself feeling rather conflicted. OnePlus did a lot right with the phone, and its commitment to performance, battery, and charging is more evident than ever. But at the same time, OnePlus sacrificed other parts of its identity to the point where I’m not even sure I recognize this as a OnePlus phone.",
