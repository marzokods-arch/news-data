The JYP Entertainment girl group is a hit among K-Pop and non-K-Pop fans alike, bringing playful and toe-tapping tunes accompanied by polished dancing and powerful live vocals. Even on the Billboard charts, TWICE is constantly winning with tracks like &ldquo;This Is For,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Feels&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moonlight Sunrise,&rdquo; all English tracks that don&rsquo;t even begin to scratch the surface of their many Japanese and Korean language hits.

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

Well, at least outside of T-Mobile’s most ardent fans. Yet, here we are at the beginning of 2026, and slowly but surely we seem to be heading in this direction. In 2025, T-Mobile won several awards from major survey companies, including Ookla, and largely became known as the king of network speed . Even AT&amp;T is finally striking harder at the competition , particularly T-Mobile.",

Google has been in overdrive, trying to integrate Gemini and its AI capabilities into all its apps and services. Google Maps has also received its fair share, including the recent Gemini-powered upgrade to walking and cycling navigation .

Credit: Tom Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The Nothing Headphone (a) is reportedly launching on March 12, with pre-orders starting around March 5. It is rumored to cost €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is roughly half of the Headphone 1. The leak suggests four color options: black, white, pink, and yellow. Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November .

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The AYANEO Pocket S Mini retail units will have a 4,700mAh battery, rather than the advertised 6,000mAh. A miscommunication in production caused the mistake, which went unnoticed until today. Buyers can either receive a full refund or a free 2+32GB Pocket AIR Mini with their orders. AYANEO is clearly making an effort to improve its company image, but a major production mistake just torpedoed its efforts to speed up shipping in the worst possible way. Just a few days after the Pocket S Mini was surprisingly put up for sale and set to ship within the same week, it was discovered that one of the main components didn’t match the intended specs. Initially advertised to ship with a 6,000mAh battery, the Pocket S Mini went into urgent production in order to ship before the Chinese New Year, which kicks off next week. However, it was discovered that the retail units slated to start shipping today actually have 4,700mAh batteries.",

She loves it too, especially after it recently got a surprise Android OS update beyond its promised allocation. I’d certainly miss OnePlus if it left the Android smartphone market, but I assumed you might be more split on your level of support for the brand. According to our poll, I may have assumed wrong. As those of you with your finger on the pulse will be aware, we didn’t ask this question as a pure hypothetical. A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole. The crux of his argument in his subsequent article was that, like it or not, the OEM often leads the way with innovations that push its rivals, and that competition in such a huge tech field is generally a good thing.

I decided she needed a replacement, but we agreed it didn’t necessarily need to be a top-tier flagship. We settled on the Galaxy S25 FE (), which I was able to get for under $500. From the moment we set it up, I noticed how familiar this phone felt to my own Galaxy S24, inside and out. After setting it up, I didn’t dwell on it much until about a week or two later, when I asked my daughter if she was okay with the phone still.

Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

While NVIDIA still isn’t ready to publicly commit to a new Shield TV, the company has started sharing a little about what a hypothetical new box might change. One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there. We’ve got our Google fans, who will go with a device like the Google TV Streamer largely because — much like Pixel users with their phones — they want first look at all of Google’s latest features. Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users. They want hardware with versatile ports, the performance to game on their TVs , and they want to buy from a company that’s going to follow through with software support.
