So, with the release of their third studio album Dream Ride , Flip decided to change things up yet again.

Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

Another possible leak suggests the OnePlus 15 might be cheaper due to cost-cutting measures, including a different display and the end of the Hasselblad partnership. OnePlus makes some excellent Android flagships , and the current generation OnePlus 13 checks all the right boxes, so we’re very excited to see what the company has in store for its successor, the OnePlus 15 (Chinese culture regards the number “4” as unlucky). The company recently confirmed that its Hasselblad partnership is over, and that it is building its own DetailMax Engine for photography.

We got a first look at the Galaxy S26 Edge late last week, showing a tweaked design compared to the Galaxy S25 Edge . Now, a different source has revealed renders apparently showing all three Galaxy S26 series models. SmartPrix posted renders that purportedly show the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra . Starting with the Edge model, this design seems broadly in line with the earlier leaked renders. That means two vertically stacked rear cameras in a housing that spans almost the full width of the phone.",

After previously adopting a new naming scheme that removed numbers from the name, Nothing is going back to “straightforward numerical order.” The next earbuds will be called the Ear (3). There’s nothing that London-based electronics maker Nothing loves more than teasers. In typical fashion, the company released a teaser for a new product this morning. The teaser in question is for Nothing’s next-generation flagship TWS earbuds . On X (formerly Twitter), Nothing shared that the Ear (3) would be coming soon. Included in the post is a partial image of the device with the name Ear (3) visible. No release date or other information was provided in the post. Considering how Nothing tends to operate, the launch is probably not far off.",
