    "body": "I've developed what I can only describe as a begrudging respect for Meta's hardware output right now. I've bought almost every Meta headset to date, and unboxing the first one in the Summer of 2020 is definitely a highlight of my VR journey so far. However, Meta's dominance in the market is soured somewhat by Meta itself. Meta AI remains the unwanted present that just keeps on giving, the \" legendary misadventure \" of the metaverse is a multibillion-dollar digital eyesore, and, of course, it has laid off tens of thousands of employees in the process. And this all makes me feel that, frankly, Meta is too comfortable. The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra . Even then, Pico's hardware isn't available in the US and mostly just apes Meta, with very similar specs. Even if the Pico 4 Ultra were to take off and steal back that oh-so coveted market share from Meta, Pico's parent company, Bytedance, is just as data hungry, making it perhaps not the competitor one would want. Valve is a multibillion-dollar company too, but it stays in its lane more and seems content as a corporate entity to just se…",

The game's sequel was released on PS5 earlier this year , with the inevitable PC version yet to be given a release date, while two film adaptations— one live action , one animated —are in the works. Now Hideo Kojima has announced yet another Death Stranding tie-in is being developed for Disney+, and this time it's an anime. Death Stranding Isolations is the working title for the anime, which is due on Disney+ in 2027. Side note: every time the name is mentioned the press release puts \"(Working Title)\" after it, so I hope it's clear this is a working title. Hideo Kojima will act as executive producer on the series while Takayuki Sano, who has a list of anime credits longer than Kojima's Hollywood phonebook, is on directorial duties. The lovely art that accompanied the announcement is by Ilya Kuvshinov (Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045). The anime tells a distinct story within the universe, following a young man and woman on adventure and told through a \"traditional, hand-drawn 2D animation style\" by \"some of Japan’s top animation talent at E&H production\".

Understandably, the idea of having to play through multiple iterations of a game to fully complete it was intimidating, and many people I talked to just didn't have the time for it. Aside from offering to play it through for them so they could just sit back and watch or promising that it didn't feel like a slog when you're actually embroiled in the story of Silent Hill f there wasn't a whole lot I could do to convince them, until now.

Revolutionary stuff. It's also been inspired by the concept of \"a piece of cloth\", which is fairly obvious to see, as that's exactly what it looks like (via BBC News ). The long strap version has also been priced at $230 , a figure that has drawn much ire and ridicule from the online community.

Similar to the mainline games, the objective is to take down the machines, but this time you'll do so as a fully customizable \"machine hunter\" in an open world inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\". It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

    "body": "The Valve Index is a popular headset by most measures, currently used by roughly 15% of players on Steam to play VR. So why is it Valve has killed the Index branding entirely with its latest arrival, a new VR headset called the Steam Frame ? Turns out, it's exactly because Valve doesn't want that sense of continuity between the two. \"This is a new product. That's one of the reasons we changed the name from Valve index to Steam Frame, because we're trying to do something new with this,\" says Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve, during our visit to the company. \"We're really trying to blur the lines from your catalogue, where you just think about, you have your games, this is another device that lets you enjoy them. So I don't want to put too many sort of preconceived expectations on how people will use this.\" The Valve Index is an accessory for a gaming PC. Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so. The Steam Frame contains its own Arm-based processor and runs SteamOS to be able to play games without requiring a second PC. It's a great experience, too, as you can read in my Steam Frame hands-on . \"If you think about the Valve Index, awesome…",

The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community.

I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be.
