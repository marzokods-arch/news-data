New code strings suggest that locked app notifications will show generic “New message” or “New notification” text instead of the usual notification content. It’s unclear whether the app name and icon in the notification will also be hidden. We’re slowly and steadily marching towards the release of Android 17 , which could come with new features such as a long-awaited native App Lock solution. We already have a decent idea of how this rumored feature would work, but there were a few unknowns, one of which was how the feature would handle incoming notifications from locked apps. Thanks to the Android Canary 2601 release , we have an answer. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

    "body": "Credit: Navimow Beautiful, picture-perfect lawns and backyards look fantastic, but anyone who has had to drag around a heavy lawn mower knows how difficult and time-consuming they are to maintain. And even if you went the robot lawn mower route before, installing base stations and perimeter wires is another complicated and tedious chore. Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

It’s called the Clicks Power Keyboard, and it snaps onto the back of your phone via MagSafe/Qi2 magnets — instantly turning your phone into a modern-day BlackBerry. Compared to Clicks’ keyboard cases , the Power Keyboard has a couple of key benefits: 1) You can attach and remove the Clicks Power Keyboard much more easily than a case, and 2) it allows the keyboard to be attach to any phone that has magnets, whether built into it or via a compatible case.",

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.
