Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap .

This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared.

Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display.

In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design.

Special mention is given to Jean-Michel Jarre, who, in his late 20s created the masterpiece Oxygène, an album of sweeping electronic tunes, all of them made on early synthesizers, without a vocal in the mix. Oxygène , released in 1976, and the albums that came after it, including Equinoxe and Zoolook, inspired the French Touch sound which spun around the world and continues to shine.

As that hardware continues to come into focus, we’re at least finding reasons to get excited about Samsung’s latest software, especially as that introduces new changes specifically for Galaxy S26 phones.

Update, December 22, 2025 (2:12 PM ET): Sure enough, those “appliance” vibes we were getting from the teaser video appear to be spot on. Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",

Turning my phone into a Nintendo Switch made it far more fun to play, and it made me swear off touchscreen controls for good. But a few years later, the limitations of telescopic controllers are really starting to grate on me. For starters, they’re not very portable. Early models, like the first Razer Kishi, folded up into a smallish square, but newer models all have the same H-shaped design that doesn’t pack up nearly as neatly. As my bag has slowly filled up with coloring books, crayons, cards, and other things to keep my kids entertained, bag space has increasingly come at a premium.

In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",
