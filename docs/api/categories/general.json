The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).\" As Jacob writes in his exhaustive primer on the memory crisis , the AI boom is largely to blame for jacked up RAM and SSD prices, thanks to AI servers' insatiable hunger for both.

It was all a bit of a flash in the pan, though: A sequel arrived in 2013, both of them fizzled out fairly quickly, they were delisted from Steam several years ago, and honestly I don't think anyone has even thought about them in ages. I certainly haven't. That all changed today, though, because today Skunkape Games announced that Poker Night at the Inventory is coming back in a remastered edition that's set to launch in March. Why, you ask? Well, why not, is my reply, because honestly that's all I can come up with. Poker Night at the Inventory was fine, really, but it was praised more for its humor and character interactions than the actual gameplay, which was a bit flat and buggy. Here, for instance, is a clip of the Heavy regaling his pals with a story about a funny thing that happened at work. It's a good story, yes, but the trouble is that once you'v…",

Coincidentally (or likely not) it's landing right in the middle of season 4 of Bridgerton, the regency era romance TV show that is also all about the scandals of capital 'S' Society. The new expansion essentially puts you in the role of chief gossip columnist Lady Whistledown, uncovering and spreading secrets about the nobility. Gameplay screenshots are from the preview build of Royalty & Legacy which not final and is subject to change . We're all Whistledown now (Image credit: Electronic Arts) The new life aspiration for Royalty & Legacy is \"Social Puppeteer\" with goals like discovering secrets of other sims, extorting them with those secrets, and exposing them to ignite a scandal that damages reputations. Eventually I'm meant to work my way up to finding out secrets about the Robin Hood-like \"Royal Robber\" character and becoming friends with the shady information broker.

It isn't quite that, mind you, but it's easily the biggest update the game has ever had and a marked shift in the vision of what it could be. Starting next week on February 10, Overwatch 2 will drop the 2 and launch the first season of a year-long storyline called The Reign of Talon. Vendetta, the gladiator woman who was recently released as a hero , has taken over the terrorist organization at the heart of Overwatch's near-future story, and the rest of 2026 will explore the fallout of her coup. To tell that story, Blizzard has five (five!) new heroes ready to go: Tank hero Domina, damage heroes Anran and Emre, and support heroes Jetpack Cat and Mizuki. Another five heroes are coming before the end of the year at a rate of one per season.

It's a change that implies that Zen 6 could be a major architectural overhaul as opposed to a relatively minor revision. FRED stands for Flexible Return and Event Delivery. At least, that's what it stands for now. No lesser an authority than Linux creator Linus Torvalds has something to say about that, more on which in a moment. It's a replacement for the decades-old IDT or Interrupt Descriptor Table that dates way back to the Intel 286 processor circa 1982. Both FRED and IDT are instructions for how to handle system events, such as a mouse input or the arrival of a network data packet, also known as interrupts. The technicalities are complicated . But to aggressively simplify the subject, with IDT, the smooth handling of these system events requires software developers to manually manage interrupts over several steps to minimise the risk of multiple interrupts conflicting with each other.

There’s no denying that FromSoftware is the king of the genre, but as far as I’m concerned, Nioh 2 deserves a spot on the Mount Rushmore of soulslikes, nestled between Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring. Don’t get me wrong, it’s got its problems.

That kind of advice was fine six months ago, when DDR5 was genuinely very cheap, but now that a 16 GB kit of DDR5-6000 CL36 costs $200 at Newegg , compared to $370 for 32 GB of the same memory, it surely doesn't make sense to spend the extra $170, when that can be used to get a better graphics card.

According to CEO Dr. Lisa Su , \"Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.\" Previously, Valve had stated that the new Steam Machine would release at some point in 2026, but according to the primary supplier of its internal hardware (it uses a semi-custom AMD RDNA 3 GPU with a Zen 4 CPU), we should be seeing it sometime soon. How early is up for debate, but it looks like it won't be too long until we get one on the bench to test it for ourselves. Valve's new Steam Machine has caused much excitement here at PC Gamer towers, and for good reason. While the original Steam Machines were something of a misstep , Valve's new cuboid compact gaming PC has some promising internals and a host of design features that we're anxious to put to the test. One big question we're hoping will be answered soon is the potential price. All of us on the hardware team had a go at guessing the MSRP of Valve's new baby, but that was at a point when the ongoing memory pricing crisis was still in its infancy.

The tank(destroyer) seats four divers: a driver, a gunner, and two passengers on its shoulders. It's armed with a \"heavy coaxial machinegun\" and a \"120mm high-velocity cannon.\" To put that firepower in perspective: 120mm explosive rounds are the same ordinance that Super Destroyers drop in 120mm missile barrages.
