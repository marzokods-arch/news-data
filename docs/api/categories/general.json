It's back in GOG Preservation Program form. In other words, GOG's done some work on this one. \"The new GOG release of Cold Fear isn’t just a reappearance on a storefront—it’s a quality re-release with extensive under-the-hood work,\" reads the blurb. That means Windows 10/11 support, support for 4K and high refresh rates, modern controller support, and patches for common crashes and glitches—just generally the gubbins you need to launch a game with confidence on a PC in 2025. You can find the full changelog on GOG . Also, it's not alone. Alongside the Cold Fear re-release, GOG's adding Ubisoft's 2012 action-adventure game I Am Alive to its storefront and lineup of preserved titles. That game has gotten a spit-polish too, with support for online achievements, cloud saves, high refresh rates, modern controllers, and various bugfixes and such. As a 2005 game, our review of Cold Fear is lost to the mists of time (that's what we call the closet filled with the last 30-plus years of magazines), but our review of I Am Alive is…",

I came into it with this expectation that it was going to be a simple, easy, plug-and-play, get-it-tested-and-done article. A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on. The model I have here for review is the 18IAX10, complete with Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and RTX 5080 16 GB (capped at a beautiful 1…",

Look at those things. \"Ready up with this controller-meets-clog design that reimagines the iconic Xbox controller with fixed buttons and joysticks into the perfect shoe for couch co-op and kicking back,\" goes the Xbox marketing blurb, like it's describing something perfectly normal and not an abrogation of humanity's duty to treat the Earth's fruits with care and respect. The part I find most displeasing, personally, are the analogue sticks, which arise like malignant fungal nodules from the dorsa of both of your feet.

Today, Ubisoft continued to pretend it never announced the Far Cry series at FX by announcing the Far Cry series at FX. Again.

The Golden Joysticks just wrapped up, The Game Awards are coming, and to kill some time in between you can now nominate your games of choice for the 2025 Steam Awards . I'd actually wondered how Steam Awards nominations would be handled in 2025. Typically it happens during the Steam Autumn Sale, but with Valve moving the Autumn Sale back a couple months to give us a proper break before the Winter Sale hits, that wasn't going to be an option. The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed. There seems to be some kind of obscure eligibility requirements for the recommendation listings, although I haven't been able to suss out exactly what: For the Bes…",

Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue.

In a post on The Crew Unlimited's website (via RPS ), Crew curator whammy4 details what they describe as \"one of the most important updates we've ever released.\" Whammy4 explains that, not long after TCU's launch in September, the team realised that \"if your PC date is set to post June 2029 … The Crew stops working.\" Why anyone would have their PC's date set to beyond June 2029 is beyond me, so I'm not going to call the situation urgent , exactly. But the presence of such a bug will obviously become a much bigger problem in about three-and-a-half years' time. Naturally, The Crew's saviours were \"extremely concerned\" for the long-term health of the game, and investigated further: \"At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end,\" by which whammy4 means the server created by the TCU team to get the game r…",

Alinea estimates that Steam has churned out about $16.2 billion in revenue in 2025, over $4 billion of which went to Valve itself (Valve, notoriously, takes a 30% cut on Steam purchases, a number that only gets lower after your product has raked in over $10 million).

The seemingly Xbox Series X/S-inspired UI, at least on the ROG Xbox Ally X, allows you to access a bunch of different game platforms to launch games, and it runs smoother and snappier than the regular Windows environment.

Kier appeared in over 200 films in the course of a long and remarkable career, and was perhaps best-known for his partnerships with Andy Warhol, Lars von Trier, and Werner Herzog.

So a varied career doesn't even begin to describe Kier's time on screens big and small, but to me he will always, first and foremost, be the utterly magnificent/absurd Yuri from Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge—a Transylvanian psychic who usurped control of the Soviet Union and launched an invasion of the United States, ultimately being defeated in Antarctica and imprisoned in a Psychic Isolation Chamber. Kier's unhinged performance helped define the games and is a big reason they continue to loom so large in the minds of fans.

This card was announced as a celebration of the company's 30th anniversary of selling graphics cards, and it's now officially launched at a price of, er, $4,000 . To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in.

    "body": "Soundtrack Sunday Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday , where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering their thoughts or asking for yours! I am, what scientists and scholars might call, a big fat crybaby. I'll cry at just about anything if you pair it with a mildly sad-sounding violin. Hell, even then I might not need that much convincing. Being moved by just about anything in life is an incredibly blursed lifestyle. Nothing quite gets me bawling like a good videogame, though. Crying alongside protagonists, crying for them. Sobbing for side characters, nameless NPCs, maybe even a creature minding its own business before being mercilessly mowed down by me/an enemy/some omnipotent god. Heck, I'll even cry out of pure joy or excitement for something that's about to happen. And almost every single time, it's thanks to the music that accompanies those moments. I'll never forget the first time I played Final Fantasy 10 and witnessed Tidus and Yuna's scene in Lake Macalania together in all its genuinely mind-blowing 2001 CGI glory. The water reflecting off their faces while Yuna weeps be…",

    "body": "November has been an absolutely huge month for games, between AAA staples like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , ongoing successes like Arc Raiders and Dispatch (both technically released in October, but have each dominated the conversation this month) and indie triumphs like Demonschool . But the game that has hooked me in more than any other this month isn't likely to come up in conversation. Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours. And I've still yet to actually beat it. As I mentioned, Sektori's basic formula is similar to Geometry Wars 3. You control a \"ship\" shaped like an arrow in a shapeshifting arena pro…",

    "body": "Warhammer—End Times: Vermintide celebrated its tenth birthday in October, a fact that makes me painfully aware of how much closer I am to becoming rat fodder myself. The original Vermintide was a decent stab at Left 4 Dead -style cooperative action by developer Fatshark, but much like Valve's pioneering shooter, it has long been eclipsed by its superior sequel. Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\". There's also \"more than Just Skaven\" lurking in the surrounding woods—suggesting you'll encounter some Chaos horde…",

    "body": "Microsoft has made classic text adventures Zork and its sequels open source. The original trilogy (which is actually one huge game that developer Infocom split into three parts) is now available under an MIT License. Microsoft acquired the licence to Zork when it purchased Activision , which in turn nabbed the IP when it bought Infocom back in the '80s. The move to make Zork open source is a combined project between Microsoft, the Xbox Team, and Activision, while Jason Scott, a digital archivist at the Internet Archive, was also involved. Code repositories for Zork , Zork 2 and Zork 3 already exist on Github, having been submitted anonymously several years back. In a blog explaining its decision to make Zork open source, Microsoft says that rather than create new repositories, it has \"officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories\" which \"add a clear MIT License and formally document the open-source grant.\" Microsoft also points out that the license related only to the source code, and \"does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials\". It's a welcome move. However, Microsoft's announcement about making Zork open-source sure has the w…",

    "body": "While the Mafia series has always been more about telling a linear story than letting players explore fully-realised open worlds (with the possible exception of Mafia 3 ) Mafia: The Old Country was even more linear than most. Its story ushered players through its slice of Sicilian countryside in a rather impatient manner, and while its Explore mode technically offered freedom to roam, roaming was all you could do. But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts. Petrolheads can participate in three lap-based circuit races, three linear road sprints, and six time trials. Horses just get three circuit races, though given how little I enjoyed wrangling gee-gees in The Old Count…",
