This year’s promotion includes two separate deals. The first is a $70 discount on all reMarkable 2 bundles, the brand’s crowd-pleasing classic. The reMarkable 2 stays popular because it’s slim, simple, and nails the paper-and-pen-like experience better than many e-ink competitors. The second deal is a $50 discount on all reMarkable Paper Pro bundles, giving the larger, more powerful model a friendlier price tag.

    "body": "TL;DR The Abxylute 3D One is a new gaming handheld with an 11-inch glasses-free 3D screen. It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans. We’ve now spotted one more new feature coming to the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, which could allow users to easily locate their phone with the click of a button.

The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 .

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

Mobile phone thefts, usually snatch-and-grabs, are rising, but thieves reportedly prefer iPhones due to their enhanced resale value.

It’s safe to say that, in 2025, the notion that Android phones are cheaper than iPhones simply isn’t true. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone.

The Translate app may gain a persistent notification, allowing you to continue using Live Translate even if you switch to a different app. Google also appears to be prepping for Live Translate on XR glasses. In August, Google rolled out an update to the Translate app that introduced Live Translation. Powered by Gemini, this feature allows you to have a real-time back-and-forth conversation with others in a different language. Not only are your words converted into another language on screen, but you can also turn on audio playback to hear the translation spoken out loud. In our APK teardown of the Google Translate app, we discovered that several interesting changes are likely to be introduced to this Live Translate feature.

Check if ChatGPT is down Give ChatGPT some time to recover Check your internet connection Log out and log back in Try incognito mode or a different browser Use the ChatGPT smartphone app Clear your browser’s settings and cache Try a ChatGPT alternative Check if ChatGPT is down The first thing you should do is check if the servers hosting ChatGPT itself are down right now or facing connectivity issues.

The camera also adds a variable aperture for better portrait effects and closer zoom. DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",
