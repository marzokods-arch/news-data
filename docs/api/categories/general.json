Things have settled now and the game is holding steady at around 25,000 concurrent players on Steam—which isn't half bad for an early access game still getting its footing. But developer Chief Rebel decided to make up for the shaky launch by giving away nine Halloween skins for free instead of selling them. \"We know that those first few days were really rocky,\" community director Hamish Bode said in an update video about the new Halloween event. \"We just want to have some fun, so let's do this thing.\" From today until November 13, finishing 10 dungeons on each hero will grant you their Halloween-themed skin. Tank players can turn the martial artist Meiko into a jiangshi; damage hero players can give Mara a witch outfit; and healers can drape a bed sheet over the dwarf character Vigour and turn him into a ghost. There are also two broomstick mounts available for a small bit of gold you can earn after a few dungeons. Much like Wor…",

Taking a gander over some of the developer's big sellers for that time period, Monster Hunter Wilds is barely clinging onto the top 10 list, sitting right at the bottom with 637,000 units sold. That's still not bad, mind, but perhaps surprising when framed alongside other games like previous entry Monster Hunter Rise, shifting a skosh more copies at 643,000 units. I am surprised to see Rise beating out Wilds, but not entirely shocked to see the latter struggling behind the rest of Capcom's big hitters. The game continues to sit at a Mixed rating on Steam, thanks in large part to its downright atrocious optimisation (which only feels a hair better eight months after release) which has even left folks with fairly beefy rigs struggling …",

In the latest Steam client beta , Valve announced a handful of changes and fixes, like better Xbox 360 controller mapping in Linux kernel 6.17, fixed timeline markers in game recording, and, most importantly, a new change to chat. Now, when you receive a \"potentially malicious\" message, Valve will add a \"suspicious chat warning that will appear at the top of the chat window.\" Given that Steam launched over two decades ago, and there were millions of dollars put into skins in games like Counter-Strike 2 , it's a bit of a surprise we didn't have this already. Players can emulate others through similar profile pictures or usernames, so it's not out of the question to think bad actors could fake credentials to get access to Steam users. A simple pop-up like this is a good idea for flagging potential bad actors, but it also disables links in chat while the pop-up is available. This means you have to acknowledge the suspicious chat warning to get access to links. Phis…",

With the launch of Season 1 , you can now find radios installed in vehicles in both core Battlefield 6 and the Redsec battle royale—just hold 'Q' to open the command wheel and select a station at the top. That's all well and good; you can listen to beats on the move, and there's nothing quite like dodging mines and rocket barrages while peacefully jamming out. However, what I was not expecting was a paywalled radio station.

Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.
