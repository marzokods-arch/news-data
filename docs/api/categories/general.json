Xiaomi promises four years of Android updates and six years of security patches for these Hyper OS 2 phones. The worsening RAM crisis and resulting price increases have brought mid-range Android phones back into focus, but they also push consumers to demand more from them. Not only are phones expected to be good enough to handle all needs, but they should also be durable enough to withstand everyday wear and tear and the occasional drop. Xiaomi is building on that theme with the launch of the Redmi Note 15 Pro 5G and Redmi Note 15 Pro Plus 5G, promising better durability than ever before in the lineup.

In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

It has a slick UI, built-in cloud saves, RetroAchievements support, and an easy setup process. The app is downloadable for free today, with a Play Store release coming very soon. If you’ve ever dabbled in the world of emulation, you know how quickly your collection can get out of hand. Emulation frontends help keep things nice and organized, but a new app called NeoStation goes above and beyond what traditional frontends like ES DE and Beacon offer, with a plethora of unique features. NeoStation, the brainchild of solo dev Miguel Soto, just hit beta with a slick new UI redesign. After a quick, easy setup (you have to delete the app if you have an older version), it displays all the games on your system, including Android games and apps on mobile devices.",

This could be very useful for many users, but also raises performance concerns due to Chrome’s resource usage. The feature doesn’t seem to be widely available in Chrome Canary yet, but we’re guessing this is a gradual release. Google Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser on PCs, but it also has a reputation for being a resource hog. Now, Google has implemented a toggle that’s convenient in theory, but also means the browser can suck up resources as soon as you start your computer. Chrome expert Leopeva64 reported on Twitter that Chrome Canary now offers an Open Chrome when my computer starts toggle on Windows. The toggle, which is apparently off by default but functional, opens a Chrome window as soon as you boot up your PC. The toggle can be found by tapping Settings &gt; On startup &gt; Open Chrome when my computer starts . Check out a screenshow below, via the tipster.",

OnePlus added that it will restore the ability to downgrade in its next regular software update. OnePlus drew the ire of some enthusiasts last week when it emerged that new firmware for select devices introduced Anti-Rollback Protection (ARB). This hardware-level protection measure means users would brick their devices if they tried to downgrade the software or install a custom ROM. Fortunately, OnePlus has revealed that this isn’t a permanent state of affairs. OnePlus told Android Authority in an emailed response that this was a temporary measure to boost security:",

You will be able to buy it starting later this week through Samsung’s online and select offline stores in the US. The TriFold’s 512GB variant is priced at $2,899. The recently unveiled Galaxy Z TriFold is an impressive piece of technology. While the design and the heft may feel less practical than a standard book-style foldable, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the limitations are easily offset by its utility. The TriFold is essentially a large Android tablet that fits in your pocket, and it may be the perfect device if you fancy using three apps side-by-side. And if you’re in the US and have been waiting to lay your hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, we have good news. As promised , Samsung is officially bringing the Galaxy Z TriFold to the US, and eager customers will be able to buy it starting Friday, January 30. The pricing for the Galaxy Z TriFold with 512GB storage is set at $2,899, and it will be available through Samsung’s online and offline retail stores. The Korean market also gets a 1TB variant, so we hope to hear a bit more about its availability in the US.",

The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access. At the time, we didn’t know exactly what this new UI would look like, whether the favorited passes would be highlighted on the Wallet app’s home screen, or appear directly on the phone’s home screen. Thanks to a recent Google Wallet update, we now have a much better idea of how favoriting passes would work in the new UI.
