It’s not like a camera or a fingerprint reader, where you instantly know why it’s part of your device. It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

    "body": "TL;DR With Android 16 QPR2, Google’s moving the Chrome URL share button to a more convenient location. In Android Canary 2512, Google has removed several UI options for working with images through the Recents screen. Update, December 10, 2025 (02:00 AM ET): The article mistakenly mentioned that Android 16 QPR2 removed some functionality in the Recents screen. These changes are in the Android Canary 2512 release. The error is regretted, and the article below has been corrected accordingly. Original article, December 9, 2025 (01:56 PM ET): What’s worse than Google removing a genuinely useful feature from Android? Well, a few things, certainly, but high on that list we’d have to put “not even realizing the tool existed until it’s already being removed.” And sadly, that may be the case for a lot of you with this neat trick in Android’s Recents screen.",

If you’ve been waiting for Samsung to catch up with the magnetic features iPhone users have had for years, your patience is about to pay off. A new leak about the Galaxy S26 accessories shows Samsung is fully committing to the Qi2 wireless charging standard .

    "body": "Nicolas Escurat A flash of lightning, and then—something else. High above a storm, a crimson figure blinks in and out of existence. If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.

Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G.

Motorola’s 2026 lineup might stick to familiar designs but introduce small refinements across both the next-gen Moto G Stylus and Bluetooth tracker. The Edge 70 Ultra may also join the stylus club, though it’s unclear if it’ll feature a built-in silo or rely on accessories. Motorola looks like it’s heading into 2026 with quiet rather than big changes. New leaks about the Moto G Stylus 2026 and its Moto Tag successor reveal designs that appear familiar, with only slight differences. It looks like Motorola is sticking with what works, focusing even more on texture and how the next Moto G Stylus feels in the hand, and a new image from Android Headlines shows a device that looks a lot like last year’s model.",

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

A more advanced follow-up to the surprisingly popular Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses (), the new glasses have a monocular display (meaning there’s one screen in one of the lenses), a Neural Band wrist strap that lets you control what you see by performing air gestures, and, most importantly, a price: $799. While expensive, this kept Meta at the forefront of the burgeoning XR revolution by making it the first major tech player to have a retail-ready set of smart glasses that seem to bring us the future Google Glass promised us over 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Meta, there are three major problems with the new Ray-Bans.
