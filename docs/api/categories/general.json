And we&#8217;re going to call it Don’t Go in That House, Bi&#8211;h! And he’s going to star in it.” He added: “People keep going in the house. People don’t listen. &#8216;What are you doing, bi&#8211;h? Don’t go in that house!&#8217; People just keep going in. Like, &#8216;What are you doing? You’re not going to come out of there.

However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. An unsung fashion hero we don&rsquo;t see getting the credit she deserves is Charli XCX. The &ldquo;Everything is romantic&rdquo; singer has gone through changes in her style journey over her almost 15-year-long music career. In her early days, the British star was extremely experimental, dabbling in more maximalist silhouettes in her hyperpop era with albums like 2013&rsquo;s True Romance and 2017&rsquo;s Pop 2 . Her style was defined by prints, eye-catching colors and unexpected silhouettes that slowly but surely began to change with the release of Crash , which she dropped in 2022. With that album, Charli&rsquo;s style went through an evolution, focusing less on the maximalist, although there were colorful moments, and leaning into a grungier aesthetic. With Brat in 2024, the singer stuck to neutrals, mostly black, sometimes with pops of that neon green mixed in. This unique evolution can be tracked in-depth with the book Icons of Style: Charli X…",
