The rest of the photos and videos chronicle their holiday cheer, concluding with a tender image in which Blanco is bent over putting a bit of bling on a lower branch as Gomez gently places her hand on his signature head of curly hair.

The transaction, structured as a cash-and-stock deal valued at $27.75 per Warner share, places Warner’s enterprise value at approximately $82.7 billion. The deal is expected to close in late 2026, following Warner’s planned spin-off of its Discovery Global cable operations into a separate publicly traded company.

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

The energy was back for me,” she tells Billboard over a Zoom. “I just really had a lot to give in a more extroverted way where the last album felt very introverted. That was how I’ve been feeling. I’ve been feeling so strong.” Much has happened in Wonderland’s life since 2022’s Loner , which crashed Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums tally at No. 3 and started at No. 9 on the ARIA Chart, her third consecutive top 10. Later that year, Wonderland (real name: Alexandra Sholler) launched FMU Records, and, in 2023, revived her darker, more industrial project Whyte Fang, with the release of a full-length album, Genesis .

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade.

As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

Pricing and availability haven’t been announced. For the past few years, Motorola’s been teaming up with Pantone, whose proprietary color matching system has become a widely used standard, to make an annual phone featuring the company’s Color of the Year. Moto announced the latest in that series today — and it’s surprisingly dull. Pantone’s 2026 Color of the Year is called Cloud Dancer (number 11-4201 in Pantone’s system), a light gray. On its own, Cloud Dancer looks like plain white, but it does have some contrast against a true paper white. Moto’s made a special edition of its Edge 70 featuring a Cloud Dancer-colored finish and crystals from jewelry maker Swarovski .",

The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode.

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference.

These features are currently exclusive to Google Workspace users, which includes enterprise users and those with Gemini subscriptions.

In addition to the Gemini gateway (part of the Google app) on Android, the assistant has, or at least some features powered by it have, slowly crept up into other Google apps, including Messages, Photos , Home , and more. For Workspace users specifically, Google also adds Gemini-based assistive features to Gmail, Drive, and the office suite, gently reminding them of its capabilities . Now, Google is expanding its prowess in Drive, offering more insights into a folder’s contents and even sharing an overview of the files and subfolders stored inside.
