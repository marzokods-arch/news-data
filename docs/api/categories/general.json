    "body": "Diane Keaton , the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall , The Godfather films and Father of the Bride , whose quirky, vibrant manner and depth made her one of the most singular actors of a generation, has died. She was 79. People first reported Saturday (Oct. 11) that she died in California with loved ones, citing a family spokesperson. No other details were immediately available, and representatives for Keaton did not immediately respond to inquiries. The unexpected news was met with shock around the world. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her “La-dee-da, la-dee-da” phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family. Her star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades thanks in part to a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Nancy Meyers.
