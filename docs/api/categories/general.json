But it also seems to be awfully hard to do away with: A new Bloomberg report says Naughty Dog has been pushing employees to work at least eight extra hours per week since late October in order to finish an internal demo of its upcoming sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Intergalactic was revealed at The Game Awards 2024 with a long cinematic that landed (for me, at least) as kind of a mashup of Uncharted with Ready Player One, in space: Porsche-branded ship, Sony audio player, anime on the TV, and Pet Shop Boys on CD. Studio boss Neil Druckmann later said the game, despite its clear action trappings, is \" about faith and religion ,\" which is an interesting pitch, but we really haven't heard anything about it since.

I'm all for fighting fake creatures, of course—I wouldn't have spent a decade scrapping lizards for their parts in Monster Hunter otherwise. But sometimes it's just nice to look. Pokémon Snap did have a problem, however: Professor Oak thought it was fine to pay with exposure. No matter how many valuable shots of Pikachu I sent him, it didn't put any cash in my pocket that I might have spent on cool hats or shirts. Thankfully, there's finally a game willing to properly reward my talents in wildlight photography: Flock Around, a multiplayer photography game that brings friendslop a Peak-like experience to birdwatching. (Image credit: Secret Plan Games) After firing up the Flock Around demo on Steam and customizing my genre-standard colorful beanshaped avatar, I soon learned something about birds: They're harder to photograph than Pokémon.

You can find Tomo's lost cat in the Goblin Cave , but it's locked behind the Goblin King quests in the Forgotten Kingdom. If you've already completed his five tasks, then you should be able to unlock the door in an alcove to the right of the king and enter the cave. After entering the Goblin Cave, cross the bridge and pass through the waterfall. You'll enter a stony nook that looks empty, but you should be able to pass through the back wall by running against it.

Never again will you need to burden yourself with pressing buttons once you get this build going as it's powerful enough to do everything in the game. Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake. Outside of pushing into the high tiers of Diablo 4's hardest dungeons, this build only requires you to walk into enemies.

I use the inverted commas because, cute and cool as it was, the question of whether the rats were really playing Doom in any meaningful way, or just running on a ball for some delicious sugar water, was not conclusively answered. The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom. The new setup still maps the rat's real-world movement into a Doom environment, b…",

Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America.

The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties.

According to the analysts at Newzoo , the games industry is expected to outpace expectations to reach record-breaking revenue growth by the year's end. \"The global games market is expected to reach $197 billion in 2025, growing +7.5% year on year,\" said Newzoo's Tianyi Gu in a press release detailing the firm's preemptive analysis of January-November 2025 trends ahead of its full end of year global games market report . \"This represents an upward revision to earlier forecasts, driven primarily by stronger-than-expected performance on PC and mobile.\" (Image credit: Newzoo) While PC gaming is only expected to generate about half of the $108 billion revenue produced by the quiet, unfathomable churn of mobile games, Newzoo predicts the PC gaming market will have grown an impressive 10.4% by the end of the year. \"PC gaming is expected to generate $43 billion (+10.4 percent YoY),\" Newzoo said. \"A strong slate of pre…",

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

Justin Theroux, who plays Robert House (one of the apparently two Robert Houses that have appeared in the show so far) may have just tipped us off to an exciting upcoming Fallout: New Vegas cameo. The revelation took place on the \"Fake Fallout Talkshow,\" which you'll find hidden on Prime TV's Fallout show page on the \"Extras\" tab. It's a short talk show—a fake one—hosted by comedian and actor Jon Daly as his \"Snake Oil Salesman\" character, the shady vagabond best known for having sex with chickens and giving Thaddeus the elixir that ghoulified him. There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.
