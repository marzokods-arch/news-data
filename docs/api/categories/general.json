The Afro-house track about a forbidden desire, which samples Aventura’s “Los Infieles,” marked the first taste of the Puerto Rican and Colombian artists&#8217; joint album Stendhal . The 14-track production, produced by Colombian hitmaker Ovy on the Drums and others, is rooted in the Afrolatino fusion with other global genres such as reggaetón, kizomba, electronic, and dembow. Tracks such as “Pikito,” “El Volcán,” “Cookie,” and “Explícito” evoke sensual and provocative emotions. In others, they pay homage to timeless Latin tunes: “Ale” is inspired by Fernando Villalona’s “Carnaval (Baile en la Calle)”;&nbsp; “Te Culié” by Las Ketchup’s “Asereje”; and “Antes de Irme” by Xuxa’s “Ilaríe.” The album’s name, Stendhal , is inspired by Stendhal Syndrome, where the art of great beauty prof…",

The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to bring a major redesign for its system apps. Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect.

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

    "body": "TL;DR Motorola has announced its latest Pantone Color of the Year collaboration. The companies teamed up to make a special-edition Motorola Edge 70 in Cloud Dancer, a very light gray. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced. For the past few years, Motorola’s been teaming up with Pantone, whose proprietary color matching system has become a widely used standard, to make an annual phone featuring the company’s Color of the Year. Moto announced the latest in that series today — and it’s surprisingly dull. Pantone’s 2026 Color of the Year is called Cloud Dancer (number 11-4201 in Pantone’s system), a light gray. On its own, Cloud Dancer looks like plain white, but it does have some contrast against a true paper white. Moto’s made a special edition of its Edge 70 featuring a Cloud Dancer-colored finish and crystals from jewelry maker Swarovski .",

The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode.

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

We’ve managed to enable the feature for the first time in version 7.56.0.839465534 of the app. Touch Up includes six face retouching options to edit everything from your eyes and teeth to eyebrows, lips, and more. Google Photos is one of the best photo editing apps out there, but one thing it’s never had is a way to retouch specific parts of your face. While the Camera has had the face retouching feature for years, the Photos app has never supported targeted editing. That’s finally changing, and we can now show you how.",

In 2025, the browser effectively morphed into a proactive operating system of its own, powered by a surge in on-device and cloud-based AI.

Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference.
