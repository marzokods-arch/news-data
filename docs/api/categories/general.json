The new Larian RPG, which is just called Divinity , is probably not going to require you to be up-to-date on the series lore. But the series has a lot to offer for the curious, even if the games do get pretty crusty the further back you go. Here's what Baldur's Gate 3 fans and anyone else interested in the next big Larian RPG should know about Divinity. What are the games in the Divinity series? What order should you play the Divinity games in? Rather than experiencing the Divinity games chronologically by release date, or according to the internal timeline of the series, we suggest investigating them in reverse order of release . That has you starting with the best of them and working backwards until they get too crusty for you. So our recommendation is: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Divinity: Original Sin Divinity: Dragon Commander (If you're into strategy games) Divinity 2: Ego Draconis Beyond Divinity (you can skip this one u…",

    "body": "When I flew to China to play Phantom Blade Zero earlier this year, I left without one key piece of information: When it would be out. The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

Can we speculate about the timeline at all? Surely we can narrow it down to something more specific than sometime in the next decade. Back in April 2025, about eight months before revealing Divinity, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the studio was \" deep in the trenches \" with its next project.

Resident Evil actor Milla Jovovich, who was also on stage to promote her role as the next Hitman Elusive Target , had to get in on the abs talk, asking \"they are based on reality, right?\" \"Yes they are,\" Kravitz said. \"That's not a body double.\" It turns out that 'based on reality' is actually underselling…",

They've done it in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development. \"The power of independent, self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing, and I think, positive theme in our industry. …",

We're about due for more details, even a gameplay trailer⁠—we last got official word from Arkane Lyon at the 2023 Game Awards with Blade's debut teaser.

Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

Kind of in the way two guys with meticulously groomed moustaches will give a knowing nod when they walk past each other in the street. Upon watching arcade racer Screamer's latest narrative-focused trailer at The Game Awards, the first thing I thought to myself was, \"Huh, this absolutely feels like a fighting game.\" A tournament bringing unlikely individuals together in the pursuit of a larger, evil entity? Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters. And then our QA people are the Tekken guys. We also like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear —we really like them. Even the weird ones…",

A game developed as the PC's answer to Namco's Ridge Racer before its sequel delved more into rally racing. The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning. But I can assure you that we have decided to do this while keeping in mind the essence of the original Screamer, which was a very fast racing game with a lot of adrenaline in it, in every race.

But it looks positively sick, and I had to do a double take to realize it's a follow up to one of the biggest games of the past few years. Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding. Before things fade to black, we get the disturbing sight of some kind of zombified half-torso thing emerging from the water. \"Do I have to have played Forest 1 and Forest 2 to get Forest 3?\" I quipped to the PC Gamer work chat.

Almost nothing has been left untouched over the course of its seasonal updates and system overhauls. But with the launch of its next expansion, I think its era of constant reworks will finally be over. On April 28, its second expansion, Lord of Hatred, will launch and bring with it a new campaign, a new region to explore, two new classes (including paladins ), and several features players have been asking for since the game came out. They're the kind of things that simply wouldn't work in the game it used to be. A great example of this are loot filters, which are finally coming in Lord of Hatred. I'll admit, I used to be against the idea given how important churning through loot is in Diablo games. But with the changes to items in the current season and the new ways to craft gear into exactly what you want, I'm sold on the ability to sort your items before you even pick them up. It's a common feature in other action RPGs to let you customize what items you see on the ground so you get that jolt of excitement when something good does drop…",

Paladins won't be the only new class coming with Lord of Hatred, however. Blizzard says there's one more that will launch with the expansion, but it's keeping it a secret for now. \"The paladin is our knight, is our holy warrior. It's our sword and board class that is empowered by their faith,\" senior combat designer Dominick Sileo says in a video Blizzard provided to PC Gamer. A blend of Diablo 2's paladin and Diablo 3's crusader, the Diablo 4 paladin has four distinct fighting styles split up into different oaths you can choose from.

The trailer showcased large, angry, heavily bespectacled bad guy Victor Gideon, apparently a once-respected doctor who sure seems to be having a rough time of things more recently. The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain.
