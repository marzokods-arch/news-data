    "body": "TL;DR Some Android Auto users report Google Maps losing the car icon when switching back to split-screen mode. Navigation still works, but the car marker disappears until Maps is force-closed on the phone. Several users say switching back to the default blue arrow icon may stop the issue, at least for now. Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

A new report now reveals how big a financial hit Disney’s sports broadcasting arm suffered due to the blackout. ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: AYANEO TL;DR The AYANEO Pocket S Mini is available now to order, and it’s in stock and ready to ship. Previous handhelds have faced significant delays in crowdfunding, so this is a welcome change. The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

As color E-Ink tablets edge closer to traditional tablets, Bigme has officially announced the B10. The generously sized device is positioned as a productivity-first tablet for reading, writing, and, with an optional keyboard, light work. The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools. The device also supports varied text input, with stylus support for handwriting and sketching, plus an optional magnetic keyboard case.

The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.
