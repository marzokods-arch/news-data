    "body": "Tim McGraw is bringing a touch of country to the National Hockey League. The country superstar will make history when he headlines the 2026 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series outdoor game next month at Raymond James Stadium. McGraw will perform during the first intermission on Feb. 1, as the hometown Tampa Bay Lightning takes on the Boston Bruins, for what will mark the first time that an outdoor NHL game will be played in a football stadium in the state of Florida. The stadium is, of course, home of the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the two-time Super Bowl champions. McGraw is no stranger to hockey. The three-time Grammy Award winning artist has strong ties with the Nashville Predators, whose goal celebrations typically include a blast of McGraw’s 1995 single &#8220;I Like It, I Love It.&#8221; The artist and his wife Faith Hill are frequently spotted in the audience at home games, and the Predators have promoted the singer and songwriter with limited-edition bobbleheads for fans. For the special event, a regulation-size rink will be built inside a steel-framed, air-conditioned tent to protect it from the elements, according to the league. The structure will be 34 feet hi…",

When the said build reaches more users, they could experience a more responsive and fluid interface on their phones. The upgrade could also improve battery backup on existing phones. Many of the changes and improvements that One UI 8.5 is slated to bring have been limited to visual aspects of the interface. While Samsung is also expanding support for external hardware and giving you greater control over some crucial settings , it may also be working to improve the overall performance. According to leaker Ice Universe, Samsung has also updated the kernel in the recent One UI 8.5 beta builds. With the specified “CZAA” build, which is likely leaked or unreleased, the Galaxy S25 Ultra jumps from Linux kernel version 6.6.77 to 6.6.98. According to the leaker, that’s a jump of more than 21 Linux kernel versions and could lead to a noticeable difference in the interface’s fluidity when the build is released broadly.",

The update isn’t out yet, and the existing version also appears half-baked, suggesting some wait time before it arrives for users. Remix is one of the most exciting features in Google Photos . You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them.

In Australia, the so-called “cap” prevents the recording industry from negotiating a new, higher rate on those sound recording royalties paid by commercial radio, a sum fixed at 1% of gross industry revenue, and legislated in the 1968 Copyright Act. Currently, commercial radio pays an industry-wide license fee of 0.4%. That comes to roughly A$4.4 million ($2.94 million), from an industry earning around A$1 billion in annual advertising revenue, according to PPCA, the not-for-profit collecting society that licenses businesses and broadcasters to play commercially-released sound recordings. In the separate case of the publicly-funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the cap is 0.5 cents per head of population, for a total annual sum of just A$125,000 ($84,000).

We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds.

Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups.

While some, like controversial hip-hop mogul Irv Gotti —&nbsp;who co-founded the influential label Murder Inc., home to such 2000s stars as Ashanti and Ja Rule — and Brandon Blackstock , the artist manager and ex-husband of Kelly Clarkson, were well-known to the public, most were not — even as their work reached mainstream attention and even helped shape the music industry of the future.

Google first started moving Pixel phone production from China to Vietnam in 2019, and the company has continued to shift production from China to both Vietnam and India. Now, the company could actually do more than produce Pixel phones outside China. Nikkei Asia reports that Google plans to both develop and manufacture high-end Pixel phones in Vietnam in 2026.

If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following up on its preview last week, the company is now disclosing details about the products. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",

It addresses shipping delays, poor customer service, quality control, and more. The company has also delayed the Pocket Play campaign while it works to implement the changes. AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott. After a poorly received initial response , AYANEO’s CEO stepped in to provide a full statement and “ Service Improvement Plan ” to turn things around in 2026.",

Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",
