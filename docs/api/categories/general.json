When designing the Collector, it was important to the dev team that it would be \"distinct from Leviathans in our previous Subnautica games,\" Cory Strader, the visual development lead, explains in the dev diary. \"We started with multiple rounds of quick, low-detail thumbnail sketches, exploring a wide range of shapes and silhouettes. And out of all of the designs, this Cthulhu-inspired beast resonated with the team.\" (Image credit: Krafton) It certainly looks like the kind of thing that would make my soul leave my body while venturing too far into the deep waters of Subnautica. And crucially, it doesn't just look terrifying; it's also extremely dangerous to players. \"Our main goal with creatures was to make them feel reactive,\" Antonio Munoz Gallego, gameplay lead engineer, says. \"The creature is constantly re-evaluating the situation in real time.\" Accor…",

This week I played a few hours of Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm, two maps that Battlefield Studios has been talking up as representative of Battlefield 6's scale. Even though I've played dozens of hours of multiplayer at this point, this Battlefield 6 demo felt personally make-or-break: EA's focus on small maps (and one medium) in the open beta was a letdown, and it helped fuel the impression that it's more interested in converting Call of Duty players than winning back Battlefield long-timers. That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core. Mirak Valley is a spacious, intimidating war zone. The middle lane is a gauntlet of villages and battle-worn trenches that collide at the center in a massive construction site overseen by a precariously placed crane.

With comfortable textured grips, a great feel, a sturdy build, and a classic look, it's still a bit of a banger five years after its Xbox Series X refresh. That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",

Pretty good hit rate, and the numbers come from developer Gearbox itself, which has released a loot package for all players to celebrate… erm, all the looting. The rewards come in the form of a Shift code, Gearbox's little data-hoovering service that it uses because it can, and is called the Break Free Pack.

I guess that, and only that, is why I'm not Margot Robbie, who is the one Hollywood has actually tapped to make a The Sims movie for some reason, and whose production company is set to draw inspiration for the project from the Barbie film and the Lego Movie (via The Direct ). That's per one of the film's producers, Roy Lee, who told The Direct that \"Somewhere in-between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be.\" Which, great. Let me read that a few more times to see if I can figure out what it means. Nope, no luck. Okay, let me try to break it down for myself. I think we can take from this that The Sims movie will be something resembling a comedy, probably a family movie rather than a straightforward kids' film, and that its humour will be pretty universal but maybe dip into the more esoteric every now and then—you know, like the bit where Barbie chats about fascism.

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack. It's creative, it's charming, and it genuinely bridges the gap between two wildly different games. (Image credit: Funday Games) As the swarms chase you, you're able to shape the landscape around you against them. For anyone who's been following that early access journey, the 1.0 release won't come as any startling reinvention.

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box .

The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick.

As a case in point, redditor Substantial-Mark-959 reports they've come into possession of an early engineering sample of the RTX 2080 Ti , and it looks to be of a significantly higher spec than the release card. One Founders Edition BIOS and a modified Nvidia driver later, and Substantial-Mark-959 says they've been able to get the card up and running. The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card. Got my hands on a engineering GTX 2080ti. from r/nvidia For reference, the release version of the RTX 2080 Ti has 4352 shaders, 88 ROPs, and 272 TMUs. That'd make this particular sample slightly quicker in theory, especially as it has a 384 bit bus width compared to the standard card's 352-bit version. With the cooler removed, the chip itself looks a lot like the stock TU102 die—although as another eagle-eyed redditor has noticed, it doesn't have any markings showing the model designation. So, why did we end up with a less-powerfully-specced variant in the…",

Completing it all once is all well and good, but you won't want to trudge through every single quest again on an alternate character. That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

The Zenaim Arcade Controller Button Module Kit (via PC Watch ) is set to launch in Japan on September 25 for 29,700 yen which, according to Google's currency conversion, works out to $202 at the time of writing. Not cheap, then, but I bet if you're in the market for something like this, you wouldn't have been expecting something particularly cheap anyway. It includes buttons, a circuit board, and cables (or 'harnesses', according to machine translation) to connect the two. So it's not exactly a hot swappable affair, more of a 'replace all the internals of your fight stick chassis' kind of deal.
