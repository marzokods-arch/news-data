    "body": "After four months of KPop Demon Hunters at No. 1 on the Top Gabb Music Songs chart, the monthly ranking has two new stars for November 2025: Alex Warren and NF . Warren&#8217;s &#8220;Ordinary&#8221; is the tally’s latest No. 1, while NF boasts eight entries on the 25-position chart, the most of any artist at one time since its inception. Billboard has partnered with Gabb Wireless, a phone company for kids and teens, to present a monthly chart tracking on-demand streams via its Gabb Music platform. Gabb Music offers a vast catalog of songs, all of which are selected by the Gabb team to include only kid- and teen-appropriate content. Gabb Music streams are not currently factored into any other Billboard charts. First, “Ordinary.” The song debuted on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 in February and began a 10-week run at No. 1 in June, and it first appeared on Top Gabb Music Songs in April, rising to No. 2 in June — the month before the KPop Demon Hunters dominance on the list began.

Portable gaming hardware keeps getting more and more powerful, and the aptly-named Super X is here to bring desktop-level power to a two-in-one tablet design. It isn’t cheap, but it blows traditional devices like the Surface Pro out of the water. The OneXPlayer Super X packs up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 128GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful devices you can buy. It’s far from the only device with this chipset, but its killer feature is that it can transform between a tablet and a laptop. There’s a kickstand in the back, which, paired with the magnetic keyboard included with early bird purchases, turns it into a real portable powerhouse.",

With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

You can connect by opening the Second Screen page on the phone and pressing “Windows + K” on your PC to find the device. With the Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has finally delivered on the original promise of foldable phones : a device that truly transforms from a phone into a tablet. When folded, you interact with a standard 6.5-inch cover display, but unfolding it reveals a massive 10-inch screen. The inner display is so large, in fact, that the software treats it like a tablet, even enabling standalone Samsung DeX directly on the device.

The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031.

Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house.

    "body": "TL;DR With Android 16 QPR2, Google’s moving the Chrome URL share button to a more convenient location. In Android Canary 2512, Google has removed several UI options for working with images through the Recents screen. Update, December 10, 2025 (02:00 AM ET): The article mistakenly mentioned that Android 16 QPR2 removed some functionality in the Recents screen. These changes are in the Android Canary 2512 release. The error is regretted, and the article below has been corrected accordingly. Original article, December 9, 2025 (01:56 PM ET): What’s worse than Google removing a genuinely useful feature from Android? Well, a few things, certainly, but high on that list we’d have to put “not even realizing the tool existed until it’s already being removed.” And sadly, that may be the case for a lot of you with this neat trick in Android’s Recents screen.",

If you’ve been waiting for Samsung to catch up with the magnetic features iPhone users have had for years, your patience is about to pay off. A new leak about the Galaxy S26 accessories shows Samsung is fully committing to the Qi2 wireless charging standard . For the last few generations, Android users have had to rely on third-party MagSafe-compatible sticker rings or cases for a secure wireless charging connection.
