    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google has revealed its top Chrome extensions of 2025, highlighting a shift toward AI companions that sit inside your workflow. Add-ons like Monica and Sider stole the show, allowing users to chat with PDFs, summarize web pages, and draft content without ever leaving their current tab. Not everything is AI-first: Adobe brings Photoshop-style editing straight into Chrome, and Phia simplifies shopping by auto-comparing prices in the background. There was a time when web browsers simply let you view the internet. Those days are long gone. In 2025, the browser effectively morphed into a proactive operating system of its own, powered by a surge in on-device and cloud-based AI. Google has now rounded up its favorite extensions of 2025, and the list paints a very clear picture: extensions are becoming the real engine of Chrome.

Almost all the songs on the album, including the viral summer song &#8220;El Caballito,&#8221; were produced by Gangsta. However, many have been familiar with Gangsta&#8217;s work since Kapo&#8217;s breakout hits &#8220;Ohnana&#8221; and &#8220;UWAIE.&#8221; He worked on almost all of the artist&#8217;s latest album, Por Si Alguien Nos Escucha , and was behind songs on Ryan Castro&#8217;s albums Sendé and Hopi Sendé , such as &#8220;La Villa,&#8221; which features both artists. The Kapo-Ryan Castro union is also present in “Dónde”, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Colombia Hot 100 chart in its first week and continues to stand out in the top 20 of the chart.

Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware.

The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70.
