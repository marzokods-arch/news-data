Of course, using the same gear as Faker isn't going to suddenly make you too a four-times League of Legends World Champion, but at the very least if you're matching the gaming setups that the professionals use you can't use that as an excuse. You're just going to have to use them to git gud. I've picked out three of the main categories of esports, FPS (Valorant, CS2, Fornite), MOBA (League of Legends, DOTA 2), and sports (Rocket League, FC25), and picked the most popular gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, and gaming headset from what the highest proportion of professional gamers use. It is worth noting that sponsorship and platform plays a big part of this, where Logitech sponsors a lot of the MOBA pros and the PS5 is the de facto platform for something like FC25, so the DualSense is the automatic choice for the pros.

Kunos handed over the vehicle handling physics and other technical data, then Supernova gave a stoic nod, loaded up Unreal Engine 5, and promptly set to work building a game that will ruthlessly dissolve any ego you had about being handy in the gravel.

Speaking to Variety , Xbox president Sarah Bond says that you can blame Asus for that one, as the pricing was based on its feedback. \"We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware,\" said Bond. \"That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices. \"I feel really good about the value that we're giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware.\" It's been well-received by reviewers overall, that's for sure.

    "body": "Welcome to the PC Gamer Top 100—our annual list of the best games you can play right now. For the last few months, the PC Gamer team has been busy whittling down the hundreds of thousands of games available on PC; campaigning, voting and arguing until we arrived at the 100 games you'll find below. It's a list designed to represent the passion of our global team of over 30 writers and editors. If you're wondering why Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is back on the list for the first time in years, it's because Josh made a fully animated powerpoint presentation that he delivered to the team while dressed up as a pirate. Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic—a game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece—the pinnacle of its chosen genre? In truth, the answer is that can be any or al…",

After telling fans (in the form of a random guy on X) that he was still working on translating United Front Games' magnum opus to the silver screen, he's returned to tell us the draft of its script is officially complete. The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on—if you've somehow forgotten—2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far. Liu says that's not the case, though. \"[Square Enix is]…",

The announcement trailer, shown above, starts with a direct trailer for the TV show before cutting to executive producer at Marvel games Danny Koo and head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios Brad Winderbaum. It's a very 'we are reading a press release off a teleprompter' video, but it did reveal some key details about the upcoming mode. Players will get to hop in as Thor, Magik, Blade, the Punisher, and—Jeff the Shark. One of these things is not like the others, though I'm personally very excited to see that cute little guy chew through hordes of the undead. This also implies that Jeff is somehow immune to the Hunger, which is concerning. Maybe he only wants to eat other sharks.

Everywhere was hugely ambitious and backed by the staggering sums that Benzies' reputation could attract: Barb had raised £233 million by 2024, and by the end of that year boasted 448 staff. But it didn't have a game it could release and, with Everywhere's ambitious scope, a decision was made at some point to shift focus to MindsEye, which had begun as an in-game experience that was part of Everywhere. MindsEye released in June this year and has been a disaster. Within weeks of the game's launch there was news of mass layoffs at Barb, the true scale of which is only now becoming clear.

That's not exactly a smoking gun, given that Del Rey has an album coming out and this could be an unrelated song that just happens to have the same name. But come on, Lana Del Rey would be a perfect fit for a Bond theme of the smoky Nancy Sinatra variety. I reckon she could manage a brassier Shirley Bassey-type song too. And it would be justice for the fact she wrote a theme for Spectre that ultimately went unused in favor of Sam Smith's song, Writing's On the Wall. (The song Del Rey wrote for it was eventually released under the name 24 , Spectre being the 24th Bond movie.) After seeing 30 minutes of 007 First Light gameplay , our Tyler Wilde came away surprised by how impressive the shooting was. While there's gunplay in IO Interactive's Hitman games, it's never been the main attraction—if you end up going loud it's usually because something's gone wrong. When the reckless young James Bond of First Light goes loud, complete with Max Payne slow-mo, it see…",

It cast you as an amnesiac trapped in a hospital full of zombies and giant worms you had to defeat with various guns and a nightstick. Nintendogs this ain't. Developer Renegade Kid originally pitched it to Konami as a Silent Hill game. As director Jools Watsham told NintendoLife , \"The person I met with from Konami was rather dismissive and said something to the effect of, 'We wouldn’t give the Silent Hill IP to a team like yours'. It was quite surprising and very disheartening.\" Renegade Kid tried again years later, using the engine from Dementium 2 to mock up a third-person game to pitch to Konami. \"Konami's response that time wasn't dismissive like the first time,\" Watsham told IGN . \"They simply didn't want to venture into the DS space with a horror title at that time.\" The trailer sure makes Dementium look a lot more like Doom 3 than Silent Hill 2, so I can't say I'm disappointed Renegade Kid had to come up with their own mythos rather than borrowing Silent…",

The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map. As a series veteran, I think it's safe to say that none of these maps are particularly large, and I do hope we get more diversity going forward.

The 1.0 update introduces multiple significant changes to its fantasy world, the biggest of which is, well, the world. Up to this point, Necesse's world was built from a limited scattering of islands. But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out. Handily, Necesse supports migrating your existing world to the new generation format, though the developers encourage players to start a new game to experience the world afresh.

By contrast, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth took the original's second act and bloated it into 50+ hours of open world RPG filler. It wasn't just the optional tower-climbing and chocobo-stealthing stuff that made Rebirth feel stretched. Even if you stuck to the critical-path story you'd have to slog through Cait Sith throwing boxes around, an overlong final dungeon, and a plot you had to move through at a crawl—sometimes literally.

Even games in big, mainstream series often sound bizarre the moment you stop to actually think about them. Resident Evil Village? Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2? Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below? Nonsense, the lot of it. I've decided to run a little test of how silly things have gotten. In this quiz, you just need to find the real game titles sprinkled among my ostentatious fake ones. Are my lies as convincing as the average Steam new releases page? Or do you see right through them to the strange-but-true reality? All of the real games have been commercially released on PC—no game jam entries, sketchy mobile releases, or anything like that. All the fake games have been commercially released… well, nowhere, because I made them up, and if you once did a student project wit…",

I took a break from it to let the updates roll in, so imagine my puzzled delight when I returned to find the latest update for this cozy museum tycoon game is a sizable crossover with horde-pummeling powerhouse Vampire Survivors . The update , which released October 16, features all sorts of new doodads to festoon your museum with, as well as the tagline \"Hell is empty… the devils are in the Digiverse.\" Sounds more like a mid-'90s cyberpunk manga than a game about funneling people towards a gift shop full of Sonic plushes, but I'm on board. You'll be able to send your unwitting gaming experts on trips to three stages from Vampire Survivors, as well as debut 10 new exhibits themed around the bullet heaven game. You can also outfit your experts with new magical weapons, as well, which may or may not prevent them from getting smoked in the latest digital expeditions.
