For many players, WoW Legion Remix is an opportunity to collect achievements and cosmetics they previously missed‚Äîor the new ones Blizzard added on top. Many of them require completing raids and dungeons that take full groups, but finding parties has proven to be a problem in the early stage of the event. Weirdly enough, players are running into completely the opposite problem you'd expect if this was the regular version of WoW: Tanks, out of all three available roles, are the overwhelming majority. That's because, as you gain more and more gear upgrades, characters dedicated to healing or pure damage-dealing aren't really needed. Unfortunately, this leaves behind all the players who haven't had the time to grind themselves into godhood. Reddit user Fjoes posted a screenshot of several groups, made up purely of tanks, waiting for a healer or damage dealer to fill the empty slots.

The two could make for a nice double feature if you want to run the gamut from high fantasy to mundane, macabre reality.

The art is as painterly and vibrant as you'd expect from a new MTG set, and the new land artworks are of pizza toppings in the shape of each color's mana symbol, so that's cute.

Nevertheless, if you've got your sights set on one of the best BF6 guns , you'll have to put in the work. Levelling up your account is one thing, but levelling up your guns is another. Below, I'll go over the max level you can reach and everything you can unlock from rank progression. What is the max level in Battlefield 6? (Image credit: EA) There's no definitive max level in Battlefield 6, letting you level into the thousands . It's theoretically infinite, though I'm sure there's a practical level 'cap' most won't want to grind past eventually. With that said, there is an endpoint in terms of progression and tangible rewards. At every level from Rank 2-50, you'll unlock guns and other gear to equip in loadouts, as well as the occasional cosmetic item. Once you reach Rank 50, you'll enter what's called mastery or advanced Ranks. Every two levels from Rank 52-100, you'll unlock new cosmetic item‚Ä¶",

However, high bloom (random bullet deviation causing shots to not land where you're actually aiming), especially on assault rifles (looking at you, M433 ), has resulted in the very strange situation where SMGs are actually more effective than ARs at medium range. One of the prime examples of this is the PW7A2 ‚Äîone of my favourite weapons so far, thanks to incredible accuracy at range on top of already strong TTK and handling. Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg, as I've just got my hands on the SCW-10 SMG.

Thankfully, this isn't as bad as most other assignments. Now, I'll admit, the SCW-10 might be the worst-looking gun at first sight, owing in large part to its very small frame, low precision stat, and measly 15 bullets in a magazine.

There's nothing more thrilling than wearing down a big health bar and barely squeezing out a victory because everyone was able to maximize their role in the fight. And that's just the boss fights. There are tons of strategies for how to work through the packs of enemies efficiently that you'll need to adapt to as the challenge increases.

Fast forward to 2019, and ASRock broadened its gaming appeal with the first of its Phantom Gaming series of motherboards. These were designed \"closely with partners to fine-tune the products, and to ensure every product can deliver outstanding gaming experience.\" Well, I can say now that one of its most recent Phantom Gaming offerings, the X870 Nova WiFi is neither fine-tuned nor delivers anything like an outstanding gaming experience. Don't get me wrong: it's not a bad motherboard. It's just that it's hampered by a number of compromises, middling performance, and a price tag that's a touch too high in today's competitive market.

For as much obvious Earthbound DNA there is in the massively popular Undertale, there's also a critical bit of Moon in there, too. After working on some RPGs at Squaresoft early in his career, Kimura satirized the genre by having you go around healing monsters with kindness instead of killing them. Fox's love for Moon helped convince Kimura to get it translated and released on Steam and Switch after two decades. (Image credit: tobyfox) Their friendship, I realized within a few minutes of talking with Kimura in Tokyo last month, also makes him careful to avoid piggybacking off of Undertale's popularity even if he'd have a good case for doing so. \"The most important thing for me when talking about Toby Fox in public is that I really like him, and because I really like him and respect him.

That number comes from SteamDB , which shows Battlefield 6 jockeying with Dota 2 for second most-played game on Steam right now behind the platform's perennial #1, Counter-Strike 2. The number has been left to simmer for a bit as I write this on a Sunday morning, but sits proudly at around 600,000 active players regardless. With a bit more oomph as the game builds up steam, it might just overtake Baldur's Gate 3's historical peak of 875,000 simultaneous players, which would put it very close to the all-time top ten . Still, it's overtaken the likes of Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and notably, any Call of Duty game on the platform, so even if it plateaus from here it is a seismic release.

At the end of this month developer Northplay is running a closed alpha playtest, and you can sign up to test its tyrannosaurs right now. In a Steam post , Northplay explained the closed alpha will comprise a \"small slice\" of Dinolords, though to my eye it looks like a sizeable slab of stegosaur steak. The closed alpha will let players get hands-on with a three-part tutorial, after which they'll be able to explore four distinct maps, two different game modes, and a \"'campaign' setup with cross-level progression.\" That's enough to give Fred Flintstone indigestion. All of this will let players experiment with Dinolords' core systems, which includes typical RTS mechanics like basebuilding and unit control, as well as the more ARPG-inspired combat.

Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D.
