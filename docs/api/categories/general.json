YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

A cybersecurity firm said the hackers initially compromised devices by sending malicious files via KakaoTalk. It’s recommended that you enable two-factor authentication on your Google account and regularly change your password. It’s not uncommon for hackers to turn your favorite apps and services against you, and it turns out cybercriminals are abusing Google Find Hub to remotely track and wipe victims’ Android phones and tablets. Security firm Genians (h/t: Bleeping Computer ) reports that North Korean state-backed hackers were compromising victims’ Android devices by using malicious files sent via the KakaoTalk chat app. The malicious scripts would then lie dormant on a user’s device, while also installing additional scripts to monitor and control the system. This way, the cybercriminals are able to harvest credentials for a variety of accounts and services.",

GameHub, which launched earlier this year as GameFusion, is an all-in-one application that allows you to play PC games on your Android device.

The credit card may offer cashback, which can be redeemed against Samsung products, including phones. In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.

It’s 2025, and the odd mandatory mention of AI features is present, but Samsung Internet isn’t an “AI browser” in the same vein as OpenAI’s Atlas or Perplexity’s Comet .
