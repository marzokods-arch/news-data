Not only that, they gave it to the person who's never known the delight of having such a snazzy sound setup before. Will she go drunk with power? Will she stop referring to herself in the third-person? Is this what happens when you listen to I Don't Care at full volume one too many times? Well friend, if that's simply not your cup of tea, I'm afraid the playlist is only going to get much, much worse from here. Once I'd got my grubby little mitts around the Creative Stage Pro sizeable box, and subsequently torn into its cardboard prison with a scavenger's frenzy, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the setup process was. Yes, this is a beefy sound device that requires a lot of wires plus its own power plug, but you're only setting up one soundbar alongside one subwoofer, and it all comes with straightforward, easy to understand instructions in the box. Also inside the box is a remote, though this runs off of 2x AAA batteries that are very much not included. The soundbar features a few rubberised control buttons too, so it's not the end of the world if pick…",

One thing I've seen repeated often in Borderlands 4's interviews is the insistence that yes, we've learned our lesson with Borderlands 3, and we're not going to give you a headache this time . We've got character motivations, stakes, and jokes not rooted in years-old memes! Which is fair enough. Borderlands 3's story ( which, warning, I will be spoiling ) was so atrocious it nearly spoiled what I otherwise found to be a great little game. I massively enjoyed zipping around as Zane with my movement speed build, and the moment-to-moment blasting was as consistent as ever. And then the story would happen and I'd start itching desperately to be shooting something again. It wasn't just the jokes, either. Borderlands 3 tripped over itself when it came to its serious moments, too. Maya's death, its insistence that Ava was the chosen one, Lilith throwing herself into a moon for some reason, any time the Calypso twins, who could've been 1,000% more interesting, were on screen—it wa…",

In a chat about Silksong and the mad scramble of devs to escape the orbit of its release date , Lowrie mentioned that there is, of course, an upcoming release even bigger, more enormous, more Brobdingnagian than Hornet and her needle: GTA 6. \"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games,\" said Lowrie, \"and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game.\" That's quintuple-A, if they start blurring together at some point for you like they do for me. \"It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands.\" Silksong might have loomed over other indie games, but GTA 6 hangs over anything you could conceivably call a videogame.

Fallen men and women lie broken within burning buildings, which stand charred and wrecked, while crop plantations lie in ashes at your feet.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. It's been a while since I abandoned my last Baldur's Gate 3 character somewhere in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, so naturally I'm going to have to start yet another new character for my next playthrough. The fourth one, I think, or maybe it's the fifth? I still haven't completed a full playthrough of Baldur's Gate, but I sure do have Act 1 down. It's more or less a checklist to me at this point, and I'm far from the only one who's displaced a few childhood memories to build a mental map of the Emerald Grove, Goblin Camp, Underdark, and the rest of BG3's opening chapter. How much of BG3's first act has been burned into your long-term memory? Try the 15 question quiz below to see how hopeless your RPG restarting habit is. Too easy? Too hard?

It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

Tucked away into the accompanying blog post for the PowerToys 0.94 update (via Windows Latest ) is news of a feature in the works that will \"automatically switch between light and dark mode based on your schedule.\" At present in Windows 11 , you can select dark mode by ducking into settings, then looking under personalisation, and then colours. You can also pick a muted 'accent' colour to highlight certain features of the Windows UI—such as sliders and hyperlink text—without harshing the more sedate vibes of dark mode. The rest of the recent 0.94 update focuses on quality of life updates, such as adding a search box into the PowerToys settings menu, plus a new gliding cursor mode that offers a little extra support for …",

I'm not playing it right now, because it is my accursed duty to write news for the hungry masses—given a lot of you are currently fighting Steam, tooth and nail. News like \"hey, did you know that Silksong has two separate speedrun achievements?\" Per… well, my achievement list, the game has the two following achievements: \"Speedrunner\", which requires you to complete the game in five hours, and \"Speed completion,\" which requires you to 100% it in 30 hours. (Image credit: Steam / Team Cherry) That's not to say Silksong's short, or anything—the current world record for Hollow Knight is a measly 30 minutes , and as my own library can attest, I've spent a good 40 hours futzing around Hallownest. When it comes to the absurd tech that the internet's massive speedrunning community is certainly cooking up in their labs? Five hours is practically nothing—basically bullet time. It's that latter number that's slightly more interesting. If we go ahead and assume that Team Cherry's played enough of the game to get a good guesstimate (a safe assumption, they made the dang thing) a fast, beelining-for-everything playthrough worthy of accolades is 30 hours.

This time, the expansion in question is the upcoming Phantasmal Flames. 'But Elie,' I hear you say, 'that set isn't out yet, you can't even pre-order it, how does one manage to scalp it already?' Through the power of cheesing the system, unfortunately. (Image credit: The Pokémon Company ) Yesterday, Phantasmal Flames products were loaded up onto the Pokémon Center, not for pre-orders, but just as a preparation for the launch. But in just under an hour, scalper groups somehow managed to trick the checkout system into selling them all the products they wanted. Leading to one group called Hidden Society purchasing around 42,000 Phantasmal Flames products. An admin for the Hidden Society Discord group sent a member-only message out yesterday (via pokebeach ) confirming that the scalpers managed to score \"over 42,000 items checked out (counting multi-count orders)\" \"If Pokémon Center wanted to pull stock earlier, they…",

With 36,000,000 users online, Steamstat.us currently lists the Steam store as operating at a \"Very slow\" capacity, occasionally ticking over to a concerned, yellow \"Bad gateway\" message. It is worth mentioning, of course, that Hollow Knight: Silksong was never up for pre-order. Anyone who wanted day-one access to the game had to turn up at 15:00 GMT on the dot and buy the dang thing. Would allowing pre-orders, rather than forcing the game's incredibly thirsty fans and legions of curious onlookers to all show up at once, have ameliorated this situation? Probably a bit. But it would have been much less funny.

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds.

The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project. But if you take it at face value, there's a good chance Valve is indeed planning some kind of console and it's going to be known as the Steam Frame.
