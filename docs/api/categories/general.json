    "body": "I sometimes wonder how Valve, which released over 20,000 new games on Steam in 2025 alone, can possibly be checking every single one of those games for potentially questionable content before they go up for sale. That's almost 400 new games per week to keep an eye on—a task that would require a whole lot of eyes. Someone at Valve does seem to be watching, though. Case in point: comedy adventure Earth Must Die from Size Five Games, which launches today. As noted on its Steam page , the game contains \"an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor,\" and that description seems to have raised at least one questioning eyebrow at Valve HQ. According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

PC Gamer's Morgan Park was there , and disgraced streamer Guy Beahm, better known to the online world as Dr Disrespect, was not—which might seem like an odd thing to say, except, well, he said he was. The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend.

He hasn't been seen since. Eva Yan, Thomas's mother, told News12 in an interview that detectives believe the boy met someone while playing Roblox online, and subsequently planned to go and meet that person in the city. She added that such behaviour was completely out of character for Thomas. Yan says family and friends are organising search parties across Long Island and the wider city nearly every day. Police add that Thomas’s last known locations were near Cherry and Rutgers streets in Lower Manhattan and later near Sands and Jay Street in Brooklyn, and ask anyone with potential information to contact them (details below).

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch. Despite pulling in nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, it's currently sitting at an incredibly low 33% 'mostly negative' reviews. If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that . I can understand why people have been so quick to judge—Highguard is an awkward hodgepodge of genres that was poorly unveiled, and a sharp departure from the developer's penchant for movement shooters.

This is, of course, because up until yesterday New Vegas had absolutely no bespoke sneaking animation for its canine companion Rex. Unlike the game's human companions, whenever the player dropped into a crouchwalk while accompanied by Rex, the daft mutt would simply… remain standing, plodding along behind you like you were on a jolly in the park and not on a stealth mission of immense importance.

According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K.

    "body": "I may have missed out on the original Minecraft era, but I'm not making that mistake a second time as Hytale accounted for most of my gameplay hours within the last two weeks. It's good stuff, albeit largely unfinished good stuff, but the updates are slowly trickling in, and I'm all about this new necromancy grimoire in the latest patch. Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments. The skeleton-summoning book builds upon the necromancy feature that sent the Hytale subreddit into a panic last week af…",

That would be videogames: MinnMax's near-11,000 Patreon members and 70,000 YouTube subscribers most often tune in for rapid-fire questions with a Ghost of Yōtei developer or a behind-the-scenes interview with a former games journalist or multi-hour discussions about a single game. But talking about games becomes increasingly difficult when your neighbors are being abducted from their homes and federal agents have executed two people in the street, with videos of the killings spreading across social media like a conflagration. \"Everybody's on edge, everybody's really freaked out. The city is scared. It's being terrorized by ICE agents, and you can feel it everywhere you go,\" Hanson said on an earlier podcast two weeks ago, titled Let's Talk About Minneapolis . \"I don't think people realize how bad it is,\" said cohost Sarah Podzorski. \"Everyone seems to think it's happening away fro…",

And I've dedicated the last three years of my life to this project and spent those years getting to know the team, which has become like a family to me.

The channel \"Elden Ring Fights\" is exactly what it says on the tin, and it recently uploaded a banger: Dark Souls' Artorias vs. the bosses of base game Elden Ring . FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars. If you have a real job and don't like watching 30-minute YouTube videos, here are the highlight battles I'd recommend skipping to: 8:22 - Maliketh the Black Blade 13:31 - Dr…",

The data in question was protected with BitLocker, which is automatically enabled on most modern Windows PCs to encrypt the PC's hard drive. Users can choose to store the keys on a separate device, or via Microsoft's cloud service (which is the default option). In the Guam case the keys had been stored on Microsoft's servers, and were provided to the authorities. \"While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide how to manage their keys,\" said Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne, adding that the company receives around 20 such requests per year.
