The U.S. rock veterans played a sold-out marathon set at UTAS Stadium in Launceston on Saturday (Jan. 24), marking their first Tasmanian performance in more than a decade and their debut concert in the state’s second-largest city. The show, which ran close to three hours, was the band’s only Australian date on the current visit. Late in the set, Grohl addressed the crowd with a major update on the band’s next chapter, confirming that Foo Fighters have recently completed work on a new record. “We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023’s But Here We Are is complete. Grohl also hinted strongly that fans won’t have to wait long to see the band back on Australian soil. “This won’t be the last time you see us,” he said. “We’ll be back here sooner than you think… and it’s before my next birthday.” Grohl’s birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia befor…",

The singer teased the plans during an interview on The Smallzy Show on Friday (Jan. 23), after host Smallzy pointed out that Tomlinson has already announced tour dates across the U.K., Europe and the U.S. running from March through July. “I think you’ve done tour dates for some parts of the world, is that right?” Smallzy asked. “Yeah, Australia dates aren’t out there yet, though,” Tomlinson replied . When Smallzy referenced a side-eye emoji Tomlinson had previously left in response to a fan asking about Australian dates, the former One Direction member leaned fully into the speculation. “I always find the question kind of funny because as long as I’ve been touring, I’ve always come to Aus. It’s inevitable,” Tomlinson said. “I love it there, I love it. So yeah, I’ll definitely, definitely be there.
