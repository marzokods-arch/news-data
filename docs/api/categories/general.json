    "body": "Spanish superstar Rosalía returned this week to Mexico City, where she attended a listening session for her new album LUX on Wednesday night (Oct. 29) with a lucky group of fans. Her visit turned into an entire culinary experience featuring popular Mexican dishes and a night of partying alongside her friends, the members of Mexican band Latin Mafia . Rosalía shared the trip with her millions of followers on TikTok Live, showing her and her friends riding in a limousine through the streets of Mexico’s capital before arriving at a branch of a famous pozole restaurant chain. There, she tasted the popular dish for the first time — a broth made with corn kernels, chicken or pork, chili and topped with lettuce. She also enjoyed some enfrijoladas , tortillas dipped in bean sauce and filled with shredded chicken.

The premiere issue wasn&#8217;t even focused on the music industry; Billboard ’s eventual trademark concentration on music, and, of course, charts, would develop over decades. The First Issue Before it became a weekly publication, and a 24/7 presence online, Billboard launched as Billboard Advertising . Its original mission? One that helps explain its name: &#8220;A monthly résumé of all that is new, bright and interesting on the boards.&#8221; (Circus promoter Jared Bell is widely credited as a pioneer of 19th century marketing through billboards, beginning in the 1830s.)
