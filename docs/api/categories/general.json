Unless you hit it with a sledgehammer. The wildest glitch in Battlefield 6. Lmao. pic.twitter.com/A0k1I32mRd October 15, 2025 In the last 24 hours, clips have started circulating of players able to gain unparalleled verticality with a kind of bug that makes you wonder, \"What was the person who discovered this even doing?\" Typically, standing on a drone in BF6 doesn't achieve much: As soon as its controller moves it, you'll slide off. But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing. The drone will start drifting downwards after ascending, but in a delightful rejection of our earthly physics, the bug's repeatab…",

While I'll admit that last bit isn't often acknowledged by historical consensus, it is the basis for Tears of Metal, an upcoming hack-and-slash roguelike with a playable demo on Steam . It's a dark fantasy Dynasty Warriors following a legion of displaced Scots—a combination I didn't know I was missing, but one I'm happy to report is sick.

Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam. That's a whole lotta genres, so in the fill-in quiz below I've given you a full 15 gosh darn minutes to type as many of them as you can. They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

Thanks to the Invasion update coming on October 21, you'll now have to defend yourself against knife-wielding Reagents. If you've spent any amount of time playing already, you've probably already encountered a character that looks exactly like one of your friends. But, upon approaching you, they pulled out a knife and started flailing it in your direction. It's not until they start running the other way that you realise that their gamer tag isn't quite spelt right, and they never responded to your desperate cries asking what they were doing. The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs. But, unless you hand-pick it yourself, you won't have to worry about constantly checking over your shoulder in case you're being betrayed, as Invasion is a standalone game mode. If you are…",

Actually, that's a relatively revealing spec as it implies this GPU will be a value play, at least in the context of megabucks AI chips. Were it aiming at top-tier AI performance, it would more likely use something along the lines of HBM or High Bandwidth Memory over a huge memory bus. Notably, there's no mention at all of Celestial, the graphics architecture that was supposed to follow Intel's current Battlemage tech , which was previously presented under the Xe3 brand and was equally absent from the Panther Lake launch , despite that chip getting Xe3 graphics. Anyway, Intel says that Crescent Island won't be out …",

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",

It simply feels like the wrong way to play those games, like one of those mods that crowbars VR support into games designed to be played on a flat screen—a novelty, but not something I'd ever use for a full playthrough. Well, imagine how scandalised I was when I learnt that not only do people prefer to play these sorts of games that way, but that contingent is sizeable enough to alter Obsidian's thinking when it comes to The Outer Worlds 2 . Chatting to Game Informer , game director Brandon Adler says a desire from fans made the studio revise its plans to stay strictly first-person. \"About halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it,\" said Adler. That puts third-person in rare company. Adler says that, for many of the ideas that devs wanted to implement, the studio stayed strikingly sober: \"You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one.'\" Obsidian did not, in fact, make the game's third-person sicko mode itself…",

Its cinematic take on World War II, and especially the Omaha Beach landing, earned it our Best Action Game of the Year award, and made it one of 2002's must-play games. The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing. Or, to put it another way, \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" as Zampella recently told GQ Magazine . It's an incredible own-goal in the history of video…",

While some Call of Duty transplants are gobsmacked by the mechanic on principle, DICE is currently investigating instances where bloom is working a little too well. As no shortage of clips shared over the weekend reveal, sometimes guns just decide to be inaccurate at extremely close range , or at the beginning of a magazine when they should still be accurate. But there's a good chance that we're talking about multiple bugs disrupting accuracy, and it's probably not all bloom's fault.

An animated series about Sam Fisher coming out of retirement for one last job Release date : October 14, 2025 Network : Netflix Director : Guillaume Dousse Cast : Liam Schreiber, Kirby, Janet Varney Link : Official site Stealth isn't the easiest thing to adapt from a game to a TV series. Playing a Splinter Cell game as Sam Fisher, we're more than happy to spend hours slinking slowly through corridors and stairwells, crouching motionless for long minutes in the dark observing enemy patrol routes, and painstakingly carrying unconscious bodies into darkened corners to secrete them. But watching someone do that in an animated series? For 20 minutes at a time? It's hard to imagine that being gripping, which is probably why the stealth sequences in Netflix's animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch don't last all that long before transitioning into straight action. There's as much gunplay, knife fighting, and car-chasing in Deathwatch as there is sneaking and slinking around—which isn't really in the spirit of the Splinter Cell games. But for a TV show, our hero being more panther than ghost isn't a bad thing, really. Written and produced by John Wick creator D…",

    "body": "Anyone old enough to remember when PCs would try to use their buzzer speaker—the one meant to give audio feedback on motherboard errors—for in-game audio will know the value of a basic pair of desktop computer speakers . Even though we no longer need to plug soundcards into our gaming machines, the ability to output music that doesn't sound like a horde of angry wasps learning to play the kazoo in a sex toy factory is important in a world where games have actual composers working on them rather than expressing themselves through a series of bleeps the programmer made up. No disrespect to Jeff Minter there. Even having a basic pair of desktop speakers can elevate your gaming over hooking up to some earbuds via Bluetooth (or, heaven forbid, using the speakers built into your monitor). And the Creative Pebble Pro is most certainly a basic set of desktop speakers. You can get cheaper ones, sure, and you can definitely get more expensive ones. You can get ones with more bass and more inputs, but these cheap speakers from computer audio specialist Creative have got you covered for most game music and sound effects, and look pretty alongside your monitor too. If you were ever lucky enoug…",

    "body": "One of Phasmophobia' s greatest successes is its lasting effect on the horror genre. Multiplayer horror has always had a foothold amongst the subgenres' finest, but after Phasmo's release five years ago, the scene has totally exploded with more horror games, both intense single-player experiences and wacky multiplayer romps. Part of this was certainly thanks to other factors, such as the pandemic keeping people inside, meaning that many were looking for new ways to hang out with friends, but it's safe to say that Phasmo's success spurred on the appetite for co-op games we've seen recently, like Lethal Company or REPO . (Image credit: Kinetic Games) You'd think that Phasmo's creator, Daniel Knight, would want to keep some of that success to himself, but that's just not the case. \"There's definitely some games out there that have taken a lot of inspiration from Phasmo,\" Knight tells me. \"But the reason why I made the game was because nothing like it existed, and I wanted to play that game. So now that there are all these other games out there, the same as Phasmo, it's just really good to see. Because at the time, there was nothing, now there's obviously quite a lot.\" Knight has said…",
