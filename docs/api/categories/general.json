    "body": "January 2026 started off with a cold, hard fact: Death is inevitable. The first major musician death to make the news this year was that of Jim McBride, the Nashville Songwriter Hall of Fame artist known for penning country hits alongside Alan Jackson; he died days into the new year on Jan. 6 at age 78. Among his most known songs that he collabed with the country star on were &#8220;Chasin’ That Neon Rainbow,” “Someday,” “That’s All I Need to Know,” “(Who Says) You Can’t Have It All” and “Chattahoochee,” with the last song peaking at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993. Days later, on Jan. 10, Colombian singer-songwriter Yeison Jiménez passed away in a plane crash that took the lives of six people. He was 34. Deadheads were stunned the same day when a statement on Bob Weir&#8217;s Instagram account announced that the Grateful Dead founding member had died at 78 after beating lung cancer, but had &#8220;succumbed to underlying lung issues.&#8221; Another unexpected death of a celebrated artist was announced before the new year was even two weeks old. Grammy-nominated musician John Forté, who is known for his work with the Fugees, was found dead at age 50 in his Massachusetts ho…",

Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

Music videos currently shrink to a small Now Playing bar, making them hard to watch outside the player screen. We don’t know how it will look if it rolls out, but YouTube made a very similar change some time ago. Spotify music videos feel so normal now that it’s easy to forget they’re still officially a beta feature. That’s a good thing, because it means some of the rough edges are still being ironed out. One of the biggest issues with them is what happens when you leave the Now Playing screen while a video is playing, and it looks like Spotify might be following YouTube’s example in working on a fix.

As promised , Samsung is officially bringing the Galaxy Z TriFold to the US, and eager customers will be able to buy it starting Friday, January 30. The pricing for the Galaxy Z TriFold with 512GB storage is set at $2,899, and it will be available through Samsung’s online and offline retail stores.

While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

    "body": "TL;DR Belkin will shut down its Wemo cloud service for smart home devices later this week. Around two dozen devices are at risk of going obsolete, but you might be eligible for a partial refund if you bought them recently. However, if your device supports Apple HomeKit or Thread, it is immune to the shutdown. The shutdown date for Belkin’s Wemo smart home app is almost upon us. On January 31, 2026, Wemo’s cloud service will be shuttered, and any devices that run on it will effectively be turned into dumb devices (if they can still function, as with light bulbs). Therefore, Belkin is sending final reminders to owners and telling them they may be eligible for refunds in certain cases. After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed. In its email to existing users, Belkin also notes that while its Wemo cloud interface is shutting down, devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit or Thread’s IoT protocol will continue to work through their respective services.",

Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

The company writes that it has received reports of unaffiliated websites selling its products online.

Now, we have obtained images showing Android 17’s increased blur effects. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority You might sometimes find yourself looking at your phone bill and wondering whether it’s finally time to ditch your big carrier for something cheaper. You wouldn’t be the only one who has this passing thought on a monthly basis. Verizon in particular tends to spark strong opinions whenever we cover it, especially as prepaid plans keep getting more competitive. After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

The N64 decomp and recomp scene has exploded in the past year, and over the weekend, the latest release was shadowdropped out of nowhere. Despite being a fan project with no involvement from Nintendo or Microsoft (which owns Rare), the Banjo-Kazooie recompilation is fully playable on PC, Linux, and Mac, and fixes and modernizes many aspects of the classic 3D platformer. Banjo: Recompiled is essentially a full remaster of the original game, improving frame rates and adding widescreen support for modern displays. It also enables the use of a second analog stick to control the camera, providing a much more modern control scheme than the C buttons on the N64 controller.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 17 is said to be shifting away from flat design toward translucent, blur-heavy visuals. Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",
