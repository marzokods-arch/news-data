Of course, using the same gear as Faker isn't going to suddenly make you too a four-times League of Legends World Champion, but at the very least if you're matching the gaming setups that the professionals use you can't use that as an excuse. You're just going to have to use them to git gud. I've picked out three of the main categories of esports, FPS (Valorant, CS2, Fornite), MOBA (League of Legends, DOTA 2), and sports (Rocket League, FC25), and picked the most popular gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, and gaming headset from what the highest proportion of professional gamers use. It is worth noting that sponsorship and platform plays a big part of this, where Logitech sponsors a lot of the MOBA pros and the PS5 is the de facto platform for something like FC25, so the DualSense is the automatic choice for the pros.

Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic‚Äîa game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece‚Äîthe pinnacle of its chosen genre?

The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year.

Benzies was one of the key leadership figures that had overseen GTA's rise from a pioneering open world romp into a global cultural phenomenon, and Barb's first big project was supposed to be Everywhere: a multiplayer RPG in a futuristic open world where, ultimately, players would be able to author their own experiences. Everywhere was hugely ambitious and backed by the staggering sums that Benzies' reputation could attract: Barb had raised ¬£233 million by 2024, and by the end of that year boasted 448 staff. But it didn't have a game it could release and, with Everywhere's ambitious scope, a decision was made at some point to shift focus to MindsEye, which had begun as an in-game experience that was part of Everywhere. MindsEye released in June this year and has been a disaster. Within weeks of the game's launch there was news of mass layoffs at Barb, the true scale of which is only now becoming clear. Earlier this month a scathing open letter was signed by 93 former Barb employees , allegin‚Ä¶",

And it would be justice for the fact she wrote a theme for Spectre that ultimately went unused in favor of Sam Smith's song, Writing's On the Wall.

The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map.

But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out.
