If you long for the simpler times back when enemies just smoked you and got it over with, you might take a shine to Classicvania and Zelda-inspired adventure game Mina the Hollower , the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games. Speaking with Knowledge, Yacht Club co-founder Sean Velasco highlighted the game's simple control setup intended to \"take something old and rejig it,\" as reported by GamesRadar . \"There are limitations, but the limitations are what provide the fun,\" Velasco told Knowledge. \"Every game has a parry now. I played that new Doom, and even Doom has Dark Souls stuff in it … We didn't want to do something with a simple dodge-roll. We try to take something old and rejig it, do something interesting with it.\" To that end, Mina's maneuverability is limited; she can jump and burrow, and the rest is \"about getting that neutral space and playing it like a Castlevania or a Bloodbor…",

    "body": "Rory Norris, Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: getting stuck into Battlefield 6, testing out weapons and all the new maps in the launch version. This week I've been: trying to unlock every weapon in Battlefield 6 before Season 1. It's been almost four years since the last Battlefield game, 2042, and nearly a decade since the last truly great one. The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map. As a series veteran, I think it's safe to say that none of these maps are particularly large, and I do hope we get more diversity going forward. That said, I'd say Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and N…",

Now, Necesse is not done, exactly, but feature-complete as far as Fair Games' main plans for it went. The 1.0 update introduces multiple significant changes to its fantasy world, the biggest of which is, well, the world. Up to this point, Necesse's world was built from a limited scattering of islands. But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out. Handily, Necesse supports migrating your existing world to the new generation format, though the developers encourage players to start a new game to experience the world afresh. Elsewhere, the 1.0 update overhauls Necesse's balance and progressio…",

By contrast, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth took the original's second act and bloated it into 50+ hours of open world RPG filler. It wasn't just the optional tower-climbing and chocobo-stealthing stuff that made Rebirth feel stretched. Even if you stuck to the critical-path story you'd have to slog through Cait Sith throwing boxes around, an overlong final dungeon, and a plot you had to move through at a crawl—sometimes literally. Screenrant recently spoke to Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, and brought up some of these complaints. \"Regarding time management in certain sections,\" he replied, \"especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary.

Real census data is used to populate cities like Chicago and Dallas with realistic commuters, and you're saddled with getting them to their jobs, homes, and so on with as little hassle as possible. Whether people even take the subway depends on a variety of factors, so it's up to you to ensure it's accessible and not prone to delays. There's a page on Subway Builder's site that gets into specifics , saying \"The US census records home and workplace locations.

When that suit was filed, the team behind the private server issued a statement: \"Turtle WoW is here to stay.\" Yesterday, October 17, they issued another: An open letter to Blizzard itself, requesting a licensing framework for fan mods and private servers. The letter, which you can find in full on the front page of the Turtle WoW website, gets into the history and arguable inevitability of fanmade mods. \"Many successful games have a modding community.

That said, The Dark Ages was the first Doom game to be fully and constantly ray-traced, making it a less obvious candidate for handheld gaming when it launched. While it ran well enough on most PC hardware and could even deliver reasonable framerates on a cheap gaming laptop, as Andy Edser noted in his PC performance analysis , the Steam Deck nonetheless struggled to meet its minimum requirements, and as such performance was underwhelming.

I saw Building Relationships at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show on Saturday. It's a funny game but, crucially, it's not just funny because you're a building. It's also funny in the same way Baby Steps is: there's something inherently comical about the moment-to-moment movement, the bonkers physics, and the sense that you're always in control but only just. When the seductive protagonist does find a date—perhaps with a charismatic windmill, or a friendly manor, or a \"himbo\" tent—the process proceeds as a mini-game. For example, as my house dined with a grand old abode, I had to put together a flat-pack table for my romantic interest to eat (because buildings eat furniture, obviously).

Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router.

The lesson here is: don't mess with Battlefield's traditional mode, or you'll be met with pitchforks. After all, people complaining about Conquest matches ending due to the time expiring and not down-to-the-wire battles of attrition weren't annoyed by the tickets; they were annoyed by the timer .

Surprisingly well, that is, compared to just not working at all or being entirely unplayable, which is what I would have expected for such an old card in most modern, good-looking games. We do, the YouTuber explains, need to make \"some pretty big visual sacrifices\" to achieve a relatively solid 60 fps. To my eyes, though, those visual sacrifices aren't ones that make the game unplayable. They essentially mean dropping the resolution down low, which will, of course, make the game look quite jagged and pixelated, but even on the lowest settings, the actual visuals, such as textures, still seem to look half-decent. The AMD Radeon RX 570 has just 4 GB of VRAM, but Battlefield 6 doesn't use more than this when it's set to the lowest settings at 1080p.
