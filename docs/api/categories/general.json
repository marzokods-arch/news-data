For its part, Warhorse is rather tired of talking about it. The studio told us last year that it was \"fed up\" of being dragged into culture wars and wanted only \"to make a cool videogame,\" but when I got the chance to chat with Martin Klíma, studio co-founder and KCD2 executive producer, about KCD2 taking PCG's 2025 GOTY award , I had to take a second to ask: did he think the controversies actually impacted the series at all, in terms of sales, reception, or developer morale? Klíma said that, really, it was difficult to tell. \"I would really, really like to know the answer to this one,\" he said. \"You can really convincingly argue both ways.

As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies. This project uses a smart array of coils in the tablet itself, making it \"compatible with most commercial pens from different vendors, offeri…",

However, there was something about the tenor of CES 2026's tidal wave of AI announcements that really got under my skin—namely, many of the exhibitors seem to have forgotten the 'consumer' part of this electronics tradeshow. CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. Now, I know it wasn't AI all the way down. There was still plenty of delightful CES weirdness in the form InWin's fresh signature chassis that looks not unlike a futuristic glass egg , as well as yet another rollable laptop concept machine from Lenovo . I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further. But, even setting aside the hours our poor Andy spent locked inside Lenovo's AI sphere of despair , a number of exhibitors at this year's CES focussed on AI. Gigabyte is among the most obvious examp…",

And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this. The first comes from IGN Poland , which said earlier this week ( Google translated ) that it first heard about this new expansion, \"from someone who has repeatedly provided us with reliable insider information,\" years ago. IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement.

However, while DF's patch notes often skew towards absurdist comedy, update 53.09 features a bugfix that's raw tragedy: \"Mothers no longer seek ghostly babies.\" Sorry, baby shoes. We found a sadder six-word story. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) For the uninitiated, properly attending to your settlement's dead is one of the many obligations the Dwarf Fortress player has to manage. When a dwarf succumbs to one of DF's countless hazards, you don't just suffer the loss of a worker and the emotional toll that's dealt to their grieving loved ones. If a dead dwarf isn't adequately entombed or memorialized, there's a chance that their restless spirit will return to haunt the fortress, further tormenting those who've outlasted them. And if your fortress has suffered a …",

But it's also iconic for the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS), which sees you using your Pip Boy to target and pop-pop body parts of various wasteland uglies. While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?'\" To hear Pely describe it, it was a right pain in the butt to get it all sorted—even camera positioning was a big challenge: \"We spent so much time basically trying to get the game to figure out where to put the camera so you could see the slow-motion playback.

Because we like to take some time each January to catch up on games that might have slipped through the cracks on previous years! Keep checking back over the next few weeks to discover more overlooked gems. There are some games that build their entire experience around one ultra-satisfying little moment. In Dogpile, it's the point when two dogs of the same type touch and, with a chirpy little bark, merge into one bigger, higher value dog. And if that new dog should happen to pop into existence already next to another dog of the same type, and start off a chain reaction of merges that jostles the whole pile around into an avalanche of yaps… oh boy, that's doggy heaven. Dogpile wisely doesn't overcomplicate that core joy. The format is simple. Each hand, you draw three dogs from your deck, and choose where to drop them into the pit. (Image credit:…",

But here we are, CES in January 2026, and Intel's new Panther Lake chip isn't just the most exciting launch. It's virtually the only launch. Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green . And AMD had nothing but respins of existing products . I suppose you could point to Qualcomm's second-gen Snapdragon X2 chips as something exciting. But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.
