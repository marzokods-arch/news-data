Or the fact that my beard is rapidly going grey, proving once and for all that I am truly a mortal man. Well, I've had a chance to check out Nvidia's new G-Sync Pulsar tech in action at CES 2026 , and now I'm afraid that all other gaming monitors look a bit... crap. It's Medusa-like tech. I've seen it, I can't unsee it, and now I'm forever changed. Okay, that's a hefty dose of overstatement. But Pulsar's refresh rate-matched backlight strobing tech makes such a difference to the way your eye perceives moving objects on a screen, looking at a regular monitor in motion now feels like a lesser experience. I was shown two demos, the first of which involved NPC characters with nametags moving quickly past my field of view in Overwatch 2 . On the left was a monitor without G-Sync Pulsar, and it looked fine. A little hard to read at full speed, but hey, motion blur is motion blur, and the fast-moving characters looked completely normal to my eyes. On the right was a Pulsar-enabled monitor.

    "body": "With memory pricing ballooning to apocalyptic amounts due to demand from the AI industry , it doesn't feel like we've had much good news in the realm of SSDs in recent weeks. Well, Phison Electronics is looking to change that with the PCIe Gen5 controller it just unveiled at CES 2026. The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too. Let's get into the numbers: according to Phison, \"E37T achieves up to 14.7 GB/s sequential reads and 13.0 GB/s sequential writes, with up to 2,000K 4 KB random IOPS.\" Bein…",

Be Quiet! is one of them, announcing new power supplies and coolers. Following on from the Dark Rock 5 , the Dark Rock 6 and Dark Rock Pro 6 have a new angular look and semi-passive modes. The Dark Rock 6 comes with six heat pipes and a single 135 mm Silent Wings fan. Meanwhile, the Pro is on a whole other level with none fewer than seven heat pipes. How about that? It also has two Silent Wings fans of unspecified size—though I'd guess from the images provided that they're also 135 mm. Both coolers offer a sleek all-black appearance, with a shroud covering the top and sides of the heatsink. That's the sorta attention to detail we've seen on other Be Quiet! air coolers in the past, although generally they have been dearer than competitors ( Arctic Freezer 36 or Thermalright Peerless Assassin) for the extra flair. A new all-in-one cooler is the star of the show, according to its creator. The Light Loop IO LCD, and yes, LCD denotes it having a screen on it. A 2.1-inch IPS display.

The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is where tech vendors like to go ape with new products, as well as showcase their regular updates and fresh models. When it comes to graphics cards, though, they tend to be all very much of the same design and look. Which is possibly why Gigabyte's designers have just a tad…unusual… with their new RTX 5090 graphics card. Specifically, it's the Aorus GeForce RTX 5090 Infinity . As GPU names go, that's actually very understated, which is the polar opposite of the card's appearance. Gigabyte isn't offering a full suite of images for the card just yet, but I don't think it's going to look any better from a different angle. And even if it did, you're never really going to see those angles once it's installed inside your gaming PC.

Well, chalk up another win for the Dootster.

Combine that with his previous no-hit wins in Dark Souls 2 and 3 (and Elden Ring, by the by) and you've got the full combo: a hitless, sax-based run of the entire Souls trilogy, a feat presumably unparalleled through all human history. To be fair, Gwyn went down like a chump. Dr Doot was using a sorcery build that made total mincemeat of the old guy. Rather than a nailbiter finish, it was more of a one-punch (one-doot) man situation. Still, our hero was rightly pleased with his achievement. \"The World's First Sax-Controlled Dark Souls No-Hit Run has been DOOTED!\" wrote Dr Doot in a post on X. \"I just beat Dark Souls without getting hit by a single ene…",
