    "body": "Sharon Osbourne is pushing back against an attempt to release early Black Sabbath recordings, publicly challenging former band manager Jim Simpson after he issued a press release claiming legal ownership of the tapes. The dispute, which escalated over the weekend, comes months after the death of her husband , founding Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne. Simpson, who managed the group in their earliest days, announced on Nov. 14 that he intends to release a collection of 1969 demos recorded before the band adopted the Black Sabbath name. The material, titled Earth: The Legendary Lost Tapes , was initially expected for release in July. The project has yet to materialize, but Simpson maintains he has the right to distribute the recordings. Sharon publicly disputed those claims in a detailed Instagram post shared on Saturday (Nov. 15). Her post included screenshots of a July 2 email she says she sent to Simpson, warning him against moving forward without the band’s approval. “As you know, the Band do not want these tapes released, not least as they haven’t heard them despite you saying you would provide copies long ago,” she wrote. “You know that, as a band, Black Sabbath don’t take…",

The explosive and unforgettable performance turned into a celebration filled with hits from Dave Grohl&#8217;s rock band&#8217;s 30-year career. On day one, the musical feast — which is celebrating its 15th edition — was filled with 1990s nostalgia but also showcased new talents from genres like indie, soul, electro-pop, and folk. It drew over 78,000 attendees (according to promoter Ocesa) who enjoyed performances by Queens of the Stone Age, Franz Ferdinand, Garbage, Kaiser Chiefs, 4 Non Blondes, Jet, Lucy Dacus, Bad Bad Hats, Debby Friday, and other acts. The audience, demanding yet warm, kept the energy and good vibes throughout the day, which stretched into the early hours of Saturday at the Curva 4, the Formula 1 venue in Mexico City.
