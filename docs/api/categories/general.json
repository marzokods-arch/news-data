If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work. Yakuza 0 offered a stunning, immersive vision of t…",

Both Hollow Knights are deliciously old school in how they make you work for your double jump, withholding it until deep into the game.

Outward 2 isn't a game where they'll wait in an orderly circle and attack one by one; they just take advantage of their numbers if they have them.

If you've seen the trailer for Join Us, the co-op (or singleplayer) open world survival sandbox Wolf Haus Games revealed today at the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, you probably have a few questions. I sure did after watching events in the trailer escalate from typical survival activities like farming and base-building to visions far more perplexing, like a tie-dyed bus with multiple laser-sighted heavy machine guns on the roof and a towering squid monster invading our planet from dimensions unknown. There was also a man riding a pig. You don't see that every day. I couldn't just walk away from a trailer like that, so I talked to Joe Dietsch, co-founder and CEO of developer Wolf Haus Games, to get a few more details about Join Us. According to Dietsch, in Join Us you're sent by an \"omnipresent cult leader\" into a rural area of the country, and \"it's your job to essentially start a new franchise there. You can kind of think of it like you're franchising a Burger King. There's the HQ, but you're being sent out to start your own version of this cult in a new environment.\" Once the…",

Of course, you don't play as the cult's true head honcho in Join Us; you're a franchise owner of sorts, building a personalized wing of a much larger doomsday cult in the rural United States. You'll build a remote compound, conceal yourself from local scrutiny, and recruit the psychologically vulnerable who you can detect with target-highlighting \"leader vision.\" It's like Batman's detective sight from the Arkham games, but for emotional manipulation.

As shown in the trailer, you can hit record and you'll see afterimages remain behind your little guy, capturing their positions as you move them around. You can then replay that movement, allowing the protagonist to, in the first example, cross a large gap by first recording themselves walk the length of the gap on a flat surface. But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world. It seems something like a more tactical version of Super Meat Boy or Celeste (perhaps with less ragequitting).

With over 50 weapons and some truly absurd moves, this Asian folklore-inspired fantasy RPG has a lot of potential. You can watch the PC Gaming Show trailer above. Rather than traditional RPG leveling, in First Guardian \"runes, items, and crafting are used to strengthen your character,\" which could make it easier to swap between builds than it normally is in a soulslike. I just can't wait to figure out what set of gear I need to pull off the sick dashes and somersault dagger attack we see in the trailer. There's no stamina, so you're free to go on offense as much as you'd like, but for those who prefer a less acrobatic combat style, it seems First Guardian has you covered on that front, too.

Farmbotic is a little like a 3D Stardew Valley, offering a cute, easy-going farming and gathering experience, complete with enemies to slay in mines and dungeons. The twist is that it also throws in co-op and some mechanical elements à la Satisfactory. As you can see in the trailer, there are cute robots that will work the land with you, and also machines you can build and pipes you can connect to help you keep up with all the labor that goes into maintaining a proper farm. It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears. Another feature that's just been announced is that Farmbotic will be launching with crossplay, so you won't need to disown any friends who choose to get it on PS5 or Xbox.

    "body": "I didn't think I'd see a singing axolotl today, but that's the beauty of videogames: there's always something unexpected to lift your mood. The trailer for Billie Bust Up, which appeared at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, shows off the music and platforming in the upcoming animal adventure. You play as Billie, a bunny with magical abilities. Guided by Aristotle, the singing axolotl, you'll master different powers. Billie can fly on a broomstick just like a witch, and can use an umbrella to glide gracefully like Mary Poppins. But that's not all, she can run along walls as though she's the Prince of Persia, and uses an assortment of gadgets to get through each level, like bombs, swords, and some sort of projectile launcher—it looks like the umbrella refashioned to shoot gusts of compressed air. There's still more. Billie can also turn invisible and slide around on water by turning it to ice right as she steps on it. I'm excited to see what kind of platforming challenges will be on offer. Hopefully there will be some where you have to combine multiple movement methods. Now, I don't know about you, but I often find platforming games can have rather dull boss fights that amount to…",

The swirling snow and howling wind rushing through Moominvalley makes me want to curl up with a blanket and a hot cup of tea. From the developers of Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, this spiritual successor has you playing as Moomintroll himself (for the uninitiated, these are creatures of Finnish storybook origins ). He's woken up early from his winter hibernation, and while looking for someone to help him summon spring, he instead stumbles upon characters that he can lend a helping hand to. One of these is a timid squirrel that Moomintroll finds scurrying about in the attic. As we see during the trailer above, he runs out into the frosty world, following the squirrel's tracks and telling them it's okay to stay inside where it's nice and warm. I love the art style—it looks like you're playing through an old Disney movie like 101 Dalmatians or Bambi. Moomintroll has to shovel snow to clear his path, hide behind boulders to stop the wind blowing him backwards on the ice, and throw snowballs at some scary eyes hiding in the trees and fright…",

As seen in the trailer, Minos plays like a tower defence game. You control the route through the maze and set traps to stop the Greek adventurers from getting to the center of your home. It's a lot like Orcs Must Die, only from a top-down perspective. You'll use spikes, ballistas, and even boulders to dispatch the raiders who dare to disturb you. You can lure all your foes into one long corridor and then use linked traps to kick off a chain reaction that finishes them all off in one fell swoop. Or, you can use rotating passages to split them up and watch them get picked off one by one. You don't have to just stand by and watch your mechanical horrors have all the fun, either: You can get stuck in and fight the stragglers. As you play you'll uncover more of his …",

Joel Fry leads the project as Vvalak Lizardtongue, a very different character to the ones he played in Game of Thrones and ancient Rome sitcom Plebs. He's got a nursing bot called Milky, which we don't need to get into right now, and his father is a monarch who doesn't want to bequeath him his rightful inheritance of the Tyrythian kingdom—a common issue among even the regular folk on this side of the pond. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, a robotic Terranoid invasion has killed the king and taken over. So, Vvalak decides to go and take over Earth as revenge. What did we do to deserve this fate? Guess you'll have to play to find out. Leading the Terranoids is videogame royalty Ben Starr, who's been in everything from Final Fantasy to Hades 2 to Dead Take.
