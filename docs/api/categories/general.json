The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

Google is also testing new toggle for Live caption and a new Search Live shortcut in the AI Mode. Google is not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring that people not only rely on its AI products but also depend on them in the same way they depend on Search. That is why Google has been pushing Search features like AI Mode and Search Live parallel to Gemini and Gemini Live, offering comparable functionality with and without the benefit of results from Google Search. As you might have guessed, Search Live lets you obtain search results that are fine-tuned in real-time while interacting with it using voice or video. While the feature is still relatively new , Google is gradually adding features to make it useful to a broader set of users.

However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap.

Users can no longer buy or rent Disney content from YouTube, Google Play, or Google TV as the negotiations continue. Google and Disney are amid a tense content rights battle that saw 21 channels disappear from YouTube TV last week. Disney is using its strong content portfolio, which includes ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic, as leverage in the negotiations. Now, it appears Disney is pulling its owned media from all of Google’s digital storefronts, not just YouTube TV’s live television service. Movies and TV shows owned by Disney or its subsidiaries are no longer available for purchase or to rent on Google Play, YouTube, or Google TV , as spotted by 9to5Google . Users will only be able to watch Disney-owned content on those platforms if they previously purchased them or have an active Disney Plus subscription.",

So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025.

It appears that the AYANEO Phone will feature a dual-camera setup at the back and shoulder buttons. Gaming handheld maker AYANEO has begun teasing its first smartphone. The company posted the above teaser video of the AYANEO Phone on YouTube over the weekend, calling it “a mobile phone truly made for gamers” with the “soul of a gaming handheld.” While the brief video doesn’t show us much of the phone, we do get a glimpse of it from the back. The dual camera setup stands out most clearly in the image (we’ve increased the brightness for a better look below), but upon closer inspection, it appears that the AYANEO Phone could feature shoulder buttons for horizontal gameplay.",

Although we strongly recommend buying the Pixel Watch 4, it’s worth reminding that it isn’t your only option if you’re currently smartwatch shopping. In fact, there are still a lot of other great watches you should consider.",

    "body": "Recently, I reported that AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon had all released their Q3 2025 financial results. Verizon’s rivals are doing well, but Big Red finds itself in a much less rosy position. While it did manage to add more than 40,000 new subscribers this quarter, those gains came entirely from its prepaid and business divisions. Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

The event for the original Pixel in October 2016 is still vivid in my mind — I’d never been as excited for a phone as I was in that moment, and I haven’t felt that excitement since, either. As enamored by the Pixel as I was, I stopped using Pixels for over six years, and with good reason. The Pixel 10 Pro , though, is the phone I’ve been waiting for Google to make. What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",
