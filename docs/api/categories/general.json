According to police, while Lauren-Shriner was not involved in the hit-and-run incident, she allegedly fired a weapon at an officer while in a backyard after officials said she repeatedly ignored their commands to drop her gun. Lauren-Shriner was charged with two felony counts in the incident and pled not guilty on May 13 to charges of discharging a firearm with gross negligence and assault with a semiautomatic firearm; those charges were less severe than the initial charges the author faced when she was booked on suspicion of attempted murder followin…",

In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is fixing the no-context problem in phone calls by adding an urgent-call indicator to the Phone app. The new “Call Reason” feature lets you flag a call as urgent so the recipient knows it matters before picking up. It only works with your saved contacts for now. Phone calls always show up with zero context, so most people just ignore them. Whether you’re busy or out with friends, it’s easy to assume it can wait. The problem is that real emergencies — like your car stalling or getting locked out of your house — end up treated the same way. You can’t tell what matters until it’s too late. Google is finally tackling this issue with a new feature for the Phone by Google app . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The image from Android Headlines reveals a triple-camera setup, an extra side button, and a grippy-looking back, but no view of the front display. Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",

These issues are expected to be patched with device-specific security updates dated December 05. The list includes a few critical vulnerabilities in the Android Framework and at the system level. Google has just released the Android Security Bulletin for December 2025, with a roster of all vulnerabilities that affect Android devices. Unlike the frequent Pixel (or manufacturer-specific) security updates , this bulletin lists all potential vulnerabilities that impact Android devices. These vulnerabilities, affecting Android 13 or later, will be patched in the Android security update dated December 05, 2025, and delivered to your devices when the manufacturer releases the security update .",

Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it.
