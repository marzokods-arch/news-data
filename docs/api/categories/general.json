Bridges and Ports was originally expected to launch in mid-2024, a few months after the release of the Beach Properties asset pack earlier that year. But Beach Properties was such a mess that Paradox eventually apologized for the whole thing and just gave it to everyone for free, and ultimately delayed the expansion into the second quarter of 2025 so it could focus on the main game, which was also a mess. Then it delayed Bridges and Ports again, to near the end of 2025 , because everything was a mess. But apparently now that's all been sorted, at least enough that the expansion can be unleashed on the public. The Bridges and Ports expansion will add 20 new drawbridges and lift bridges, customizable ports, a new Ferry Transport System, \"expanded maritime industries\"—fishing, offshore oil rigs, that sort of thing—and three new maps, more than 100 assets, and new achievements.

There's also 'hardware' XP boosters, which are slightly less obvious, but these will double your progression with weapons, vehicles, and the like. With how long it can take to level up gear, hardware boosters are just as important as your regular career XP boosts. Now, you'll get a handful of XP boosts from pre-ordering Battlefield 6, since this gives you the Tombstone Pack, which includes the Gravedigger skin, Hatchet weapon package, and a few other bits and bobs. You can earn a few from assignments, but otherwise, I'm assuming these will be precious commodities bought from the shop, or potentially from battle passes and events.

Generally, IDC reckons it's going to be a very strong year, largely \"fuelled by the Windows 11 transition\", but that \"the North American market continues to be impacted by the US import tariffs shock and by macroeconomic uncertainties.\" IDC also says Asia's success \"was driven largely by Japan’s hardware refresh linked to Windows 10 end-of-support and the GIGA education project,\" but doesn't elaborate on EMEA's equally big uptick. Still, IDC is positive about the near future for the PC. \"The demand for newer PCs ready for Windows 11 is likely to push well into 2026,” the research outfit predicts.

Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 is impressive. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year. Place your palm on the pavement, and you can feel the low rumble of a hobby yearning for the return of what we loved 15 years ago: the spectacle of scale , the unserious chaos of vehicular warfare, red grunts vs. blue grunts, the permission to make your own rules , and an environment where the guy obsessed with metas is having the least fun.

Why, to design a character for The Elder Scrolls 6 , of course! That's per the UESP itself, posting yesterday on social media . \"We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls 6\", said the UESP's official social media accounts. \"Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store.\" One leading UESP-er posted that they'd even gotten a tete-a-tete with Todd Howard himself.

While Blue Protocol: Star Resonance doesn't have a character gacha in the same way that Genshin Impact does, it features a costume gacha instead. For this, you'll need Meowlux Wish Coins, which you'll purchase with Rose Orbs (the game's main premium currency) and what I expect will be the most desirable code currency. While you'll unlock the ability to redeem codes almost immediately, you'll have to progress a teensy bit further until you do the Thunder Demon Smackdown (essentially combat training) in the Seabreeze Festival to unlock the gacha. After that, you'll be able to access the \"Wish\" section in the menu. Blue Protocol: Star Resonance codes There are no Star Resonance codes currently.

Mahjong? That's a roguelike . Minesweeper? It's a roguelike. Those weird coin pusher machines that are for some reason present in every English seaside town? You better believe they're roguelikes . In that company, a slot machine roguelike seems almost obvious, though CloverPit certainly injects the idea with plenty of personality. Rather than a casino, you're sat in what appears to be some sort of prison cell (maybe in Hell?), with crispy, low-poly graphics selling the grungy feel perfectly. (Image credit: Panik Arcade) Like Balatro, the game is based around ever-increasing antes, here called deadlines. You get three rounds to try and earn enough money to hit the target, by playing spins on the slot machine. Succeed, and you move on to a new, higher deadline.

While it's not the Celestial graphics architecture we're hoping for in the desktop graphics card market, the beefy little iGPU should be ideal for handheld gaming. The best way to view Xe3 is to think of it as being an all-around polish and spruce up of Xe2, but one which also lays the foundation for Intel's next generation of Arc graphics processors. This is possibly why Intel settled on using the product name of 'Arc B-series' for the new iGPU, rather than giving it an entirely new name, even though the GPU architecture itself is new. I chatted to a few of Intel's senior staff at the Technology Tour event about the nomenclature, and nobody had any better explanation for using B-series as the name, so that's what I'm sticking with.

The Gboard Dial Version is a keyboard that eschews clicky-clacky keys for the burbling whir of nine rotary mechanisms instead (via The Verge ). For those unfamiliar with how this is supposed to work, rather than depressing a key, you jam your finger in the hole above the corresponding character you wish to type, drag the rotary wheel around as far as you can, and then release. There you go, you've 'typed' a single alphanumeric character—now on to the next one. It's a decidedly drawn-out process that would stop my hot takes long before they threaten to boil over, that's for sure. Oh, did I mention this concept keyboard comes with a stand that looks like an old-timey cradle for a landline phone?

Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit). Both feature damn near close enough the same form factor, and both are targeting the same budget-centric audience as well, and come with remarkably similar hardware underneath. On…",

    "summary": "Two months after Roblox was sued by Louisiana, the state of Kentucky has jumped in.",
    "body": "The US state of Kentucky has filed a lawsuit against Roblox , which Kentucky attorney general Russell Coleman says \"has become a playground for predators who seek to harm our children.\" Roblox has denied the allegations, telling PC Gamer that it \"has taken an industry-leading stance on age-based communication\" and rolled out more than 100 safety features on the platform in 2025 alone. The complaint alleges that Roblox Corporation \"repeatedly assure[s] parents and the public that Roblox is safe for its user base of minors,\" but that it is in fact \"a hunting ground for child predators,\" who are able to operate with near impunity because of company's refusal to implement \"basic safety controls\" or even accurately inform users and parents of the dangers on the platform. \"These dangers are not trivial,\" the complaint states. \"They range from child predators acting along to international organizations—lined with terrorist groups—that are dedicated to child sexual exploitation and self-harm.\" \"Our children are not safe on Roblox,\" Coleman said in a press release . \"Predators and criminals aren't just lurking in the platform's shadows; they've been allowed to commit their crimes out in th…",

    "body": "Before you begin your afterlife in Seattle, one of the first choices you'll make in Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is which one of the Bloodlines 2 clans your protagonist Phyre comes from. As factions in RPGs often work, each vampire clan has a very different personality and goal and which one you choose will change your combat style and how other vamps treat you in conversations. There's a whole backlog of lore from the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop RPG including even more clans, sects, and other vampire hierarchy minutia, but I'll focus on what you need to know to choose which lunch table you're doing to sit at in Bloodlines 2 including combat style, abilities, and clan persona. The six playable clans in Bloodlines 2 are: Banu Haqim : the hunters and lawbringers Brujah : the rebellious brawlers Lasombra : the shadowy killers Toreador : the graceful seducers Tremere : the scholarly warlocks Ventrue : the aristocratic tyrants What does your clan choice change in Bloodlines 2? Abilities : You can unlock abilities from other clans, but they may cost more Ability Points if the Discipline they're from isn't one that your vamp's specializes in. Dialogue : You'll have different…",

Eclipsium is a game about cutting an enormous hole in your hand that you can peer through to see secret pathways. Eclipsium is a game about transitioning from great heights to profound depths with little logic in between. I don't actually know what Eclipsium is about. I like it a lot. Eclipsium is a first-person horror game with light puzzle elements brought to you by the same publisher behind No, I'm Not a Human , and the vibes are… somewhat comparable. Eclipsium is psychedelic where NINAH is eerie, but the sense that the world you inhabit is fundamentally wrong in some indefinable way is very much there. You wake up in hospital. Who you are is not explained, and nor is what you look like. All you are is a hand—sometimes a pair of hands—extended constantly forwards to grip, grope, and move the world. You find some scissors, you take the scissors to a door that seems to have been overcome by the strange tendrils from Deadly Premonition, and click. Your character then cuts out their own tongue and uses it to convince the door to open, somehow. Also,…",
