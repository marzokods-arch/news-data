Even at a young, tender age, I admired the rarity of a game that celebrated the simple act of observing creatures in their natural habitat instead of attacking them on sight. I'm all for fighting fake creatures, of course—I wouldn't have spent a decade scrapping lizards for their parts in Monster Hunter otherwise. But sometimes it's just nice to look. Pokémon Snap did have a problem, however: Professor Oak thought it was fine to pay with exposure. No matter how many valuable shots of Pikachu I sent him, it didn't put any cash in my pocket that I might have spent on cool hats or shirts. Thankfully, there's finally a game willing to properly reward my talents in wildlight photography: Flock Around, a multiplayer photography game that brings friendslop a Peak-like experience to birdwatching. (Image credit: Secret Plan Games) After firing up the Flock Around demo on Steam and customizing my genre-standard colorful beanshaped avatar, I soon learned something about birds: They're harder to photograph than Pokémon.

Despite his weirdly perky demeanor, Tomo is pretty down about it, and helping him out rewards you with a hefty chunk of XP and a new title. The overlap with other quests makes it a long one, but once you know where to find Tomo's lost cat in The Forge , it's pretty straightforward. Where is Tomo's lost cat in The Forge? You can find Tomo's lost cat in the Goblin Cave , but it's locked behind the Goblin King quests in the Forgotten Kingdom. If you've already completed his five tasks, then you should be able to unlock the door in an alcove to the right of the king and enter the cave. After entering the Goblin Cave, cross the bridge and pass through the waterfall. You'll enter a stony nook that looks empty, but you should be able to pass through the back wall by running against it. It's just an illusion, and Tomo's lost cat is waiting for you in the hidden passage. The sped-up video above should guide you to the exact location. I…",

Never again will you need to burden yourself with pressing buttons once you get this build going as it's powerful enough to do everything in the game. Nobody has decided on an official name for it because it utilizes a bunch of different skills, but it's technically an \"auradin\" build like the ones you'd see during the days of Diablo 2. However, I propose that we start calling it the aura farmer build because the engine running everything is a holy aura that burns nearby monsters when you have a unique pair of gloves on. What's better than a single holy aura? 11 holy auras, obviously. In addition to surrounding your character, you can summon a pack of wolves and an ally mercenary who will inherit the aura too. Now, you have a whole team of aura farmers that leave a trail of ash in their wake. Outside of pushing into the high tiers of Diablo 4's hardest dungeons, this build only requires you to walk into enemies.

I use the inverted commas because, cute and cool as it was, the question of whether the rats were really playing Doom in any meaningful way, or just running on a ball for some delicious sugar water, was not conclusively answered. The project leader Viktor Tóth said at the time he wasn't happy with how they'd implemented the shooting response, and four years later the team is back with a new setup that significantly expands what the rats can do ( first spotted by Tom's Hardware ). And this time, the rodents are rocking a trigger mechanism. The first version had the rats suspended in a harness over a ball that rotated when they moved, with that movement mapped to a simplified version of a Doom corridor with an imp at the end. When the rat did the right things, it would get a reward in the form of sweetened water. The limitations meant that it was a bit of a stretch to say the rats were playing Doom, but as Tóth said you could make a decent argument they were \"kinda\" playing Doom.

Light of Motiram store pages have been taken down, and Sony and Tencent have each agreed to cover their own legal fees. “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,\" Tencent Americas head of communication Sean Durkin confirmed in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"SIE and Tencent look forward to working together in the future.” Light of Motiram's more-than-passing similarity to Sony's Horizon games, Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, were immediately apparent when the game was revealed in 2024 .

Locations over loquaciousness. Its best stories are typically buried under five feet of rubble, and dug out with archeological care through terminals and holotapes. Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America. Either way, they stick in the head like a Bing Crosby number played on a tinny radio.

Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

There's some real Between Two Ferns energy to the fake show, with the Snake Oil Salesman asking inappropriate or insulting questions: in one episode, he asks Ella Purnell how much money she makes, and repeatedly badgers her about what it's like being on Stranger Things, a show she does not appear on.

However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",
