Despite the passage of time, some of the same aesthetics are at work at the station in 2025 that were there when it started in 1925, according to current WSM GM/content director Eric Marcum , including a focus on hiring from within and a dedication to its technological history.

Pausini has announced plans to record not one, but two follow-ups: Yo Canto 2 will be entirely in Spanish, featuring covers of beloved songs originally written and performed by Latin American and Spanish artists, while Io Canto 2 will focus on a repertoire originally recorded in Italian, her native language. When Pausini kicks off her world tour in 2026, she’ll sing in Spanish for audiences in Spain and Latin America, and in Italian in other European countries. “I’m essentially making two albums in one, with more than 40 songs,” Pausini explained during a conversation with Billboard from a studio in Rome. “It’s the first time I’ve done the same concept for two albums, but with two completely different sets of repertoire.” There’s one tangible bridge between the two albums, though: first single “Mi historia entre tus dedos” (or “La Mia Storia Tra le Dita”), which …",

You guys are so talented and it’s been an honour to share the stage with you.” Earlier this year , the ensemble scored its second No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart as HOT debuted atop the tally. That feat marked LE SSERAFIM’s fifth top 10 in total for the group, which previously reached No. 1 with its last chart entry, 2024’s Crazy . A sixth top 10 might not be far off.

Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles.

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

Spotify and YouTube Music are reasonably competitive in their features , with each service having some nice extras. Spotify Connect is a lifesaver if you have multiple devices, whereas YouTube Music being bundled in YouTube Premium works out in its favor. Both services have been trying to convert more of their free users into becoming paid customers, and now it seems YouTube Music is borrowing a leaf out of Spotify’s book by paywalling the lyrics feature.

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS.

Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

    "summary": "A leak suggests the phone will have a slimmer body, but its chunky bump may negate it.",
    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A leak claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera bump measures 4.5mm, a little over 2mm more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s said that Samsung is sticking with a 1/2.52″ telephoto sensor at 50MP. The leak also claims that the phone weighs 217g. Recent Galaxy S26 leaks have hinted at Samsung bringing back the camera bump next year. And it’s not just the Galaxy S26 Edge that’s expected to have a bump; it appears this will be the case for the entire series. So if these phones are going to have a camera bump, just how large is that protrusion going to be? A new leak may give us an answer for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Well-known tipster Ice Universe has shared some new information about the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This leak touches on the thickness of the camera bump, as well as the size of the telephoto sensor and the phone’s weight.",

It’s a “complete ground-up rewrite” of the emulator, with significant changes and improvements. Highlights include an overhaul of the Vulkan rendering pipeline and early FSR2 support. Nintendo Switch emulation had a rough one in 2024, but this year is shaping up to offer some huge leaps forward.

This is a major update for the Yuzu fork, with lead developer Zephyron claiming it’s a “complete ground-up rewrite.” The most significant change here is an overhauled Vulkan rendering pipeline, as well as a complete rewrite of several other core emulation components.",
