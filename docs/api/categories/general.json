Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back.

It replaces the older option for downloading images before sharing with the option to share pictures with public links. Whether that improves sharing or causes more friction is a matter of debate. Ever since its launch, Google’s Nano Banana has stirred up numerous viral trends for AI-generated images. And unless you’re at odds with AI and uphold that it cannot replace true art, you’re likely to have participated in some of these trends yourself. To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place. And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana. It differs from the current method, where you must either download the image first, which clutters your phone’s storage, or share it as a file by long-pressing and then tapping the Share button.

In this short guide, we explain US Mobile carrier switching and how it works, as well as whether it’s as good as it sounds on paper, and who it’s best suited for. Can you switch between the networks, or do you have to pick just one? If you’ve dealt with US Mobile in the past, you might be under the assumption that you have to pick just one network and stick with it, as that was somewhat true in the past, but thankfully not anymore. US Mobile does offer the ability to switch between carriers. In fact, there are two different methods available.",

Unlike the previously reported slimming that Pro was slated to undergo, the vanilla Galaxy S26 will have dimensions comparable to the Galaxy S25. This might allow for better thermal performance, camera improvements, or improved battery life. The Galaxy S26 isn’t expected to launch until February, but leaks have continued to flow in at a steady pace. Earlier today, the Galaxy S26 Plus leaked in its iPhone 17 Pro-esque orange hue. Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",

In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.
