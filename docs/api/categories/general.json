This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

The developer is working on a new version of the app with a new digital signature, but this will be a separate app rather than an update. SmartTube is arguably the most popular alternative to the YouTube app on Android TV , offering a variety of handy features and options. In fact, I prefer this app to the official YouTube client on TVs. Unfortunately, it looks like Google has disabled the app on Android TV. Android TV owners reported this week that Google Play Protect has disabled SmartTube on their devices. Devices affected by this problem include the NVIDIA Shield TV, Walmart Onn boxes , Sony and TCL TVs, and more. It also looks like Amazon’s Fire OS-based devices have blocked the third-party YouTube app. I can indeed confirm that the app has been disabled on my Shield TV tube and disappeared from my home screen and app drawer.",

OnePlus plans to share more details about the OnePlus 15R in mid-December. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is Qualcomm’s highest-end mobile SoC, driving recent Android flagships like the OnePlus 15 . But all that power comes with increased costs — and worse thermal performance . Now, though, OnePlus has confirmed that another of its upcoming devices will debut a new Qualcomm chipset that better balances performance and trade-offs. OnePlus has shared that its OnePlus 15R, its “ultimate value flagship device,” will be the first phone released worldwide to feature the (non-Elite) Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. OnePlus says it worked with Qualcomm to design the 8 Gen 5 in a collaborative project that started in 2023.",

We’ve been tracking information gleaned from One UI 8.5 leaks going back months now, but the manufacturer has yet to get the ball rolling on a public beta.

The newly spotted color palettes enhance contrast and make the widget easier to use. The icons for mic, Lens, and AI mode also appear bigger. The November Pixel Drop arrived recently, replete with several visual upgrades for both new and old Pixel devices. Around the same time, Google also released the latest edition of Android 16’s QPR2 beta , though primarily focusing on under-the-hood improvements. With the stable QPR2 update expected in the coming weeks, we’re learning about a slight visual upgrade it brings, adding a splash of vivid colors to the homescreen on Pixel devices. The persistent Google search bar, part of the Pixel launcher, may be getting radiant colors that better match your wallpaper, as 9to5Google notes. With this change, we could see new colors take over and replace older ones, as seen with Android 16’s QPR1 stable release.",

Users are not very happy with the change and are turning to third-party extensions to restore the UI to its original state. YouTube has made yet another unpopular UI tweak, which users say serves no purpose. The platform has quietly flipped the positions of the “Subscriptions” tab and the “You” section, disrupting years of muscle memory. The old layout placed “Subscriptions” below the “You” section. Now “You” is tucked under “Subscriptions” in the sidebar.",

As a consequence of that, Disney’s Movies Anywhere service stopped syncing with YouTube and Google purchases. While it’s not restored just yet, Movies Anywhere now shares that it’s working to get that functionality back again. When massive corporations like Google and Disney butt heads with each other, the reverberations can continue for a lot longer than you might expect. Back at the end of October, after the two failed to reach a new deal, Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV . That was the outcome everyone expected, but then things started going further: First we saw the Google Play Store and Google TV drop sales of Disney titles . And then Disney’s Movies Anywhere service stopped syncing with Google Play and YouTube purchases. After a couple weeks, the companies worked things out , but there’s still a little mess left to clean up. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
