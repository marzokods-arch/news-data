The thorny legal question will be decided at a trial that began this week in London’s High Court. Court proceedings kicked off on Tuesday (Dec. 9) in long-running litigation between Hendrix’s estate and Sony Music on one side and the heirs of Hendrix’s former bandmates in The Jimi Hendrix Experience — namely bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell — on the other.

In a holiday gift pack, the company teases its CES event with a notebook featuring “fold” language. A notecard further teases “new perspectives,” which could hint at a horizontally oriented foldable. Foldable smartphones may all rely on the same basic flexible-display trick, but how manufacturers go about designing them still varies wildly — and things are only getting more complicated as we move further into the dual-fold era with devices like the (incredibly poorly named) Galaxy Z TriFold . So far, Motorola has only produced foldables of the same vertically unfolding variety, but a potential teaser might just hint at a new direction — literally.

Across all genres – from hip-hop, R&amp;B, country, pop and heavy metal to Broadway-style revivals and a show-choir showcase – there’s plenty of merrymaking cheer to go round. Destiny’s Child, Love Actually star Olivia Olson, Sufjan Stevens, Twisted Sister, Josh Groban, Faith Hill, the Glee cast, Michael Bublé, She &amp; Him, Justin Bieber, Kelly Clarkson, Kylie Minogue, Kacey Musgraves, Pentatonix, John Legend, Lea Michele, Cynthia Erivo, Alicia Keys and even the Kelce brothers all make the cut here.

    "body": "TL;DR Homey Pro (2026) has arrived, and it brings the same hardware as the older model but with one key upgrade. The RAM on the Homey Pro has been updated from 2GB to 4GB, now allowing it to run even more apps and workflows. The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade. Homey’s updated hub to rule all your smart home devices comes with 4GB of RAM, twice as much as the older model. Homey’s creator Athom says doub…",

These limited edition glasses borrow their hardware from VITURE’s recently launched Lumo Pro glasses. VITURE has also announced a new dock that extends compatibility to Nintendo Switch 2. Earlier this week, Google showed us a glimpse of what Android XR could look like without bulky glasses covering up a part of your face. These will be light-use glasses that complement, rather than replace, standalone headsets such as the Galaxy XR. In the meantime, tethered glasses that serve as extended displays for devices such as handheld gaming devices, laptops, or iPads are increasingly popular. VITURE is already flourishing in this segment, with more than 50% of the market share in the US. And today, it is bringing a (sort of) new product, marking its fondness for gamers. VITURE has announced a special edition of its Luma XR glasses to mark the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077’s release. These new edition glasses, created as part of an official collaboration with CD PROJEKT RED, appear to be based on the Luma Pro, which was only announced in July this year along…",

It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

When you click edit, you’ll have two options: Edit with Google Photos or download the RAW file. Choosing to edit with Photos will convert the photo into a JPEG. RAW not only allows you to capture the highest quality photos, but the format also gives you greater editing flexibility. However, these benefits come at a cost, and that cost is space. RAW images have an enormous file size compared to JPEGs, and not every photo editor can handle them, including Google Photos. But now Google Photos on the web will give you two options for how to deal with these types of files. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.

The Index 01 records voice notes on a paired smartphone, and can also do things like set reminders and control music playback. The new ring is available for pre-order today for $75. Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models.

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The December Drop for Pixel phones introduced a significant display bug for some users. According to users’ reports, the display on their Pixel 10 randomly freezes after the phone has been resting for a while. This isn’t the first display bug that the Pixel 10 users have been facing. The December Pixel Drop, which arrived exactly a week ago , was primarily aimed at eradicating a punch list of issues troubling users of the Pixel 6 and above. But in fixing those bugs, Google may have triggered a handful of new ones. After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with.

The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",
