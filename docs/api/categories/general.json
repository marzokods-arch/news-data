With the option enabled, you can swipe down on the alphabet keys to enter symbols. The option works alongside the Touch &amp; hold option that also lets you select symbols, but by long-pressing a key. Google has been testing various ways to make typing on Android devices feel as effortless as possible. In addition to making voice typing much more efficient , Google has been experimenting with several Gboard tweaks, such as auto-switching to the English alphabet after you enter a symbol or punctuation mark. Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2. The feature was spotted rolling out to the beta channel last month, and is now also available on the stable channel, as highlighted by 9to5Google .",

The malware employs device-takeover tactics, including the abuse of accessibility services, overlay attacks, and SMS interception. Fraud and security systems that rely only on input rhythm or speed may struggle to catch Herodotus, making deeper device-environment monitoring vital. Researchers at cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric have identified a new Android banking trojan, dubbed Herodotus , that takes deception a step further by mimicking human behavior during remote-control sessions to avoid detection. The malware can intercept SMS messages to capture 2FA codes, deploy overlay pages to steal login credentials, and abuse accessibility services to log on-screen activity.

Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic.

For week seven’s Halloween Night, the Australian conservationist and his dancing partner Witney Carson performed a Tango to “Sweet Dreams are Made of This” by The Hampton String Quartet. In the clip, which can be seen in full below, Irwin, dressed-up like the Prince of Darkness, tangles with Carson on a fog-filled stage before taking the action to the main floor. Staying in theme to the bitter end, Irwin collects himself from the hardwood and is dragged to hell (or backstage) by dark forces, returning to face the judges with his face splattered in fake blood. The judges loved it, as Irwin and Carson collected 38 out of a possible 40 points, their best result yet in the competition which included two perfect 10s. It wasn’t enough, however, to take top spot on the night, as the pair was pipped by Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy with 39/40 . Irwin, the son of the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin, has a fine chance of emulating the success of his older sister Bindi, who won the 21 st &nbsp;season of&nbsp; DWTS , in 2015.

This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

So, it was only natural that I thought the OnePlus 15 would pick up right where it left off. But now that the phone has become official in China, I’m not quite so excited. Some of the rumored sidegrades and downgrades have come true, and it feels like OnePlus doesn’t care much about the well-rounded foothold it so recently established.

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung is starting to roll out an update to its Family Hub refrigerators in the US that will introduce a new widget that serves curated advertisements. Cover screen advertisements are scheduled to start showing up next week or later. You’ll have the option to dismiss these advertisements or turn the widget off. Last month, some Samsung Family Hub smart refrigerator owners began pointing out something peculiar about the update they received. The changelog for the update mentioned that the cover screen would begin displaying advertisements, among other information. A new update is now rolling out that will bring this to all Family Hub fridges with screens above a certain size. However, there is also a way for you to shut those ads down before they even start showing up. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Clock is dialing back its support for wallpaper backgrounds, to make sure you can still read the time. Google’s also beginning to remove references from Assistant within the app. Going forward, we may see a new “pulsing” effect for the time. These past few months have been busy ones for many of Google’s Android apps, as the company has been sprucing up their looks with a fresh touch of Material 3 Expressive . While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases. The good news is that Google is learning from your feedback, and already appears to be correcting just such an oversight.

We haven’t seen the update in the US yet. Samsung’s latest One UI 8 update got off to a shaky start. Since the software started rolling out in September, the company has paused distribution of its version of Android 16 on several of its phones . Now, though, it looks like the update is back on track on Galaxy S23 and S24. On Twitter, Tarun Vats has shared screenshots that show the Galaxy S23 and S24 series are once again able to download One UI 8 in South Korea. That should mean that the update will resume soon in other affected regions, as well.",

    "body": "TL;DR The OneXFly Apex is a new premium Windows gaming handheld from One Netbook. It features an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, an 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, and an 85Wh external battery. More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",
