In many ways, it's bringing together the best of Black Ops 6, 3, and 2, and stirring it in one giant pot to produce yet another potent brew that'll have me grinding Mastery camos once again. But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things. For the uninitiated, Overclocks are an upgrade system to apply new effects to your scorestreaks, field upgrades, and equipment. Each item has two levels, and the more you use them, the more you progress with them and boost their power. You can upgrade the Stim Shot to remove debuffs and boost your speed, increa…",

Such is the case with Vein , an early access zombie survival sandbox that aspires to be a hybrid of DayZ and Project Zomboid , and has quietly but consistently accrued an impressive following over the last few weeks. Broadly, Vein is a familiar affair, plonking you in an open world where civilization has been overrun by zombies and tasking you with staying alive in its sandbox. Like Zomboid, its appeal lies in its high level of granularity, with players able to interact with pretty much anything in its world.\"Open mailboxes, adjust faucets, and knock on doors,\" the game's Steam page promises, adding \"throw a can of beans at a zombie if you like.\" I do like. But all of this is presented in 3D, with dynamic seasons and highly perceptive undead. Even with a billion zombie survival games out there, you can see why fans of the genre might find Vein appealing. Even so, its launch has taken developer Ramjet Studios by surprise, so much so that it's having to readjust to compensate. Ramjet explained all this in its most recent w…",

That makes it more popular than Monster Hunter Wilds and Elden Ring Nightreign —at least as far as Steam is concerned. In short, there's plenty of motivation for Facepunch to keep Garry's Mod fresh, and its latest patch livens up how it looks and functions in several ways. Primarily, the November update improves Garry's Mod's water visuals, introducing fluid rendering features from more recent Source engine games. As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",

Alongside celebrating the sales milestone, Panik Arcade released a new update for CloverPit, one that primarily introduces a hard mode to the game. This mode unlocks once players win their first run with a rules-modifying memory card, giving you the option to play that run again while doubling the deadline amount, yielding a special reward if you succeed. Elsewhere, the update rebalances much of the experience, with Panik Arcade stating it has \"reworked loads of charms, values and other little details to make everything smoother and fairer\".

One design shift I will never understand, however, is the bizarre affliction that struck MMO designers in the latter half of that 2010s-2020s golden age: The sudden and irrational belief that tab-targeting MMOs (or hotbar MMOs, depending on your accent) are old news, and that every MMO had to have some sort of action combat system in it. It's similar to the strange pall that swept over RPGs, where turn-based games were believed to be poor craft, even though these past few years have more tha…",

    "body": "\"When I first showed them the boost jump, are you kidding me? They almost threw me out of the room.\" Former Call of Duty director Glen Schofield is recalling the day he pitched Advanced Warfare's signature mechanic to Activision. As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow. Nonetheless, Advanced War…",

In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

The sequel, Salt 2: Shores of Gold , made some big improvements in that regard, while also enhancing the series' PvE focus and adding an infinite, procedurally generated world to explore. After spending the last three years in early access—during which Salt 2 gained a main quest, cooperative multiplayer, skill trees and underwater exploration among other things—it has now left alpha development , blasting a broadside of new features into Salt 2's hull to round out the core experience.

When Jung tries one more time to nail it down, saying, \"For you, you're the founder?\" Wales goes off. \"Can I just say again, it doesn't matter. I've answered your question four times,\" he declares forcefully, no longer smiling. Then, after a momentary pause, he gets up quickly, saying, \"You know what? I'm done. Thank you.\" \"What's going on?\" Jung asks as Wales sai…",

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. My first night with Black Ops 7 went as well as expected. After scoping out the first few missions of the bizarre co-op campaign with friends, we hopped into 6v6 multiplayer, making a point to stick to the \"open\" playlists with \"minimal\" skill-based matchmaking. As I feared after the open beta, Black Ops 7 is shaping up to be another weak year for Call of Duty multiplayer, shining a light on the series' streak of diminishing returns. Much like Modern Warfare 3 (2023) to Modern Warfare 2 (2022), Blops 7 is very much an expensive expansion for Blops 6: Guns now have sci-fi greebling and Titanfall angles, but behave the same as last year. Its big movement \"innovation,\" the wall bounce, is barely there. Maps are plentiful and pretty, but remain in a structural rut so predictable in 2025 that you don't really need to play them to know their layout (it's almost always a box with three lanes).

Nonetheless, new data from Mercury Research shows that, despite the frosty reaction towards these chips from the PC hardware community at large, it doesn't appear to have made as much of a dent in Intel's desktop market share as you might expect. MR reports that Intel's slice of the desktop CPU market is 4.9% lower in the third quarter of this year, compared to Q3 2025. So, despite AMD having had a relatively bumper year for desktop CPUs, it still trails behind Intel with 33.6% of the market share.

This little device shoots out drones that chase down enemies and explode. And when I say chase, I mean it; these drones don't complain about having to travel halfway across the map to find a target. If that sounds incredibly annoying to play against, then you're spot on. They're easy enough to shoot, sure, but you're wasting ammo shooting them out of the sky (don't forget how long reloading takes), and they're the perfect distraction. While the drones are unlikely to score many kills (it requires two to hit a target to bag a kill), having one damage an enemy you're fighting is more than enough to seal the deal. It's basically an easy way to soften up the enemy or get them to fire their gun, wasting their ammo or even revealing them on the map if they're not using a suppressor.
