    "body": "The Outer Worlds 2 is here and it's pretty damn good in our view, but that doesn't mean it's spotless. It feels like any given RPG these days has to do the post-launch tango of bug fixes and tweaks to address all those crashes that slipped through the cracks. Being bigger and more ambitious than its predecessor didn't save the retrofuturistic RPG any trouble, if this week's patch is any indication: it packs a wallop of over 350 fixes by my count. There's not much sexy to talk about—no new goodies, no balance changes that'll induce tears of joy—instead, it's death by a thousand cuts, if death was an improved game and cuts were small adjustments. For instance, the Bomb Suit armor had an issue where it reduced explosive damage dealt rather than taken; that little quirk should be addressed now, saving any grenade enjoyers further perplexity. The whole list can be found in a blog post on Obsidian's website , and while there are a shedload of minute changes, there are some highlights. Companions are tankier overall now, \"especially on Hard and Very Hard difficulty settings,\" and party members like Tristan and Inez should no longer have a \"wants to talk\" icon when they aren't meant to.

If you're grinding for the Black Ops 7 Mastery Camos , then this is the one SMG that won't feel like you're banging your head against a wall. My recommendation is to start with the Dravec and hope that the other SMGs get a buff before you get around to them. You'll unlock the Dravec at level 34, but you can use it earlier than that if you have the Vault Edition of BO7, since this comes with a Mastercraft version of the gun. Either way, here's the best Dravec build in BO7.

Then charge $299 (AUD $499). It's a confident swing in a space dominated by Razer, SteelSeries, and Logitech, and for the most part, the Cloud Alpha 2 connects—if you actually need that base station. Battery life remains the headline. HyperX's previous Cloud Alpha Wireless —a long‑standing PC Gamer favorite for best wireless gaming headset until Razer took top honors— pulls a ludicrous 300 hours. The Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless, however, dials that back to a quoted 250. On paper it's a downgrade, but in real use it still feels like witchcraft. I gamed nightly, took Teams calls, and ran music on Bluetooth without ever thinking about the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 Wireless ' battery. Even with both radios active, it never died. I still haven't charged it since unboxing. \"Charge it once a month and forget about it\" still applies, and it keeps HyperX well ahead of rivals tapping out after around 40–70 hours. The new…",

It's packed with a beefier processor, higher-capacity RAM, and a better Wi-Fi chip than Meta's top device, the Meta Quest 3 , and this all makes me think Valve has the guts to step into the ring with the company previously known as Facebook. This is before mentioning that Valve seems to have a bit of a hidden blade up its sleeve in the form of an included USB dongle that connects to a specially sectioned antenna in the headset for wireless streaming. This, combined with foveated streaming , means that the headset can pick up on where you're looking, focus all of the higher quality juice into that section, and render everything at a lower quality. And that's not the only selling point for the Steam Frame. Valve's Lawrence Yang told us it \"represents a fundamental shift in the way that we look at VR.\" For the first time, SteamOS is on an Arm chip in the Frame. It can wirelessly connect to your rig to play your VR games, but also play non-VR games through the same controllers. It's all hitting the right notes for me. However, in my excitement for the new headset, I spotted a single note in the specs sheet that dampens it somewhat: Mono …",

The days of focusing on making headshots sound orgasmically thwacky are behind this company though, which has expanded its range to flight sim gear, controllers, and even direct drive wheels lately. And, after having acquired the quietly brilliant German innovator Roccat in 2019 and retired the brand name in 2024, it's now putting out gaming keyboard designs like the Vulcan under its own name. That brings us to this Vulcan II TKL , a full-size, tenkeyless board whose design and feature list will be like putting on comfy old shoes to anyone who tried the previous Vulcan, and whose Titan HS mechanical switches offer a really distinctive, linear sensation. Appraising gaming keyboards right now is tough, because it's become extremely specialised. Manufacturers are broadening their ranges to cater to as many preferred tactile sensations as possible, and weighing one up against another really does involve a lot of personal preference. That said, there are a few empirical factors like build quality that help the plight of poor, put-upon reviews like myself. In this case, the Vulcan II TKL makes a great first impression.

With plenty of details on what's inside this machine, and Valve's tactics for the Steam Deck , we have most of the information we need to take an educated guess at the price. We don't know anything more than we've already said in our various stories on Valve's Linux box. We're simply piecing together our expectations, Valve's history, the specs, and some amount of vibes-based optimism from the team—a large amount of vibes-based optimism from the team. I've tallied up an average from our guesses—or those of us brave enough to actually take a guess—and it's around $525. That's notwithstanding the difference between the smaller 512 GB model and the much larger 2 TB model, however, which may well cost in excess of $100 more based on today's Steam Deck OLED pricing.

Razer's latest V4 incarnation of the BlackWidow—ahem, sorry, BlackWidow Low-Profile Tenkeyless Hyperspeed —sticks in old-school mechanical territory, but pairs that ol' reliable tactical switch feel with low-profile keys that have a shorter travel from starting position to the bottom of the keypress.

After the not small upfront cost of building your very first rig, there's the regular rhythm of pricey hardware upgrades (to say nothing at all about the cost of repairs and replacement parts).

With that being said, Peak's newest patch update has decided to encourage players to continue doing this by buffing one of the game's most exploited items - the Scout Cannon. These updates mean the Scout Cannon can now launch zombies, which is perfect for anyone struggling to make their way through the Roots biome. The weight of the item has also been reduced from six to four, which is pretty huge news, as one of the sole reasons I don't carry it around is because of how heavy it is and how much stamina I lose when doing so. Outside of this, some smaller tweaks like making the cannon easier to jump out of and the forced ragdoll time being reduced have been made, too.

In that sense, it's quite reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. During a chat with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, I noted the shared DNA in Resident Evil 4 and Village, and asked if Requiem might have a similar relationship with any older entry in the series. He confirmed my theory with no hesitation: \"I believe in that regard, it's very close to Resident Evil 2,\" he said. Aside from the setting, Requiem also has a stronger focus on the qualities of its player-character than the last two instalments. Sure, Ethan Winters had a backstory, a personality, and a very pressing motive, but Kumazawa makes an interesting distinction between Ethan and Requiem's new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, who is extremely vulnerable and unused to confrontation or violence. \"When you look at Res…",

Helldivers 2, obviously, and lately we've seen Arc Raiders do extremely well.\" It's getting harder to predict what will pop off or stick around in the PC multiplayer space, which was much less crowded when Deep Rock entered early access in 2018. This year's unexpected smashes like Peak and RV There Yet? belong to a new crop of cheap, casual hangout games that became trendy in 2025. Heck, multimillion-selling Schedule 1 came out this year, too. Meanwhile, live service games from well-known stud…",

That's good news for two reasons: I enjoyed the first season (except for one part) and the final episode didn't really do much except set up a second season (that's the part). The series started out great. It gave the stale and yet seemingly never-ending Alien saga something it really needed: a kick in the butt. Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them. And instead of a xenomorph slowly picking off people one by one from the shadows, this big alien boi was just right out there in broad daylight, mass-murdering entire groups of people in mere seconds like a buzzsaw. Alien: Earth was pretty silly, but I liked the anything goes approach of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what slithers. But as the first season concluded it …",

It looks a whole lot like the original Steam controller, which hardly set the world ablaze. Also, it’s a gamepad. There are countless PC gamepads on the market, and many are better than what Microsoft or Sony have to offer. We have 1000 Hz polling rates, TMR sticks, and near-mandatory paddle buttons. Sometimes they even have a screen on them, and if you’re lucky, a sprinkling of RGB too. Surely we’re good.

But in recent years, a Photoshop of the ad has taken on a second life as the perfect memey encapsulation of Romero's social media interactions with former id designer Sandy Petersen. For more than four years, Romero has been politely but pointedly correcting every inaccurate memory and anecdote Petersen's shared on Twitter (now X) from his time working at id Software. Nearly each tweet begins with some variation of \"Hi Sandy, hope you're doing well\" before nuking the original statement from orbit. Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

That's largely kept me away from grand strategy and 4X games, which tend to offer the richest sandboxes to the most committed players, occasionally at the cost of accessibility to newcomers. The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops. In his review , online editor Fraser Brown said Age of Wonders 4 \"demands to be played over and over,\" and I concur.

Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results. No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling. (Image credit: Ubisoft) There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new \"creative house\" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that, though, was something of a low-key power struggle : Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft, but the founding Guillemot family …",
