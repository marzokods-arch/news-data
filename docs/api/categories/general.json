The so-called high-bandwidth dual inline memory module or HB-DIMM is designed to boost memory bandwidth courtesy of pseudo channels, buffer chips and intelligent signal routing. It looks very fancy, but we'll take some convincing it'll appear in PCs any time soon. Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says. The answer to that problem? \"The high-bandwidth DIMM (HB-DIMM). This approach seeks to use the benefits of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) format in a DIMM form-factor.\" Each HB-DIMM is primarily composed of memory chips and buffer chips. \"The data buffer chips are coupled to respective sets of the memor…",

I was a little frustrated that I only got a few minutes with it because it's not often you have a product that tries to genuinely innovate in a way that might actually make sense. That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting.

That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

She recently got a PC racing wheel so she can pop a podcast on and enjoy the simulated countryside of Germany pass her by in a more immersive fashion. My baby sister also has an actual car that she can actually drive (which is more than I ever managed). I'll admit, I don't really see the appeal of simulating an activity one could also readily engage in—so imagine my confusion when I heard about Deutschland's remote robotaxis. In the now-defunct Tegel airport in Berlin, drivers take to impressive driving simulator rigs to remotely control cars up and down the runway (via The Guardian ). Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that. Besides monitoring car movement on a generously sized triple monitor setup, the remote drivers also enjoy the plush cups of what appears to be the Logitech G430 wired headset. However, all of that pales in comparison to whatever high-grade…",

After following Shu through fields and some abandoned houses on your way to Rinko's house at the northeast side of Ebisugaoka, you'll stumble into a cutscene that'll lead you to a huge field shrouded in fog, with the only thing in sight being a group of scarecrows dressed as students. The scarecrow at the front will have a riddle plastered to its face. Your goal is simple: read the clue and try to figure out how it relates to one of the other scarecrows that are standing before them. Picking the wrong one can be fatal, as these scarecrows will come to life and attack you, meaning you'll potentially waste your health and your weapon's integrity. The riddle and answer will differ depending on which of the three difficulty settings (Story, Hard, and Lost in the Fog) you are playing on, but it pays to get everything right, as not only will you make it out of the fields unscathed, but there's also an achievement for picking the correct sc…",

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand.

However, the Disco Elysium comparisons don't seem to apply to protagonist Hershel Wilk, who appears to be a relapsed spy called back in to assemble a squad. I don't think that you'll be waking up hungover and naked in your hotel room at the start of Zero Parades. Hershel, the two off-screen characters in the State of Play trailer explain, hasn't been around for five years, but is still considered one of the best. That doesn't mean she won't get into trouble. There's a scene where she's being interrogated while strapped to a chair and getting up to some hijinks around the city wearing a rectangular mascot's jiggly head.

Deus Ex is a PC classic through and through, and as such, fans have kept the original fresh themselves with mods. GOG will supply you with fan overhaul Deus Ex: Revision , for instance. The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?)

Seeing the before and after pictures next to one another, it's clear how much was lost to the fog, aesthetically speaking. (Image credit: Konami / Fellow_Demo) The images with no fog look brilliant. The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine.

A quick primer before we get into the functionality. Both CS:GO and CS2 award their players weapon skins or cases for hitting various in-game milestones. The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50).

Game developers are increasingly turning to Secure Boot to ensure their anti-cheat software isn't bypassed. Battlefield 6 has become somewhat infamous for requiring Secure Boot, through EA's Javelin anti-cheat software, though Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat and Riot's Vanguard also require it. Secure Boot will be required to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, too.
