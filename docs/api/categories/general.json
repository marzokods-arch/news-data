    "body": "In late 2015, Ariana Grande &#8216;s seemingly frictionless ascendance to all-consuming pop superstardom had finally hit a tiny bit of turbulence. &#8220;Donutgate&#8221; and other small-scale controversies had put her in the media&#8217;s crossfire for the first time, while &#8220;Focus&#8221; — the planned lead single off her upcoming third album, then to be titled Moonlight — had disappointed commercially and left fans a little cold. It was nothing she couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t bounce back from, but in the meantime, she dropped a surprise release to celebrate the holiday season, and give both her sound and her career a little bit of a reset: the six-song EP Christmas &amp; Chill .
