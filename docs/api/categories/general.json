    "body": "Bad Bunny is focused less on spectacle and more on feeling as he prepares to headline the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show . In a new interview with Access Hollywood’s Scott Evans , the global superstar, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, opened up about the mindset behind his highly anticipated halftime performance, reflecting on his journey from bagging groceries to one of the biggest stages in the world. “I just want to be there,” Bad Bunny said when asked how he’s feeling in the final days before the show. “I’m just ready to do it. I want to feel it. I want people to watch it and enjoy it.” Selecting the setlist for the halftime performance proved to be one of the biggest challenges. “That was tough,” he admitted. “Even for my shows on tour, it’s hard to pick 30 or 40 songs. So imagine for 30 minutes. It was very hard. The selection process was very intense.” Rather than focusing on hits alone, Bad Bunny said he approached the show as a storytelling exercise. “I had a vision about the story, the mood, and the feelings that I want to put on that show,” he explained. “I want people to feel happiness and joy. I want to make people dance. I want to make them…",

The group was hugely successful, putting 20 singles in the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1967 and 1973 and winning two Grammys for record of the year, for “Up &#8211; Up and Away” and “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In.” And yet, they have been underrated in recent decades – ignored by the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame because they were so pop. Fortunately, the 5th Dimension got their flowers in 2021 with the release of Ahmir “ Questlove ” Thompson’s Oscar-winning documentary Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised). The group, along with Sly &amp; the Family Stone , Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder , performed at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which is chronicled in the documentary. Seeing footage of the group in 1969 – the peak year of their career – reminded people how truly great they were in their prime.
