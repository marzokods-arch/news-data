    "body": "TL;DR German-based brand, Tolino, just launched the Tolino Flip, a Bluetooth remote for turning the company’s e-book pages. The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

I say this because Samsung is the only manufacturer making Android devices that goes to the extent of remaking every menu and sub-menu, including even the highly ignored Digital Wellbeing dashboard. With its upcoming One UI 8.5 interface , Samsung could be taking a bold step towards reshaping the interface that has remained largely unchanged for the past two generations. Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

It recently announced that users will be able to uninstall pre-installed Meta apps, such as Facebook and Instagram, from their devices. This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

These thermostats can still be used, but you can no longer control them remotely, receive notifications, check the status in the Nest or Home app, or change settings from a mobile device. One Reddit user says they’re building a website/local server to restore these functions, and they may even build a mobile app if there’s enough traction. One of the biggest flaws with the concept of smart homes is planned obsolescence. That’s exactly what happened to the first- and second-generation Nest Learning Thermostat last week.

Google’s keenly aware of that: It offers a version of the YouTube app that’s explicitly made for children’s content in YouTube Kids, and earlier this year, rolled out a controversial AI-based age estimation system to automatically flag accounts that may be used by minors. These measures are meant in part to help Google avoid legal trouble — like a 2019 class-action suit filed in California accusing Google and YouTube of violating privacy laws by collecting information about minors for the purposes of advertising. The suit was eventually settled for a sum of $30 million, and now, according to Top Class Actions , affected users are able to submit claims to get a cut of that settlement.",

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",
