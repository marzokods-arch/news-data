In a new interview with IGN , creator Eric Barone listed a handful of features coming in the update, and one of them answers an oft-made demand from Stardew Valley die-hards: make kids interesting. Stardew Valley kids—ie, the children you raise yourself, not the diminutive NPCs roaming around town— are very boring. They just walk around your house and don't do much else. They don't grow, and they have few demands. They're quite unlike real children. \"What I will say without maybe being too specific is that with this update, one of the things we're trying to do is... Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting,\" Barone said. \"So I'm trying to do something with that, but there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it.\" Another confirmed new feature is two new marriage candidates.

Now that follow-up has arrived, and it's more bad news. CEO Dan Zou has announced the studio is shutting down completely. \"Since our last update in November, we've been grappling with the reality that Starlight Re:Volver did not achieve the commercial success we needed to sustain Pahdo Labs. We aimed high, spread ourselves too thin, and shipped a game that couldn't hold a healthy player base.\" Zou revealed that Pahdo spent the last few months working on a demo for a game in a similar style called Edge of Divinity, hoping to attract a new round of investors. \"We believed making a demo of a familiar but new game would be our best shot,\" Zou wrote, \"as it allowed us to demonstrate lessons learned in game design and market positioning in the quickest and clearest way possible.

Would it be Fallout 3's Washington D.C.? Maybe Fallout 4's Boston? Well, that could still happen, I suppose, but the finale of Fallout Season 2 suggests a few characters would remain in New Vegas, while another would be visiting somewhere new in Fallout Season 3—and it's a place no Fallout game has ever been set. In the closing moments of the final episode of Fallout Season 2, The Ghoul finally reaches the end of his main quest… except it's not the end. He discovers that his missing family are not inside their designated cryotubes in New Vegas after all, a major bummer after he spent 200 years searching for them. On the bright side, he now knows they're alive, and his wife Barbara has left him a clue as to where they are: he finds a postcard from Colorado in her cryotube.

But wait a minute… wasn't there another war in the works? A different war than the one approaching New Vegas? What's happening with that? Earlier in the season, Maximus seemingly kicked off a war between the various Brotherhood of Steel factions by bashing Paladin Xander Harkness in the head with a super sledge to stop him from slaughtering a bunch of ghoul children. It was the very thing elder cleric Quintus had warned him about, because if Harkness was killed it would touch off a civil war between the powerful Commonwealth BOS (where Harkness was from) and the weaker west coast BOS factions. We've heard nothing about that situation since the fourth episode of Fallout Season 2, and it's not revisited in the season finale……",

After episodes 6 and 7 came in at a mere 43 minutes long, I was hoping Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 would be a 90-minute corker with all the loose plot threads we've been following all season neatly wrapped up. Alas, the final episode of Fallout Season 2 , \"The Strip\", is another short one, clocking in at about 46 minutes, and it does more table-setting for Season 3 than wrapping up of Season 2. Don't fret, though: there's still a lot going on, a few fun reveals, some action, and a couple of resolutions. Right off the bat, we get one of the answers we've been waiting for, though it's not remotely surprising. The Legion's civil war comes to an end as Lacerta Legate drags Caesar's (the original Caesar, not the two interim Caesars) skeletonized corpse from the fray of battle and into a tent, where he finally reads the note of succession. The note reads \"I am Caesar. I am the Legion. It ends with me.\" Wow, who would have thought this monstrous, murderous dictator was also a selfish jerk?

I'm glad those days are over: Today's Helldivers 2 update added a long-awaited vehicle from the first game—the Bastion tank destroyer—and it's a work of art . Weighing in at approximately four kajillion pounds, the TD-220 Bastion MK XVI is a new free stratagem available to all players as part of Super Earth's full-on offensive toward Cyberstan , the Automaton stronghold in the outer reaches of bot territory. The tank(destroyer) seats four divers: a driver, a gunner, and two passengers on its shoulders. It's armed with a \"heavy coaxial machinegun\" and a \"120mm high-velocity cannon.\" To put that firepower in perspective: 120mm explosive rounds are the same ordinance that Super Destroyers drop in 120mm missile barrages. A left-click with a Bastion is enough to instantly wipe out any basic enemy and most enemy buildings (the ones that don't have to be hellbombed), and the tank comes stocked with over 20 ro…",

One of Nesmith's themes is how Bethesda tweaks its games for mass appeal, even when this involves dialling back the complexity of certain systems. But when it comes to the studio's future titles (Nesmith no longer works at Bethesda), he thinks one recent example in particular has shown a way forward. \"I would probably look at two things [to shake up],\" says Nesmith. \"I would probably look at having the world be more dynamic. \"Bethesda games in the last decade have become less dynamic in order to meet the needs of what the games needed and audience expectations, but to be able to have the world be more fluid, I think that would be very cool.\" The example Nesmith cites is Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, which received a whopping 97% from PC Gamer's Fraser Brown and scooped our 2023 game of the year award .

That's a tricky thing to navigate when determining value here, as nothing is as good value as it was five months ago, but I have generally little bad to say about the Element Pro. It's solid. Starting with its choice of components, it comes with an Asus Prime RX 9070 XT 16 GB, which isn't far off the choice of graphics card I'd choose for a PC build of my own right now. It's capable at 4K and has 16 GB of VRAM. That alone is sure to make some gamers swoon. Though you don't get to switch on DLSS, FSR is a decent alternative. And the Prime card, including a triple-fan shroud, is pretty cool and quiet—reaching a mere 61 °C in my testing in Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition.

I got to speak to design director Maria Hamilton recently, who said she's been wowed by the tools themselves: \"I think the first thing that I said on seeing where they were really early on was 'Oh my god, I want those tools', because they are vastly better than what many designers are using for building out areas.\" She clarifies that she means non-specialised designers, noting that \"If you're a worldbuilder, if that's your job, then you have really excellent mastery of very good complex tools.

Of course, TV and monitor formats and resolutions are not all exactly the same. See 1440p and ultrawide monitors for proof, equally, of that. Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015. Indeed, what little 8K TV sales there have been peaked in 2022. Consequently, the likes of LG and Sony are entirely exiting the 8K market .

Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP.

At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem.

For some reason, that's only been marked down 60%, or $10 more for only five of the series' six games⁠—the furtive Dragon Commander, so easily forgotten… 23 bucks feels like a steal for Original Sin 2 alone. Our 2017 game of the year remains a fresh, surprising RPG almost a full decade after launch. And don't believe the haters : Its magic/physical armor system is actually brilliant , and it's an incalculable loss for all mankind that Larian will not be revisiting it in the upcoming Divinity. That's just \"Divinity\" coming soon, nothing Divine, Beyond, 2, Dragon Commander, Original Sin, or Original Sin 2 about it. As for how to tackle this bottomless brunch buffet of RPG, we have a full guide to the series and how we recommend approaching it. For the TL,DR: Go in more or less reverse order of release until you stop having fun, but ski…",

So, wouldn't it make sense for Bethesda to make lightning strike twice? People love Skyrim even more than Fallout, so shouldn't Bethesda try to turn The Elder Scrolls into a TV series, too? Maybe not! Bruce Nesmith, lead designer on Skyrim, doesn't think so, anyway. In an interview with PressboxPR , Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 during the development of Starfield, laid out the reasons it wouldn't make sense for Bethesda to try to duplicate what it's done with the Fallout show. \"What you have to realize about things like the Fallout TV show is that they don't make Bethesda money directly,\" Nesmith said. \"I would be shocked if Bethesda is making any money that they care about really, not when you make literally billions of dollars on Skyrim. What you're going to make by licensing the IP to this TV show is just peanuts.\" If the Fallout show isn't making Bethesda money, what is it doing? \"What it gets you is notoriety. It's marketing. Do they really need marketing for Elder Scrolls 6?\" he said. Nesmith also said the setting of Skyrim is \"a stan…",
