    "body": "Tame Impala pulled a few tricks—and fan-favorite treats—out of the vault on Halloween night in Brooklyn. Kevin Parker brought his Deadbeat Tour to Barclays Center on Thursday (Oct. 31), performing the live rarity “Sundown Syndrome” for the first time in seven years. The psych-pop gem, originally released as Tame Impala’s debut single in 2009, hadn’t appeared on a tour setlist since 2018. The moment came midway through night three of a four-night sold-out run at the arena, with Parker and his touring band all dressed in costumes nodding to Parker’s “scarf-era” aesthetic from the early 2010s. The Halloween chaos didn’t stop there. Comedian and longtime Tame Impala fan Eric Andre made an unexpected cameo—inside the show’s bathroom cam. Parker has famously included a backstage toilet feed on tour to give fans a surreal behind-the-scenes moment mid-set. This time, Andre took over the screen, sharing a quick on-camera kiss with Parker, eliciting laughter and cheers from the crowd. “Sundown Syndrome” joins a string of surprises from the Deadbeat tour, which kicked off earlier this week in Brooklyn with the debut of several new tracks and a cover of Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.” The run supports…",

The Blink-182 drummer marked his son’s birthday on Saturday (Nov. 1) with a heartfelt Instagram tribute, posting a photo of Rocky wearing a backwards cap and a black jersey with the number “13” on it. “Happy Birthday my Rocky 13 🖤. You’re such a special soul, and you make every day brighter. I love you,” Barker wrote. “No one’s cooler. Guitars, drums, pirates, boom boom pow and Angus Young forever 🎸🥁🏴‍☠️🥊,” he added in the post, which received thousands of likes and birthday messages — including a comment from Khloé Kardashian: “Happy birthday to the cutest!!!!! Rocky!!!!!!! 🩵🩵🩵.” Rocky was born in November 2023, marking the first child together for Kardashian and Barker, who tied the knot in 2022. The couple introduced their son publicly in December of that year with a joint Instagram post simply captioned, “ROCKY 🖤.” Last year, Rocky also received an unforgettable gift: a handwritten birthday letter from Rocky star Sylvester Stallone himself. “One of the most special Birthday gifts,” Travis wrote on Instagram Stories on Nov. 4, 2024, alon…",

The Pretty Reckless frontwoman has re-recorded “Where Are You Christmas?” 25 years after first performing the song as Cindy Lou Who in How the Grinch Stole Christmas . The reimagined version appears on the band’s new holiday EP, Taylor Momsen’s Pretty Reckless Christmas , released Friday (Oct. 31) via Fearless Records. The original ballad, co-written by Mariah Carey, James Horner, and Will Jennings, first appeared on the 2000 film’s soundtrack and was famously performed by Momsen at just seven years old. That same year, Faith Hill’s version reached No. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. Momsen’s 2025 update opens with a nostalgic snippet of her childhood recording before launching into a full-blown rock version, anchored by crunchy guitars and her signature gritty vocals. “Where are you, Christmas? Why can’t I find you?” she sings, giving the wistful lyrics new energy and edge. The six-track EP also includes four original songs — “I Wanna Be Your Christmas Tree,” “Christmas Is Killing Me,” “Blues on Christmas,” and “When We Were Young” — as well as a reprise titled “Christmas, Why Can’t I Find You.” “ Pretty Reckless Chr…",
