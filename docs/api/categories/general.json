    "body": "Veteran punk outfit NOFX are opening the vault on four decades of chaos, excess and survival with a new feature-length documentary titled 40 Years of F**kin’ Up , which is currently in post-production. The band revealed details of the project on Friday (Jan. 17), with founding member Fat Mike confirming the film’s status while appearing at The Punk Rock Museum’s NOFX exhibition. According to Fat Mike, the documentary does not shy away from the most extreme, uncomfortable or self-destructive chapters of the group’s history. “Most people wouldn’t be OK with releasing a film that shows footage of getting whipped in their dungeon, or their drug use for the past 20 years, or dressing up like a rubber cheap whore, or the ambulance ride when they were naked while puking and shitting blood… I’m not like most people,” Fat Mike said. Directed by James Buddy Day, 40 Years of F**kin’ Up traces NOFX’s evolution from teenage punks to one of the most influential and polarising bands in modern punk history. The documentary features extensive interviews with the band’s core lineup — guitarist Eric Melvin, lead guitarist El Hefe and drummer Erik Sandin — all of whom also serve as executive producer…",

However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Distributing your music as an independent artist can be tricky. Yes, you have outlets like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and even YouTube, but if you&#8217;re looking to move your work over to major platforms including Apple Music, Spotify or Tidal, it&#8217;s not as easy as hitting the upload button. To help distribute your music to an even wider audience, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about distributing your music as an independent artist. For signed artist, your label should take care of all this for you, but if you&#8217;re independent, to share your music on major streaming platforms you&#8217;ll have to go through a third-party distributor. With sites like DistroKid , the process to upload your music becomes a lot more simpler. The platform will handle most of the work for you, pushing tracks and albums to major streamers, automatically adding metadata and song credits to each platform, schedule release dates and upload as many track as you …",

    "body": "Since releasing her debut solo album, 1967’s&nbsp; Hello, I’m Dolly ,&nbsp; Dolly Parton &nbsp;has changed the face of the entertainment industry. Kicking down doors for female performers in both country and pop music, she has soared in the worlds of books, television, philanthropy and movies &#8212; and pretty much whatever else she tackled. On Jan. 19, Parton &#8211; who has topped the Billboard Hot 100 twice and Billboard &#8216;s Hot Country Songs a whopping 25 times &#8212; is turning 80 years old. Her expansive roster of hits reads like a “best of” list of the 1970s and 1980s, and it remains one of the strongest song catalogs of any singer-songwriter in any genre. As a writer, she has penned everything from poignant, detailed ballads about life in the Great Smoky Mountains, where she grew up, to some of the most defining love songs of all time. Her prowess as a songwriter and performer is so great, it earned her a historic induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022 &#8212; an accomplishment she almost didn&#8217;t accept, telling Billboard at the time that she didn&#8217;t feel like she &#8220;measured up&#8221; to past inductees.

    "body": "As most artists do, Taylor Swift often turns to prominent DJs and producers, and sometimes her fellow pop stars, to create remixes of her singles. Ed Sheeran , R3hab , Seeb, Shawn Mendes , Clean Bandit , Elvira , Bleachers , LP Giobbi and The Chainsmokers are among those tapped to turn Swift’s work into something new. Alternate versions of her tracks like “Everything Has Changed” from Red ; “Wildest Dreams” from 1989 ; “Delicate” from Reputation ; “You Need to Calm Down,” “Lover” and “Cruel Summer” all from Lover ; “willow” from evermore ; “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) ; “Anti-Hero” and “Lavender Haze” from Midnights ; “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from The Tortured Poets Department ; and “The Fate of Ophelia” from The Life of a Showgirl are perfect, whether your dance floor is at the club, in your living room or at a wedding reception.

Officially described as a &#8220;mystery-show&#8221; style album, the boy band&#8217;s latest interweaves four narrated chapters (delivered in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese via the EP&#8217;s four different language versions), a skit (also delivered in each version&#8217;s native tongue), and six fresh K-pop songs that all act as connective pieces to one larger, immersive narrative — a major break from the typical collection of potential hit singles released for most mini albums. The record is crafted to be consumed from start to finish, with the narrations advancing the plot and the songs bringing a range of emotional highs and lows. Still, for the purpose of this review, we&#8217;ll stick to reviewing each track from the English version of the album on its own individual merit.
