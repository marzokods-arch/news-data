But that's okay, because as it so happens, they're both actually pretty good. Well, in the case of the new DLSS 4.5, it's mostly good. With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas. You'll probably need to restart the app after that so that the program can che…",

Naked dwarves, anyone? Dwarf Fortress is nothing if not granular, and this extends down to individual dwarves having to be clothed, and this clothing itself having considerable complexity with regards to quality, use, etcetera. The previous update suddenly had dwarves appearing in both the units screen and the citizens list without any clothes, though in-game they still went about as if fully clothed. The new hotfix says it's a \"small release to fix the freeze issue and the naked dwarves.\" There's a handful of other notes alongside it, including the mysterious \"made female peachick visible again\", so presumably invisible female peachicks have also been running around players' fortresses.

Lian Li is offering to replace the SX Platinum Series PSU's power cables, but not because they are in any way faulty. Instead, it's because initial batches of the platinum white cables look ever so slightly \"purple\" . Lian Li wrote, \"After further review, we agree that the current white cables do carry a noticeable purple hue, which may not be visually ideal for certain PC build aesthetics. For users who prefer a cleaner and more unified look, we’re happy to provide a replacement set of pure white cables to replace the existing ones and better complement their PC builds.\" Placed side-by-side, the difference is subtle but undeniable. Folks looking to replace their loosely lilac power cables need only submit a request via Lian Li's support request form .

An omnipresent hazard with community creation tools is content created in bad taste, and soon enough Rockstar had an absolute all-timer on its hands. One player used the tools to put together a mission called \"We are Charlie Kirk\", in which players recreate the assassination of the rightwing political commentator and content creator Charlie Kirk.

The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile.” The end of 2025 saw a bump in the market share of Lenovo, HP, and Dell, with Apple and Asus seeing slight drops from the same period in the previous year.

Videogame sequels usually come with the caveat that it's totally OK to skip the original. Even if doing so actually seems a bit absurd, like a direct follow-up to a story-driven RPG. It makes sense: devs don't want to give people too many reasons not to pick up their new game. But My Winter Car is a sequel to a game that was specifically advertised as \"not fun\". It's not going for mass appeal. Instead of the challenge level starting from scratch, it's meant to build on the trials and tribulations you faced in the original game. It features \"added challenge for those who can master the original game,\" the Steam page warns.

To coincide with this new challenge, training dummies are available as part of the DLC too.

Created in partnership with Bushiroad and releasing July 30 this year, the Palworld Official Card Game \"is a 2-player competitive card game where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals.\" Which, so far you could swap out the word \"Pals\" for \"Pokémon\" and have a perfectly accurate description of the Pokémon TCG. But it is different, I promise. From the blurb, it sounds like basebuilding will form a key part of the whole Palworld Official Card Game experience , much as you can in the videogame. \"Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory.\" And that's about all there is to know at this point, though you can watch a video where a bunch of different Pals burst out of playing cards if that appeals. I suspect Pocketpair will reveal more details according to its own sch…",

Which is fair, works in progress are, indeed, works in progress . It'll really depend on which direction Larian swings the needle—D&D's action economy has a heavy reliance on crowd control, given you only have one action per turn (alongside a bonus action and movement). While DoS2 was also crowd-control heavy, you also had a bunch of action points to spend—which, via certain abilities, could be refreshed, allowing for some …",

Even then Anthem had its diehards, and the patches and updates that followed addressed some of its more significant flaws.
