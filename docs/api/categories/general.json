Lucky for us geeks and tech lovers, though, this is an excellent opportunity to grab some great products at a discounted price to start enjoying them a bit earlier than holiday shoppers. I’ve been a Pixel user since 2017 and have tried nearly every Pixel, Pixel Watch, and Pixel Buds out there. So, I’m here to help you weed out the dud deals among Google’s discounted hardware, and find the ones that actually make the most sense — you know, the ones I’d actually buy if I didn’t already have them in front of me.",

As the competition over wireless customers continues to heat up between the big three, we’ve seen T-Mobile begin to outshine its competitors in some ways. To combat this, Verizon and AT&amp;T are both working hard to win new users. To that end, Verizon recently announced a new Switchers promotion , and now AT&amp;T has something new up its sleeve as well: a free smartphone every year for three years . The catch? You’ll need to bundle AT&amp;T home internet with cellular service. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C.

Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G.

Gemini recently arrived on Google Home, bringing a conversational interface to the platform . This updated interface allows you to ask questions or let Gemini scour through security camera footage for you, eliminating the need for manual labor. The best features, such as Ask Home and Home Brief, of the newly introduced Google Home experience, unfortunately, require a subscription . The Standard and Advanced tiers of the newly introduced Google Home Premium subscription replace the existing Nest Aware and Aware Plus monthly plans.
