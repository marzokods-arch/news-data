In 2024, Waze announced that it would launch a new feature called “Conversational Reporting.” The feature aims to make it easier to submit road hazard reports. Since the announcement, the feature has only been available in beta. A year later, Conversational Reporting is finally starting to roll out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority Last week, Google announced its new Home smart speaker , focusing on Gemini integration, 360° audio, and the stereo pairing ability with a Google TV Streamer. From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G.

While Google prompts users to upgrade, the poorly worded messaging fails to effectively convey the benefits.

The Standard and Advanced tiers of the newly introduced Google Home Premium subscription replace the existing Nest Aware and Aware Plus monthly plans. And with this, Google is asking some users to pay more than they are used to.",

Foldables are the one smartphone category that still feel fresh to me despite the first foldable phone releasing almost six years ago. It’s also why the Pixel 10 Pro Fold matters so much, despite being relatively late to the game, Apple notwithstanding. Google controls Android, so its approach to foldables sets expectations for how the platform should evolve.
