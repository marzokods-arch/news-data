It wasn't until the in-game recipe book was introduced in 2018 that I no longer had to rely on the internet to tell me what I needed, but by this point the crafting guide wasn't needed. I had confidently memorised how to craft every single possible item in Minecraft and yes, I flexed that knowledge whenever I could. But it didn't take long for the sheer number of updates and drops to overwhelm my ability to retain all of this incredibly vital information, and I'll admit, the crafting recipe book has been my best friend as of late. But I didn't quite realise how little I now know about crafting in-game until I played Crafting Loop , a browser game that tasks you with crafting as many items as possible in ten seconds, showed me that actually I do not know a single recipe off by heart anymore. In my defense, it's not like you can just go in and start by crafting simple things like wooden planks, followed by sticks, and then torches and tools. You know, the class…",

Now, another joins their number: Danny Trejo, Hollywood actor and, as of recently, Bethesda reply guy. Bethesda was making all manner of hullabaloo about its Fallout Day celebration in the run-up to the event. That includes, of course, social media posts. One day before the event, Bethesda posted a reminder to its Instagram, urging fans to tune in for announcements and merch drops about Fallout 76 and Fallout 4. Our Danny wasn't distracted. He was in there like a flash on his official Danny Trejo Instagram account: \"Remaster New Vegas boss! 🔥\" our hero demanded , right there in Todd Howard's backyard.

According to Schafer, whose acclaimed adventure game studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2019, Spencer and the software giant have been true to their word, at least in his experience. \"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'\" Schafer said. \"And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.'

Without spoiling anything here myself, I'll just say the main issue seemed to be about how abrupt it felt and that certain characters behaved in a way that didn't line up with the rest of the story. Basically, Hades 2 had a surprisingly tidy ending for a story about messy gods. The negative reactions must've been strong enough to prompt developer Supergiant Games to start working on a way to contextualize—not change—the ending.

    "body": "Borderlands 4 hasn't done terribly for itself—some terrible UI design choices and stuttery framerates weren't enough to stop it from landing a solid critical reception (including from yours truly in my Borderlands 4 review ). That's been reflected in the sales it's gathered in the US. Per analyst firm Circana (via Gamesindustry.biz ), Borderlands 4 has Gearbox counting stacks for the foreseeable future: It was the number one US best-seller for the month of September (August 31 to October 3, to be specific). Not just that, but it's sold 30% more than Borderlands 3's debut, and stands as the fastest-selling game in the franchise's history. Exactly how many stacks is a different ballgame. Borderlands 4, according to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, had more than twice the budget of Borderlands 3 (assuming he wasn't just being hyperbolic, which is always possible ). Whether or not these nippy sales are enough to categorise it as an unmitigated success for Pitchford are entirely dependent on what his studio's goals are. Also raising eyebrows are the fact that Borderlands 4 went on sale earlier this month. Past the cutoff point for Circana's data, mind, but given Pitchford's past words warn…",

The company even tailors products to women, that are then advertised by women , and which appear to sell well among women. That's why it's surprising to see the company deploy an advert that plays on a sexist stereotype of women. Here's how the ad plays out: A woman and a man are sat on a sofa. The woman is speaking to the man. The man is holding a controller and wearing a gaming headset. The man reaches for his headset to turn on Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). The audio of the woman's voice ceases and the man continues to play his game. The next shot is the same pair walking down a corridor, once again the woman's voice is mostly muted. Then the same skit again while the pair are sat in gaming chairs. @razer ♬ original sound - Razer The on-screen caption reads: Active Noise Cancellation: on Drama: off The caption below the video reads: \"Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning.\" Clearly, the video plays to an old-fashioned trope.

The work of a Redditor who goes by the call sign veloci_official , this powering-up solution involves a pair of flip switches and key activator as gateway keepers to the all-important \"Start\" button which is, of course, housed beneath a clear, flip-up cover. Each element sports an all-caps label—POWER, FUEL, IGNITION, START—fitted slightly askew for a pleasing DIY-come-military vibe. The flip switches and turn-key are, in effect, only contact switches that act to enable the \"Start\" button. In other words, once the PC is running, an accidental knock of one of those switches or a twitch of the key won't do anything other than make the Start button inoperable, thereby making accidental shutdowns, perhaps courtesy of a passing feline, far less likely.

All three have been heavily involved in The Sims community and the developer itself for a number of years—they've all contributed towards packs either through creating lots or collaborating on kits like Plumbella's Pastel Pop Kit and lilsimsie's Comfy Gamer Kit. James Turner has created all manner of tools and mods over the years too, as well as formerly running custom content website The Sim Supply.

The first half of the game crescendos with a pair of classic Obsidian conversation boss fights, and I had a big, dumb smile on my face as I contemplated long, scrolling lists of dialogue options⁠—some available to me, some greyed-out—gated by different skills, background traits, quest choices, and even an out-of-the-way optional conversation I'd had over 10 hours previously.
