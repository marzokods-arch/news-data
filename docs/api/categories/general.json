Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

I knew from the first time I got my hands on it last year that it had the potential to be the kind of game MMO players have wanted for a long time—including me. And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game.

A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things?

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.

Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

Depending on how you hold it, your fingers and palm are in near-constant contact with a digital rodent, so it had better feel good underneath your most sensitive appendages. Stop giggling at the back, I know where you were going. Anyway, the myAir.0 OriMouse came to my attention this morning (via PC Watch ). It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing. Otherwise, I think it looks like a pretty neat technical achievement. The sensor …",

The laws of physics have a tight grip on audio reproduction, and the sad fact is that large, expensive speakers will always be better than smaller ones, as well as looking cooler and making you more attractive to the kind of people you want to be found attractive by. These are facts. Another fact is that, luckily, it's quite easy to upgrade from monitor speakers, which are only getting smaller and therefore worse as displays (and indeed laptops, which suffer from the same audio blight) get thinner to actual PC speakers . This soundbar from Creative, the Sound Blaster GS3 , isn't exactly huge either, and doesn't cost a lot of money. It's an entry-level audio solution for desktop PC gaming, and while it's always going to be better than using the speakers built into your screen—or indeed having no speakers at all—let me be clear, you shouldn't expect miracles. That said, there's a lot to like here. It's a stubby little bar perfectly sized to sit on the flat part of your monitor stand's foot, with two little rubber feet to stop it sliding around.

And even though Ubisoft has confirmed that it's working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell, we haven't heard hardly anything about it in several years. I even took the opportunity to ask Splinter Cell: Blacklist director Guillaume Dousse if he could shed some light on the next Splinter Cell game when we chatted last week, but he regretfully said he didn't have \"the security clearance\" to get us any new info.

But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards.

The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",
