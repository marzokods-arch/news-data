Memes have become an essential mode for how very online pop fans — basically all pop fans in 2025 —&nbsp;celebrate, engage with and occasionally even lightly poke fun at their favorite pop stars. But those pop stars don&#8217;t write, plan or release those memes, and often times they either refuse to interact with them or don&#8217;t acknowledge them until they&#8217;ve long run their course. They may occasionally drop a video or post or performance with one or more highly memeable moments, but whether or not they hit is still at the mercy of the wild and unpredictable whims of the internet, and what we all choose to latch onto.

The update keeps all original settings, such as hosts, co-hosts, and recording permissions, while giving you a refreshed link for added protection. Previously, recurring meetings reused the same link, making it easy for anyone with an old URL to slip into future sessions. Do you remember when “Zoom bombing” was all over the news? While the frenzy has died down, the threat to your online privacy and productivity never really went away. If you have an old Google Meet link in a recurring calendar event, it could be an easy way in for unwanted guests. To address that concern, Google has rolled out a new update that helps keep gatecrashers out for good whenever you change a meeting’s recurrence or start time in Google Meet.",

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Fitbit is developing an experimental, generative AI feature called “Plan for Care.” The feature could seemingly analyze symptoms to suggest possible conditions and urgency, and create a prep sheet for doctor visits. The feature could be restricted to legal adults in the US whenever it initially rolls out. If you’ve ever felt anxious about a doctor’s visit, you’re not alone. Many of us feel the same: We’re either too nervous to recount all our symptoms and miss details, or don’t know enough to ask the right questions after a diagnosis. Google appears to have identified this as a problem area to tackle, as Fitbit may be working on a new experimental feature that could help prepare you for your doctor’s visit.

Its sibling phone, the OPPO Find X9 Pro, boasts an even larger 7,500mAh cell, making them two of the largest battery capacities available on global markets. For comparison, the Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max features a 5,080mAh cell, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL offers 5,200mAh, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra boasts around 5,000mAh. Those were considered very robust capacities just a few months ago, despite being slightly smaller than the first-wave of 6,000mAh Si-C batteries.

It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans. We’ve now spotted one more new feature coming to the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, which could allow users to easily locate their phone with the click of a button.

The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 . Meanwhile, Google doubled down on Material You, releasing Material 3 Expressive as part of Android 16 for Pixel phones, tablets, and watches. One is minimalist, the other maximalist.

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

    "body": "Credit: YouTube TL;DR Team of developers who kept Pebble watches afloat after the company’s shutdown now accuse the founder of “stealing” their work. While Rebble and Core Devices had initially agreed to work together, the former now claims to disagree over the terms. Rebble alleges that Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, could build a “walled garden,” restricting further open-source app development. Update: Nov 19, 2025 (1:55 AM ET): Eric Migicovsky responded with a blog explaining his stance. He says while the agreement between Rebble and Core includes a licensing fee of $0.20 per user per month, Rebble assert a 100% claim on its app store data. He counter-accused Pebble of “attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016,” and added he’s “working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source.”",

In simpler terms, your employer will now be able to read your RCS chats in Google Messages despite end-to-end encryption. Encryption will still work when messages are traveling between devices, but employers will be able to use common archival apps to keep a record of RCS messages for legal and compliance purposes. Google says employees will see a notification when archival is active on their phones. Google is rolling out a new RCS message archival feature for fully managed Pixel phones. The system is designed to help companies comply with strict rules around record-keeping and legal requests for employee communication. But there is something employees should know: if you use a Pixel as your work phone, your RCS chats may be visible to your employer.",
