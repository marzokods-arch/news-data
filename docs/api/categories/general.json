For as much obvious Earthbound DNA there is in the massively popular Undertale, there's also a critical bit of Moon in there, too. After working on some RPGs at Squaresoft early in his career, Kimura satirized the genre by having you go around healing monsters with kindness instead of killing them. Fox's love for Moon helped convince Kimura to get it translated and released on Steam and Switch after two decades. (Image credit: tobyfox) Their friendship, I realized within a few minutes of talking with Kimura in Tokyo last month, also makes him careful to avoid piggybacking off of Undertale's popularity even if he'd have a good case for doing so. \"The most important thing for me when talking about Toby Fox in public is that I really like him, and because I really like him and respect him. I don't want anyone to get the impression I'm trying to use his name,\" Kimura told me. \"Undertale itself is a great game—playing it really moved me. It hit me in the soul, rather than the feels.

Free updates promise to bring new difficulty settings and farming items, improved NPC AI, boats, a brewing system, plus exercise equipment that lets you convert your bench presses into energy.

That number comes from SteamDB , which shows Battlefield 6 jockeying with Dota 2 for second most-played game on Steam right now behind the platform's perennial #1, Counter-Strike 2. The number has been left to simmer for a bit as I write this on a Sunday morning, but sits proudly at around 600,000 active players regardless. With a bit more oomph as the game builds up steam, it might just overtake Baldur's Gate 3's historical peak of 875,000 simultaneous players, which would put it very close to the all-time top ten . Still, it's overtaken the likes of Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and notably, any Call of Duty game on the platform, so even if it plateaus from here it is a seismic release. The campaign might be a little dismal; PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter noted \"it's an achievement that the Battlefield 6 campaign finds a way to make its tan…",

At the end of this month developer Northplay is running a closed alpha playtest, and you can sign up to test its tyrannosaurs right now. In a Steam post , Northplay explained the closed alpha will comprise a \"small slice\" of Dinolords, though to my eye it looks like a sizeable slab of stegosaur steak. The closed alpha will let players get hands-on with a three-part tutorial, after which they'll be able to explore four distinct maps, two different game modes, and a \"'campaign' setup with cross-level progression.\" That's enough to give Fred Flintstone indigestion. All of this will let players experiment with Dinolords' core systems, which includes typical RTS mechanics like basebuilding and unit control, as well as the more ARPG-inspired combat.

Johnson's response was brief, but candid. \"I can say that a new game is in the planning stage. We intend to make it happen,\" he replied. Unlike 2019's Back in the Groove, this game won't be developed by Johnson's company HumaNature Studios, though some contributors to that project will be involved. \"It's going to be developed by a third party, [with] design led by the infamous and talented producer of BitG, Nap,\" Johnson elaborated.

Salvatore dished on some of the unique challenges of writing stories that have to stay consistent with an ever evolving tabletop ruleset and world state. Salvatore has notably contributed to the Star Wars Expanded Universe (RIP), but is most famous for his novels set in the Forgotten Realms, a world shared with classic PC games including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and most of the Gold Box RPGs. Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D. I'm not making any judgements⁠—positive or negative⁠—on any of the editions, but the chang…",

No enemy is safe from the barrage of projectiles that cover the entire screen and hit for billions of damage. Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters.

It's called Miliastra Wonderland and it's such a blatant copy of Roblox that it's funny to listen to people explain it without making the obvious comparison. Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play. There will be a whole Roblox-style catalogue of user-created games spanning several genres, including FPS, roguelike, management sim, and survival.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is one of the most infamous misfires of gaming history, a disaster of a scale that's relatively rare in the upper echelons of game development. Virtually everyone who played it at the time acknowledged that it was a buggy, broken, unfinished mess, and there were rumblings that Gearbox outsourced large portions of the game's development while it focused on building Borderlands 2. There's been little inclination to reappraise Colonial Marines since, and I'm not really interested in this either.

Oh, and a camera for taking photos of cryptids with. Lone Pine National Park contains several undocumented species and it's your job to document them. First you'll have to lure them out, which means learning a little about each one, and then solving a puzzle to get their attention. The photography minigame is surprisingly involved, with shutter speed and aperture to control as well as zoom. It's not complicated enough to be a faff, at least not in the demo I played at PAX Australia, but it makes \"photograph\" a pleasing addition to the short list of verbs Lone Pine gives you. The one thing that gave me pause was a puzzle that I got stuck on because I couldn't match two drawings of a dog's head. One was just a t…",

EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks.

The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change—specifically, the name of the mod.

Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way).

Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\". In other words, not triggering some key bit of mission info in dialogue might leave you in mission limbo forevermore. \"Don…",

The Rubik's WowCube comes with 24 LCD screens and an AI-based application that tracks the time you've spent playing with it, alongside the number of twists you've made. The official website says the WowCube is \"the most advanced toy you can gift\", claims it is \"10 x better\" than the standard Rubik's Cube—which you'd expect, given it's 20 x more expensive. Alongside this, the website is pitching a WowClub Pass, which comes with the Mindhub AI app, a monthly games catalogue, extra widgets for the cube, an app for building apps, and member discounts on future cubes. It sounds like Rubik's is all but shipping a battle pass with this new electronic device. This is not the first WowCube to exist. Cubios (the company behind it) announced a WowCube before at the same price point, but this is a collaboration with Spin Master, which paid $50 million for the Rubik's Cube brand at the start of 2021. It seems like the basic cube idea is the same (slap 24 screens to a Rubik's Cube). I paid $200 for Panic's Playdate , a tiny yellow device that let…",

That's if Battlefield 6's launch concurrents, which smashed past GTA 5, Among Us, Starfield, and other heavy-hitters to become the 20th most-played game in SteamDB's records about, uh, 25 minutes after launching. As I write this, the game sits at a current and all-time peak of 521,000 concurrent players. I think most of them are in a queue. Queues, like hell, do the numbers. This is quite impressive, and I imagine is just the kind of thing that DICE and, less salubriously, EA wanted to see when it hit the big red launch button on its latest entry in the series. I wasn't kidding when I said I think most of them are in a queue. At time of writing, Battlefield community hotspots mostly consist of competitive queue-posting. 'There are 417,000 people ahead of me!' boasts one . 'There are 458,000 ahead of me!' ripostes another . The good news is that queues appear to be moving quick. It's no surprise. I'm not a Battlefield follower and even I've noticed how frenzied the hype for this particular release has been, where other fields of battle have passed me by. People are gagging for it, and I suspect I know why. For one, people—including our FPS cz…",

    "body": "Josh Sawyer has been making games professionally for 26 years. What started as a hobby, making and playing tabletop RPGs, has grown into a storied career. Sawyer had his first position in 1999 working at Black Isle Studios, and now serves as studio design director at Obsidian, where he led development on games like Fallout: New Vegas and Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. And yet, Sawyer believes job security for himself as well as other devs is worse than ever before despite his current position, as well as shipping so many well-respected titles over the years, \"In 26 years, I’ve never really felt secure in a job. Even now. Less so now, actually\", he tells the audience during a keynote at GCAP , a game development conference in Melbourne, Australia. \"That’s actually pretty messed up\" he adds, almost as though he’s realising it upon saying it out loud. The games industry is a vastly different space than it was 26 years ago when Sawyer began. Back then, teams of developers for AAA games were usually between 15-40 people, with almost everyone branching out across different skills and, more often than not, undergoing constant crunch to deliver. Halo: Combat Evolved, for example was a team …",
