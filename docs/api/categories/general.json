That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive. Imagine turning Animal Crossing into a coworking space—that's basically On-Together. It's unabashedly cozy game-core with chibi avatars, a pastel color palette, and little minigames like fishing and basketball.

Omelet You Cook launched to rave reviews from players, and over the past five months it's achieved one of the rarest of Steam milestones: 100% positive reviews. Over 500 reviews, not a single one of them negative. That is until this week, when one cook spoiled the broth with a red thumbs-down among the sea of blue approval. The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews? Just go play the game, it's great!\" But it's especially bold to post a negative review that breaks that lovely 100% positive streak that's been rolling along for months—just for a joke.

As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

Okay, so they're just screen-printed regular Xbox Wireless controllers, available in both regular and Elite flavours, but even I had to raise a smile at the bizarreness of the design.

They're also available to customise as part of the Xbox Design Lab suite, so you can... I don't know, make them look like SpongeBob has a terrible illness? The Elite version seems to be going that way by default, as the outer grips look to be an odd mix of textured black plastic and bile green stamping.

For a niche RPG with a hefty price tag, that's quite the win. That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side. Despite its poor technical performance, however, I absolutely loved my monster-slaying holiday, giving it 89% in my Dragon's Dogma 2 review .

Although it follows the same process of meeting new characters who need your help, completing their quests to unlock them as friends, and clearing up any chaos caused by some force linked to your trauma, Wishblossom Ranch is unlike any of the expansions Disney Dreamlight Valley has released. Each biome you explore is so different from one another, yet the quests that link them and the relationships between the characters you meet pulls them together in an incredibly neat package.

For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together.
