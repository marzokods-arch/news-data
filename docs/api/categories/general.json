British rapper Giggs performed Sunday (Oct. 12) at halftime of the game between the New York Jets and Denver Broncos at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Broncos won 13-11. “It’s a huge moment to be a part of the London Games,” Giggs said. “I’ve been on a journey with my music, and to get to share that with my city and the NFL fans is something I’m really proud of.” The south London native’s 2007 single “Talkin’ da Hardest” remains a popular anthem among his fans. Cleveland Browns players unfamiliar with the song&nbsp; liked what they heard &nbsp;when it was played last week. Giggs has done collaborations with artists including Drake, 21 Savage, Ed Sheeran and Dave. Last week, British singer Raye performed a halftime show at Tottenham with a nearly seven-minute set that included her hit “Where is My Husband!” The Minnesota Vikings beat Cleveland 21-17 in the game. British singer-songwriter Myles Smith was chosen to headline the halftime show at the first-ever regular-season NFL game in Ireland.

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi.

I never thought another pair of buds would take over the Buds Pro 2 this soon, but Google has surprised me with its new Pixel Buds 2a (). I expected these to become a secondary pair of buds I keep at home for short listening sessions, not the buds I take with me everywhere, but they’re so good that I don’t find myself really missing anything about my Pixel Buds Pro 2. And for nearly half the price? It’s a steal, especially for any Pixel user.",

Some of this is expected, such as your Social Security number, home address, and payment details. Beyond that, carriers also enable settings that allow them to collect data from your web browsing, location, and more. While they do not directly access this information themselves, it is used to build advertising profiles and personalize your experience. It is also not just for internal use. The big three carriers share, and in some cases sell, personal information to other companies for targeted ads or credit checks. When you consider the steady stream of high-profile security breaches carriers have faced in recent years, it is understandable if the idea of handing over even more data makes you uneasy.",

Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

That only compounded when it was revealed that it would be one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite gaming handhelds, with the crowdfunding campaign finishing at just over $1 million raised a few days ago. But in the month since the campaign started, very little has been revealed about the device itself. Unlike AYANEO, which typically has a working sample unit before announcing anything to the public, AYN did not appear to have a working prototype. At least, until now.",

From the Kobo Libra Colour to the Boox P6 Pro series, color displays (like Kaleido 3 panels) are on the rise. These models cater to readers who want graphic novels, children’s books, textbooks, and other visually rich content to look the way they were intended. Even menus, app icons, and book covers pop with a little color. Meanwhile, highlights and scribbles (on stylus-supported models) also stand out more vividly, which is likely why Amazon just launched a colorful Kindle Scribe , and reMarkable’s Paper Pro Move now sports a color display too.",

I’m so glad I tried it, as it has added significant utility to my minimalist, productivity-focused home screen. Let me offer a brief tutorial if you aren’t familiar with Edge Panel or have never used a Samsung phone. The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface. These devices offered a gimmicky tapered screen edge where icons were placed, effectively turning the side of the phone’s screen into a secondary display packed with shortcuts.

After relying on Google’s Wear OS for nearly a decade, it is switching to a custom interface to fix connectivity issues with the iPhone. TAG Heuer went a step further, securing a “Made for iPhone” certification for the smartwatch. Google’s Wear OS has been the choice of interface for several generations of TAG Heuer Connected series smartwatches. However, the luxury watchmaker is changing that with the latest generation of the series, replacing Wear OS with a custom operating system that plays well with the iPhone. TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

The issue persists across multiple apps, including third-party ones that utilize Google’s EIS API. Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.
