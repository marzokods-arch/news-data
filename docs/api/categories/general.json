Every December since 2016, Barker has spent the back end of the year scrambling to pull together his homage to famous, infamous and beloved figures we lost that year , all assembled in a giant, overstuffed montage honoring the Beatles iconic cover for their groundbreaking 1967 Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band album. This year&#8217;s effort was one of the most crowded ever, with 245 names on the list, from the expected — Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Reiner, Gene Hackman, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson, wrestler Hulk Hogan and funk innovator Sly Stone — to some quintessentially quirky picks that will resonate with British fans, but might not translate on this side of the pond (Clodagh Rodgers, 1971 Irish Eurovision &#8220;Jack in the Box&#8221; singer).

(Best new artist nominees Addison Rae, Alex Warren and Lola Young charted for the first time in 2024, while The Marías earned their first entry in 2022.) Dean debuted with her breakout single “Man I Need,” which reached the top 10, and followed with four additional entries. KATSEYE arrived in June with “Gnarly” and scored its first top 40 hit in November with “Gabriela.” Sombr hit the top 10 in November with “Back to Friends,” his first chart entry, and continued his momentum…",

One thing that comes across loud and clear is the degree to which sequels and franchises have come to dominate the marketplace.

Star Wars is the top franchise on this recap, with six installments that have been the year’s top-grossing film. Batman is runner-up, with four installments that finished first for the year.
