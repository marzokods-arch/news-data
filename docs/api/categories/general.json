While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field. In a brief preview video , Dwarf Fortress creator Tarn Adams outlined the new siegecraft tactics invaders will employ to break apart and circumvent fortress defenses, forcing players to rethink years of defensive strategy.

Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

On the latter point, gacha and Overwatch gamers need to batten down the hatches because it looks like the political bloc might be coming for your loot boxes. Well, if you're a minor, anyway. An EU committee—the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee—today adopted a report by popular vote that encourages the European Commission (EC) to tackle several harms that minors face online today. The vote to adopt the report passed with \"32 votes in favour, 5 against and with 9 abstentions\". And in addition to proposing a minimum age of 13 for kids to access social media with parental permission, or age 16 without that permission, and some other recommendations, the committee also recommends a loot box ban. The EC should, the committee says, \"ban gambling-like mechanisms such as 'loot boxes' in games accessible to minors.\" That's in addition to several other things, such as banning sites that endanger minors, \"engagement-based recommender algorithms\" for minors, and monetisation or other material incenti…",

Most of your rank and file allies have everyday Tactics jobs to earn enough to feed their families fresh Chocobo drumsticks. Over my decades of obsession with this king of strategy RPGs I’ve created a highly scientific system to compare and contrast each and every job across four critical axes: Style : Any dummy can swing a sword, but I need more than that, I need fashion sense . How color coordinated is the job, and does their fit have real chutzpah, or did their mom dress them right out of the fantasy Gap?

While I enjoyed my time with the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , I'm still not a huge fan of the headset's pastel pink 'quartz' colourway. So, when I heard the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is now available outside of Asia , I was there with my Pokeballs at the ready. Obviously, there are a few key differences to note between the V3 Pro and this pretty purple version of the V2. Besides the kitty ears getting swapped out for the ghostie's wee purple horns, the main difference is that the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is a wired headset. That means a stable, constant connection at the risk of forgetting about the wire all together and potentially dragging your rig behind you when you leave your desk…but what sort of Slowpoke would do that, right?

Though, it wouldn't be unusual for Dreamlight Valley to throw in some curveballs either. It currently seems like \"early 2026\" will bring Lady and the Tramp, as suggested by a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a Parisian street. Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves. Finally, a statue of Phil in a biome that looks a lot like Mythopia, alongside Hercules' sandals suggests that Hercules may be coming in Summer. This is as much as the roadmap reveals, and whoever is arriving in winter is yet to be announced. I can't imagine we'll see any sort of teaser until we are well into next year.

Stop giggling at the back, I know where you were going. Anyway, the myAir.0 OriMouse came to my attention this morning (via PC Watch ). It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing.

All the Halloween favorites from past years are returning, and there are new playlists and modes with boo-sted rewards in celebration of spooky season. Rumors of UFOs and ghost sightings have spread throughout Los Santos, and you can track them down to unlock some sweet Halloween costumes. If you're in the mood for something scarier, then the grisly Slasher playlist is back with a new twist that places you and your crew in the cramped corridors of a haunted submarine. Of course, you'll get increased GTA$ and RP payouts for these activities throughout the month of October. Here's an overview of GTA Online's Halloween Haunts 2025 event.

While I'll admit that last bit isn't often acknowledged by historical consensus, it is the basis for Tears of Metal, an upcoming hack-and-slash roguelike with a playable demo on Steam . It's a dark fantasy Dynasty Warriors following a legion of displaced Scots—a combination I didn't know I was missing, but one I'm happy to report is sick.

It's decked out in thick, sketchy comic book style, with scribbled highlights and streaks of effect accents punctuating the by-the-dozens dismemberment of hapless English footmen.

Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam. That's a whole lotta genres, so in the fill-in quiz below I've given you a full 15 gosh darn minutes to type as many of them as you can. They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

Thanks to the Invasion update coming on October 21, you'll now have to defend yourself against knife-wielding Reagents. If you've spent any amount of time playing already, you've probably already encountered a character that looks exactly like one of your friends. But, upon approaching you, they pulled out a knife and started flailing it in your direction. It's not until they start running the other way that you realise that their gamer tag isn't quite spelt right, and they never responded to your desperate cries asking what they were doing. The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",
