O’Hara first rose to prominence as a cast member on SCTV before becoming a defining presence in films including Beetlejuice , Home Alone , Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and a series of Christopher Guest mockumentaries such as Best in Show and For Your Consideration . In the latter part of her career, she became a cultural icon for a new generation with her Emmy-winning performance as Moira Rose on Schitt’s Creek . Director Martin Scorsese, who worked with O’Hara on his 1985 film After Hours , paid tribute in a statement following the news of her death. “Many people know her from Schitt’s Creek . For many others, it’s the Home Alone pictures or Beetlejuice or the Christopher Guest comedies,” Scorsese said. “For me, and for most of my friends, it’s SCTV .

It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android.

Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users.

    "body": "TL;DR OnePlus’ bypass charging feature now works beyond gaming, letting phones pull power directly from the charger during heavy use to reduce heat and battery wear. More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

Rugged phones are rarely shy about excess, but 8849’s Tank X pushes the envelope. Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games.

And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone of 2025, beating out the flagship Galaxy S25 series. Apple dominated the top four spots globally with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 lineups. Demand for affordable 4G devices remains surprisingly high, as seen in the success of the Galaxy A06 4G, which sold more than any Galaxy S25 series flagship. With all the marketing hype around Android flagships , you’d think that some of them would go on to be best sellers for the year. Take, for instance, the Galaxy S25 series , which launched globally in January 2025, giving it a strong position to emerge as a global top-seller in 2025. As it turns out, the most popular Galaxy phone of 2025 isn’t the Galaxy S25 — it’s not even a flagship at all. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Global sales start on February 12 at $499 for the 12+256 version, or $599 for the 16+512GB version. The gaming phone landscape is looking pretty grim in 2026, with ASUS stepping back from the smartphone market and newer flagship chips suffering from poor thermal performance. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the last gaming phones on the market (and our top pick for the best gaming phone ), but now it’s set to get a cheaper, more pocketable sibling. The REDMAGIC 11 Air is a slightly slimmed-down version of the 11 Pro, but not by much. The company writes that it’s “12% thinner and 10% lighter” than its larger sibling, with the same 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel. It’s still roughly as thick as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at 8mm, but the flat back means there’s no camera bump to get in your way while you game.",

Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show. But coming from the outspoken CEO himself, there’s little room for realignment.",
