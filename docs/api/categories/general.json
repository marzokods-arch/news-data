    "body": "Although Shenseea dominated the night with five wins, including dancehall album, collaboration and song of the year, the third annual Caribbean Music Awards certainly spread the wealth. Hosted by Majah Hype at Brooklyn&#8217;s King Theatre (Aug. 28), this year&#8217;s Caribbean Music Awards honored performers and works across reggae, dancehall, soca, R&amp;B, gospel, bouyon, zess-steam, konpa and more, highlighting the myriad styles that have helped Caribbean music and culture remain a global force. Thanks to his collaborations with Shenseea (&#8220;Hit &amp; Run&#8221;) and Romain Virgo (&#8220;Been There Before&#8221;), Masicka was the second most-awarded artist of the night with four trophies. Nearly every artist who earned at least three nominations took home something, except for Nailah Blackman, Chronic Law, Kranium, Bunji Garlin, Problem Child, Trinidad Killa and Jada Kingdom — all of whom were completely shut out. Notably, all three of last year&#8217;s female artist of the year winners repeated in their respective categories, with Shenseea taking home the dancehall honor, Lila Iké snagging the reggae award and Patrice Roberts winning the soca trophy for a third consecutiv…",

The Aug. 28 ceremony, which unfolded at Brooklyn&#8217;s Kings Theater ahead of a BET telecast on Sept. 12, celebrated the biggest artists and buzziest records across Caribbean music over the past year, with over 40 categories honoring genres like reggae, dancehall, soca, zess-steam, konpa, calypso, gospel and R&amp;B. Shenseea , who tied Masicka as this year&#8217;s most-nominated artist (seven apiece), was the night&#8217;s biggest winner, with five victories, including dancehall album, song and collaboration of the year.
