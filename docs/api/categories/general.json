Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference.

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

Introduced in Android 13, this feature tints app icons to match the system theme, creating a more visually cohesive look. Unfortunately, it relies on developers providing monochromatic versions of their icons. Since many developers haven’t done so, users are often left with a hodgepodge of themed and unthemed icons when the feature is turned on.",

Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google has published the December 2025 Security Bulletin, revealing a long list of severe vulnerabilities in Android. These issues are expected to be patched with device-specific security updates dated December 05. The list includes a few critical vulnerabilities in the Android Framework and at the system level. Google has just released the Android Security Bulletin for December 2025, with a roster of all vulnerabilities that affect Android devices. Unlike the frequent Pixel (or manufacturer-specific) security updates , this bulletin lists all potential vulnerabilities that impact Android devices. These vulnerabilities, affecting Android 13 or later, will be patched in the Android security update dated December 05, 2025, and delivered to your devices when the manufacturer releases the security update .",

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.
