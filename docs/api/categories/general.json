The annual broadcast, returning Dec. 31 beginning at 8 p.m. ET, sees Ryan Seacrest return to lead the Times Square broadcast alongside Rita Ora, who is back for her second consecutive year helping count down the iconic New York ball drop. This year’s telecast will once again span several U.S. cities. Chance the Rapper will host from his hometown of Chicago, where he’ll guide the Central Time Zone countdown from the city’s live celebration. In Las Vegas, the show pairs NFL legend Rob Gronkowski with performer and presenter Julianne Hough, who makes her Rockin’ Eve co-hosting debut. Details for the Puerto Rico broadcast are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The multi-city structure has become a hallmark of the franchise, allowing the special to cross between stages, countdowns and performances across multiple time zones. It’s also one of ABC’s most durable draws: last year’s edition drew more than 29 million total viewers at midnight, buoyed by performances from Carrie Underwood, Sabrina Carpenter, Lenny Kra…",

Eilish shared the announcement in a video posted to Instagram following the San Francisco show, paired with a new image featuring her and Cameron, shot by photographer Henry Hwu.

    "body": "&nbsp; Ball Park Music are getting another boost from their career-defining support slot on Oasis’ blockbuster Australian reunion tour, with the Brisbane five-piece featured in the latest instalment of Live Nation’s Soundcheck series. The behind-the-scenes episode documents the band stepping onto the biggest stages of their career, performing to stadium-sized crowds across the country as Oasis returned to Australian venues for the first time in more than a decade. The new video follows Ball Park Music from soundcheck through to showtime, capturing the emotional and technical build-up before the house lights drop. The band — who have long cited Oasis as formative influences — are shown tuning up backstage, taking in the scale of the stadium, and reflecting on the surreal nature of opening for one of the most culturally dominant bands of the ’90s and 2000s. View this post on Instagram “It’s hard to even describe what it feels like to open for Oasis,” the band say in the episode. “We’ve all grown up with their music and to suddenly be standing there, playing before them, it’s surreal. You can feel the crowd buzzing from the moment you walk out. It’s a mix of nerves and pure joy. Nigh…",

    "body": "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere has received mixed reviews from critics, and has gotten off to a slower-than-expected start at the boxoffice, but as of Sunday (Nov. 23) it has grossed $42.8 million worldwide, according to boxofficemojo.com . That puts it at No. 20 on Billboard ‘s list of music biopics with the highest worldwide grosses. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.) But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the hi…",
