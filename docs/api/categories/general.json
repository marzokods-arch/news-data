The only bummer is that early pets aren't very strong, but upgrading the flute turns the instrument into a real game changer. Some classes start with a taming advantage (and the Beastmaster even ranks quite high in my 99 Nights in the Forest class tier list ), but the flute is available to everyone regardless of role. Every upgrade unlocks new animals to befriend too, so instead of squishy bunnies, you can roll up on the Cultist Stronghold with a Mammoth.

Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities.

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.

I'm a stimm-hopped gunslinger sprinting and sliding at 30mph as I splatter the walls with heretic brains. Let me explain: Darktide 's new Hive Scum class is rather good. Or at least, it was rather good. It's still pretty good, but in the preview build I played (before Fatshark understandably nerfed its ranged capabilities) it was hands-down the best ranged class in the game, power-creeping Veterans so hard that Creed was likely spinning in his grave, or whatever mint-condition packaging Trazyn put him in. Though the Hive Scum gains enhanced dodges, melee immunity while sliding, and complete immunity on ranged critical hits, the real crux of the matter lies with a single ability—Enhanced Desperado. This lets your scum enter a state where they are immune to all ranged attacks, gain faster sprint speed, and don't use ammo when reloadi…",

Could that—even, should that—model apply to the Steam Machine? The publishing director of Larian Studios, the outfit behind Baldur's Gate 3 among other high-profile games, clearly thinks so. I know subsidising hardware is unfashionable now but surely they're losing far more than a ~200$ difference by not having people on the storefront, which is essentially a money printing machine.

Spotted by MP1st , the European trademark filing wasn't made by Remedy but by a company called Nordia Law, a law firm with offices in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, where Remedy is based. But Nordia does have a history with Remedy: It provided legal advice to the studio in its Control 2 contract negotiations with 505 Games, for instance, (a deal that has since been undone ) and also assisted in negotiating financing deals with Tencent and Annapurna . So there's some real history there. It's no secret that a Control sequel is in development: Remedy said so back in 2022. Whether Control Resonant is that sequel is an open question, however. The trademark filing covers a lot of ground, from \"computer gaming software\" to \"printed matter\" like books and magazines, television shows, movies, music, clothing, and even, for some reason, \"lanyards for holding keys.\" It's pretty broad, in other words, and the title could be a reference to something other than a new …",

Eight years ago, a video titled \"Why I don't play video games anymore\" was uploaded to the PewDiePie channel, explaining the reasons behind the lack of Let's Play videos. Since then, his channel has adapted into more lifestyle blogging and the occasional hobby vlog. Of course, there are a few games sprinkled in, with the most recent video featuring Geoguessr.

This was with a turnover of nearly $82 million (70.7 million euros), leaving the company with more debt than equity. The future of its Peripherals division is also uncertain, and that's why it's hard to predict what will even happen to these keyboards in the future. According to Heise , Cherry is considering selling either its Peripherals division, which includes all its keyboards and mice, or the Digital Health & Solutions division. Cherry dabbles in both the gaming and the office peripheral market, and both of those fall under that general \"peripherals\" umbrella. In fact, the company seems to have had big plans for the gaming market in the recent past, having taken over gaming peripheral company Xtrfy in 2022. Now, the entire division might be sold off again.

    "body": "We learned last week that the realm of Fortnite, the real 'everything app,' will be expanding its borders even further through the adoption of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill—specifically an \"unfilmed scene\" entitled The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge . A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer. The first thing I noticed in the teaser is a change to the Pussy Wa…",

It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing.

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

So far, Sega's only said it's getting delisted on Steam, and I'm not sure if that will also apply to other storefronts. I've reached out to Sega to ask about this, and will update if I hear back. You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price.
