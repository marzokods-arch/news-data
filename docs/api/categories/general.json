We love talking about innovative cases, even if they’re not necessarily Android phone cases, like this one. A company called Dockcase has made a phone case that comes with an unusual advantage — a secondary display for selfie previews.

New screenshots get saved automatically on the phone’s local storage. A new screenshot no longer dismisses the previous one, so you can finally take bulk screenshots without losing them. I never thought the day would come, but after more than four years, Google has finally rolled out an update to the Pixel Watch companion app on Android that fixes the horrendous way it manages screenshots coming from the watch. Every silly issue we used to have while taking watch screenshots is now gone, and you can finally take multiple shots in a row without stopping to save or share each one and without them vanishing.

Portable gaming hardware keeps getting more and more powerful, and the aptly-named Super X is here to bring desktop-level power to a two-in-one tablet design. It isn’t cheap, but it blows traditional devices like the Surface Pro out of the water. The OneXPlayer Super X packs up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 128GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful devices you can buy. It’s far from the only device with this chipset, but its killer feature is that it can transform between a tablet and a laptop. There’s a kickstand in the back, which, paired with the magnetic keyboard included with early bird purchases, turns it into a real portable powerhouse.",

The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

With the Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has finally delivered on the original promise of foldable phones : a device that truly transforms from a phone into a tablet. When folded, you interact with a standard 6.5-inch cover display, but unfolding it reveals a massive 10-inch screen. The inner display is so large, in fact, that the software treats it like a tablet, even enabling standalone Samsung DeX directly on the device. But the TriFold’s utility doesn’t end there: it can also function as a secondary monitor for your PC. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade.

That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home .

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is changing how RAW images are handled on the web. When you click edit, you’ll have two options: Edit with Google Photos or download the RAW file. Choosing to edit with Photos will convert the photo into a JPEG. RAW not only allows you to capture the highest quality photos, but the format also gives you greater editing flexibility. However, these benefits come at a cost, and that cost is space. RAW images have an enormous file size compared to JPEGs, and not every photo editor can handle them, including Google Photos. But now Google Photos on the web will give you two options for how to deal with these types of files. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Found under Bluetooth settings, the “Game Controller settings” page allows users to customize inputs for both buttons (“Keys”) and directional sticks (“Axes”). The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete. Thanks to a recent Canary release, however, I’m now able to demo what the UI for Android’s game controller remapping feature looks like.
