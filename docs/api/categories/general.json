Now Samsung appears to be working on its own version for One UI 8.5 called “Now nudges.” Nudges would function very similarly to Magic Cue, finding information for when you need it and suggesting next actions. How does the adage go? Good artists copy, great artists steal? We certainly see enough of that kind of behavior in the smartphone world, and everything from elements of phone design to software features finds itself constantly appropriated. This year, Pixel 10 owners have been getting to know Magic Cue , and while it’s been slow to grow on some of us, we’re finally starting to really appreciate its appeal .

The Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 are two of the most powerful Android phone processors on the market. These chips can run even the most demanding games, but one issue is that they don’t play nicely with bleeding-edge emulators .

We also see three new foldables, including what appears to be the Z Flip 8 FE. Are there any big secrets left in smartphones anymore? Sure, lots of companies go through the routine of refreshing the same series of models, year after year, but even when someone decides to mix things up — like Samsung did with the S25 Edge this year (and like it’s about to do with again the TriFold ) — we often hear about these phones months and months before they ever go official. Still, we love chasing down all the details on that hardware we can, and today we’re sharing some new insight into Samsung’s 2026 plans. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo.

    "body": "TL;DR Holidays come with traffic, but Google Maps is helping you avoid it by revealing the busiest — and least busy — times to run your errands. You can find the best and worst days and times to shop based on your US state, giving you the inside scoop on holiday prep. The secret is to run errands on Tuesday afternoons, as that’s when shops and post offices are often less crowded. The holidays bring time off work and connection with friends and family, but they also come with travel, traffic, and plenty of errands. Thanksgiving is the most-traveled holiday in the US, with over 80 million people expected to hit the roads, board trains, and fly on planes this coming week. After that, December holidays lead right into the new year. To help you ace your holiday travel and preparations, Google is sharing a few tips based on Google Maps data to save you time while avoiding traffic. Thanksgiving is first, so let’s start there. Traffic is 14% more congested than usual between 10 AM and 4 PM the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which falls on November 27 this year. You should try to avoid traveling on that Wednesday between 1 PM and 3 PM, since that two-hour window is when roads are most crow…",

The Translate app may gain a persistent notification, allowing you to continue using Live Translate even if you switch to a different app. Google also appears to be prepping for Live Translate on XR glasses. In August, Google rolled out an update to the Translate app that introduced Live Translation. Powered by Gemini, this feature allows you to have a real-time back-and-forth conversation with others in a different language. Not only are your words converted into another language on screen, but you can also turn on audio playback to hear the translation spoken out loud. In our APK teardown of the Google Translate app, we discovered that several interesting changes are likely to be introduced to this Live Translate feature.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",
