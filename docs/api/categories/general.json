Their live show, by contrast, feels like a controlled explosion: color, motion, joy, chaos and grace fused into something communal and deeply emotional. For Yates, the challenge of the band’s Never Enough era hasn’t been figuring out how to scale up — it’s figuring out how to grow without losing the band’s DIY spirit. “Festivals and big shows can swallow you whole,” Yates says. “But our goal is always to make something intimate, even if it’s 13,000 people spread out in a field.

When I say quietly, I mean extremely quietly: He’s never done a major interview – he’s rarely even shown his face in his music videos, all while his minimalist dark R&amp;B has accumulated hundreds of thousands of streams. His granulated vocals drift between confession and confrontation; his production leans light, but never fragile. It’s a mix that has earned him a fiercely committed fan base and a reputation as a perfectionist who releases new material only when the work feels undeniable. It’s true that TikTok and virality have partially aided in Lithe’s gradual yet consistent rise — his song “Fall Back” took the app by storm last year — but the larger part of his motion remains a mystery, and that impending fame has been admittedly stressful for him. “Everything just gets flipped upside down,” Lithe tells Billboard of fame and virality. “Your whole life gets flipped upside down.

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

Generic red dots are replaced by emoji-style pins and detailed cards featuring photos, star ratings, and review highlights. The visual overhaul is currently rolling out to English users on both the mobile and desktop versions of Gemini. Google’s Gemini app just got a big update for anything related to location, and it’s making it easier to find places that matter to you. Now, instead of a plain text list with a small map at the bottom, your local search results start with visuals and context inside Gemini . If you’ve ever asked Gemini, “Where’s a good coffee spot nearby?” and had to scroll through lots of text before opening Google Maps , this update aims to fix that. Now, the first thing you see is a map, followed by cards for each place with photos, star ratings, and highlights from reviews, the Gemini team confirmed on X . Android Authority first spotted this feature earlier this month, along with a ChatGPT-inspired redesign to Gemini’s tool menu .",

For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

With Gemini enhancing a wide range of modern Google apps , there’s no reason the classic favorites should stay behind. This is why Google is now announcing new improvements based on Gemini to one of its headlining apps, Translate. Google has today announced new upgrades to Translate, powered by enhanced Gemini models. Google doesn’t specify which newer models, but we believe it is referring to the recently announced Gemini 3 and 3 Pro . With this improvement, Translate (and related functionality in Search) will be able to offer more nuanced, natural translations of slang, idioms, and other complex figures of speech.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.

It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",
