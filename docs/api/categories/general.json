The Echo Aviation Controller is specifically geared towards playing flight simulators on PC, and is already readying for a mid-December 2025 takeoff. Rather than saddling yourself with heaps of specialist hardware, this pad attempts to, according to the press release, “cram a cockpit into a controller.” Perhaps a gift idea for the geek in your life that got really into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ? I mean, all that functionality scrunched up into a gamepad footprint does make the Echo Aviation Controller look like an arcane instrument. However, all those improbably placed knobs and dials allow players to simultaneously control the “pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, trim and core aircraft systems.” Talk about a packed flight. Pitch and roll is tied to the precision thumbstick, allowing you to finetune full elevator and aileron inputs. There are also four integrated Throttle Levers plus a Trim Wheel, and all of th…",

I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice.

The trailer showcases the Hive Scum's crowbar, one of the class' improvised melee weapons (they can also swing a saw), as well as their dual-wielded guns. For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins.

Nobody thinks the lady with the big deadly sword is a healer, but they also can't figure out if she's going to be a tank or a damage-dealer. Usually, Blizzard makes it pretty clear how a character will play in the game, even if their reveal cinematic is mostly focused on their backstory and isn't captured in-game. Vendetta's video is a tricky case because we see her cut apart a robot—pretty damaging by any measure—but also block its shots with her gigantic sword almost like a tank would. That's not unprecedented: Overwatch already has tank heroes, like Junker Queen, who could easily be mistaken for damage-dealers because they don't carry around a big shield like Reinhardt. It doesn't help that Blizzard hasn't clarified what role Vendetta will be in the video's description or on social media, leaving it to fans to try to suss out the answer. But here's the thing: Blizzard, or at least a PR agency representing it, already confirmed Vendetta's role in an email to press right after the trailer went out. PC Gamer, along w…",

Historically, scrap has been pretty easy to get, and its abundance throughout the map made crafting upgraded workbenches easy. Playing it safe and farming scrap around your base meant fewer people out in the world for PvP, but the strategy worked. As a solo player, I could visit monuments to find a little treat, but I didn't need to venture into the wild as soon as possible. The update largely reduces scrap cost, but tacks on a new material requirement with two types of Blueprint Fragments.

On the other, there are now six Magic cards of Dwight Schrute from the Office—a truth with a terrible psychic weight. Magic: The Gathering's next Secret Lair collaboration, however, makes so much intuitive sense that it might as well have been fated since Wizards of the Coast inked its first crossover contract. Magic's premier stable of megafauna artists have taken a crack at Monster Hunter, and the results are as excellent as you'd expect. (Image credit: Wizards of the Coast) Announced earlier today, the Secret Lair: Monster Hunter superdrop will land on December 1, bringing four sets of Magic cards reimagined with Monster Hunter theming in non-foil and foil bundles at costs of up to an inadvisable $560. And considering that MtG's artists have produced some of the coolest dinosaurs and dragons to ever grace bits of cardboard, it should come as no surprise that they've done some excellent adaptive work with Capcom's beloved creature designs.

Project Misriah: Halo Ports, a collection of Counter-Strike 2 custom maps that recreate classic Halo 3 multiplayer in Valve's freshly rebooted FPS, is so good that it's frustrating. Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines.

Well, they said it was a lot of stuff to do with the endings and your choices across the series not mattering that much. I know better, though. In their heart of hearts, in the deep, festering reaches of their collective subconscious, the gamers yearned for the lifts. The first Mass Effect was beloved.

Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause.

    "body": "Overwatch 2 has finally confirmed who Hero 45 is going to be, and the statue in Stadium's Colosseo map was right: the next hero will be a female gladiator called Vendetta who goes by the name of La Lupa, The Wolf. Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this. But the most interesting aspect of this hero was her brief flashback midway through the reveal …",

As spotted by CityAM , Ubisoft's given a stormy-cloud financial warning that its \"physical software sales in the UK market\" are going to see a decline next year, and that it expects a dip in revenue. That's because, as the document states, \"The traditional 'full game' model of selling a single £50-£60 game to a consumer as a one-time purchase continues to become less ubiquitous.\" The warning then goes on to peer into its crystal ball and determines that: \"Multi Game Subscription services, long-running Games As A Service titles, Free To Play games and Cloud Streaming offerings all [provide] new and attractive ways for consumers to access gaming content. \"Consumers are playing fewer games, playing them for longer, and as a result, outside of a few notable exceptions, many new games are struggling to stand out and achieve the sales they may…",

So it's good news for a bunch of handheld gamers that Asus has just released a big batch update for the three handhelds, plus the oft-forgotten ROG Xbox Ally (non-X). And when I say a 'big' batch update, I mean a BIG one, at least if Asus' announcement post on X is anything to go by: \"Everyone! This is a BIG week for updates on the ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, ROG Xbox Ally, and ROG Xbox Ally X! A new Armoury Crate SE update is on the way, bringing expanded CPU and power controls, stability upgrades, and a series of fixes and improvements across both devices.\" I'm not sure what \"both\" refers to, given the company lists four devices, not two, but what I can say is the most exciting updates are for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The latter gets 'P-core' and 'E-core' options in the Armoury Crate SE software. Note that 'core' is all lowercase there, because 'P-Cores' and 'E-Cores' refer to Intel cores. AMD has its own v…",

    "body": "OLED PC monitor sales are on the up, according to data outfit Trendforce . Compared to last year, sales are up by fully 65%. That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures. OLED TVs still make monitors seem pricey. (Ima…",

I'd prefer just to use one mouse for everything, but I've yet to find one that suits all my needs and preferences, all of the time. Most of that comes down to feel and fit. The Viper is great for gaming, but I often prefer to have something more substantial in hand for work, which is where the Pro Click comes in. There isn't a mouse around that's capable of being both whenever I want it to, but the Orbital Pathfinder is certainly on the path to being that mouse, thanks to its wealth of customization options. Which is why we've just added such a category to our best gaming mouse guide , and until something better comes along, the Pathfinder is our top recommendation for the best customizable gaming mouse.

On that front, Valve explains that the company's upcoming machine is actually \"equal or better\" than 70% of Steam gamers' systems. Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. So that's also another way to, kind of, think about where we kind of arrived at that performance level [that they targeted]\" (via Notebookcheck ).

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.
