I've played with some of the tools on the Midnight alpha build and they're already surprisingly robust. You can drop tables and paintings and chandeliers just about anywhere, and every object can be rotated and resized easily. Walls and floors can be reskinned with a few clicks and it'll even remember your most recent choices for when you add new preset rooms to your pad. Housing will require owning Midnight when it fully drops, but this is your opportunity to try it for free. WoW PTRs don't require a subscription; lapsed accounts can download it on the Battle.net launcher as soon as it's live. Completely new players, however, will need to make a PTR account following the steps on Blizzard's website . In her preview of WoW: Midnight's alpha …",

It turns out that an application on Steam can't be both a mod, which Team Fortress 2 Classic is, and a demo, which it was about to be, at the same time. You might think somebody would have flagged this ahead of time but, well, no. \"Unfortunately, this was not caught by anyone at Eminoma or at Valve until last Saturday, after initial reviews hadn't flagged it as an issue and gave us the mistaken belief that we were clear to ship,\" the dev team wrote. The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change—specifically, the name of the mod.

This time around, he's even crediting it with inspiring Metal Gear and Death Stranding. Expo '70 was organised around the theme of \"Progress and Harmony for Mankind\", and featured participation from 76 countries and 32 organisations. It had a theme song, Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from all over the world), which Kojima is a little obsessive about: the song repeats the \"hello\" refrain many times as well as talking about humanity \"holding hands\" across borders. It's actually a bit of a bop . \"When the Expo opened, I had just finished elementary school,\" writes Kojima . \"I was able to visit the site many times. I went there dozens of times [...] At the Soviet Pavilion, I waited in line for over two hours, with a line stretching around the perimeter.

On the Battlefield subreddit , the Steam discussion forums , and on X , users who bought Battlefield 6 from EA's launcher say that after launching the game—and sitting through the launch day login queue—they're unable to play either multiplayer or the campaign. Even after multiple reinstall attempts, Battlefield 6 will insist that those users are \"missing\" necessary content, or that they must \"purchase to play\"—seemingly indicating that the EA app isn't correctly recognizing the software license for users who purchased BF6 through EA's own software. \"I've got warned about purchasing the game via the EAL, but I tried staying true to the bone, since I already have every other BF I ever bought on there,\" one redditor said . \"And now I have spent 1 hour in a menu/shooting range.

Battlefield 6 is checking both of those boxes at launch with Portal, a web tool and SDK that lets people fire up persistent custom games and create new game modes. There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them. That means right now, you can hop in a Shipment 24/7 playlist (which already exists) and enjoy a mode that Call of Duty players usually have to beg …",

Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

Okay, to be fair, Timmins wasn't quite as foreboding as that, but he did caution players against using this (or any other) dialogue skipping mod when they brought it to his attention. Not because he's precious about you hearing his game's lovely words, but because \"skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable.\" Turns out all that nattering is holding something up, and that something is important. While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\".

It's got a blazingly fast 947RPM fire rate, making it one of the fastest-firing weapons in the game, and yet it has virtually no recoil. Seriously. The best BF6 PW7A2 loadout takes advantage of this to create a flanking menace. While SMGs like the SGX and even the PW5A3 are capable of some pretty extraordinary feats at range, they pale in comparison to the PW7A2. Despite lower per-bullet damage, its significantly higher fire rate and unmatched handling more than make up for it. So, here's what you need.

The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending. If you're using an LMG as Support (which you should be), you'll also get additional bonuses to ADS and sprint speed, helping to make things a tad more competitive.

When combined with a frustratingly small 20-round magazine, it's hard to consistently score kills at range or multi-kills. The M277's stock attachments look very cool and tactical, but it's not all that optimal to have a suppressor and large optic on a weapon with so much kick and so few bullets. So, here's what you need to do.

It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way.

The best BF6 SGX loadout might make it look rather silly, but you can't argue with the performance. The SGX is described as aggressive and close-range with a high fire rate, and that's certainly true, but it's more reliable than it implies.

First things first: You may be thinking that this is not an anniversary of any sort for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which came out on December 9, 2024. And you would be correct. But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you—as long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits. The update will also add a new \"Cairo outfit,\" enabling Indy to travel the blistering heat of the d…",

There just aren't that many left that haven't already been used. It's not great news for us, either. What the hell else am I supposed to do for a few minutes every morning: exercise, enrich myself with literature, or have a conversation with a loved one? At least there's a little brightness in our grim future. Fast-forward from 2027 to the year 2077, and it looks like we'll still be able to play a bit of Wordle between our visits to the ripperdoc for some new chrome. It's all thanks to a mod by MisterChedda called Gonkle for Cyberpunk 2077 ( via RPS ), which gives you a suspiciously Wordle-like word game for you to play on your in-game phone. And even better, it's not so strict on the words you can use, fully embracing all that gritty and silly Night City slang. Choom isn't just a cool thing to call your buddy, it's also an answer in Gonkle. \"Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone—same word for…",

Instead of rolling out this year as planned, Unfrozen and Hooded Horse now say the game will arrive sometime in 2026. This is actually the second time HOMM: Olden Era has been delayed. It was originally set to launch in the second quarter of 2025, but developers said in June—very near the end of that release target—that they were postponing to later in the year , \"to ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves.\" As it turns out, that wasn't quite enough time to get things done, as the team now says it wants to \"conduct more tests, improve the UI, and redesign some of the units,\" which is going to push it out into 2026. The good news amidst the bad is that a demo for HOMM: Olden Era is now available on Steam , offering players access to the game's tutorial and three different singleplayer modes, using four \"very different factions\" of the six planned for the early access release. There's no time limit on the demo, so you can play as much as you like. \"We'd love to hear your thoughts after tr…",

In fact, it was just a week later that Warner Bros Pictures co-chairman and CEO Mike De Luca confirmed that a deal was being done . Well, now it's official, and not only that, we've got a date too: A Minecraft Movie 2, or whatever it ends up being called, is set to hit screens on July 23, 2027. (Image credit: Warner Bros.) A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess is returning for the sequel, according to a Deadline report, which is nice because he said he wanted to , and will also co-write the script along with Chris Galletta, one of the screenwriters on the first film. A cast hasn't been announced, but Jason Momoa, who was outfitted in some interesting wardrobe choices in A Minecraft Movie, is listed as one of the executive producers on the sequel, so I would expect he'll return.
