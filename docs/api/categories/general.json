It has a new cross-emulator save management feature and an integrated mod downloader. These major features are PC-only for now, but all platforms have updates and bug fixes. It’s only been a week since Eden improved Nintendo Switch emulation on Android in its latest update, but now the other major alternative has pushed brand new features to PC. Citron’s “Pathfinder” update dropped over the weekend, and although it’s mostly focused on PC and Steam Deck performance, it has bug fixes and updates across all platforms. One of the biggest and most unique new features in the update is save management. This allows you to choose where your save games live, back them up, import them, and even use them in other Switch emulators like Eden or old-school Yuzu. This can be set globally or on a per-game basis.",

With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android.

Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users.

The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

While that update is still rolling out to users, Google appears to be testing a new set of changes to the navigation bar, making it easier to browse content across different apps. According to Reddit user Jodath79 (via 9to5Google ), the Google TV interface is getting two new tabs on the top navigation bar. These new tabs, placed between the Live and Apps tabs, are designed to search for “Free” and “Paid” content across apps installed on the Google TV.",

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).
