That's right, peeps, when Intel's next-gen CPU architecture arrives at the end of 2026, Intel will ascend to a leadership position across the board on desktop. To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on . Unsurprisingly, Pitzer is bullish on 18A, too. He says Intel is planning to spend heavily on tooling up to produce lots of chips on 18A and return Intel t…",

There's a bunch more robot enemies in this arena, and I saw some ammo up on the wallrun I could reach while I wait for the core-yanking ability to come back online. This is a fairly typical five seconds of Metal Eden, a superspeed neon FPS where you're a parkour android with a big bag of tools for movement and for destruction.

A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover.

But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays.

    "body": "The arrival of Hollow Knight: Silksong and Borderlands 4 marks the end of this year's summer doldrums, a period from around April through the end of August when the rate of big-budget and highly-anticipated mainstream game releases is at its lowest. Lots of great games still release during this period, but the kinds of games that top Steam's wishlist chart tend to cluster at the beginning and end of the year, especially in February and October. This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21. The fewest $51+ games released in April, May, and July, with just seven in each of those months over the four-year span under examination. The dark mon…",

Jorjani was replying on Discord to a player asking for \"a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny.)\" Don't hold your breath: \"It's on the feature list for the next one,\" said Jorjani in response.

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

Battlefield 2042 is by no means the most beloved game in the series, but it is the latest instalment and therefore has the most recent content and regular updates. But to entice players to give it another chance, DICE added a 'Road to Battlefield 6' battle pass, which is full of cosmetics that will carry over to Battlefield 6 on launch.

I love it. I'd be sold on looks alone, but having gotten to play a section of Flask at Gamescom last month, I'm convinced there's a really solid roguelike here too. As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage.

Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one. The obvious question to ask here is 'why?' and that's an easy one to answer. Naya Create specs (Image cr…",

In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021.

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing, soon it will be Hornet's daaaay. Sorry. It was just in there . Blame Dean Martin! But now we can get on with it: here's where to find Silver Bells in Silksong to complete the Silver Bells wish. Silver Bells locations in Silksong (Image credit: Team Cherry) Once you've defeated the Silksong Widow boss and freed the town of Bellhart, you can find a wish board next to the town shopkeeper with several quests awaiting you. Accept the Silver Bells quest and then enter the Bellhart Bellway fast travel station. At the bottom of the station, instead of heading left to where you call the Bellbeast, head to the right and break the secret wall to enter the lower bellvein, a claustrophobic sequence of tunnels below the town. Here you'll find the crotchety Bell Hermit who doesn't have much to say; to his right is a narrow shaft that you can ascend using you…",

    "body": "FOV 90 (Image credit: Future) Welcome to FOV 90, an FPS column from staff writer Morgan Park. Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. I can't think of a better way to kick off an FPS column than to gush about one of the best historical features of the genre, the server browser, while also lamenting its near extinction. It feels like shooters are ready for a shake up, but at least in this instance, I think publishers ought to look toward the past to guide them. Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting . Server browsers were a boon for variety, but as we've learned in the years since their disappearance, they were also crucial tools of preservation. In an age of normalized multiplayer decay where you can't count on your new favorite shooter sticking around for even…",

    "body": "Up front: Silksong is obviously a good videogame. I’ve played it for around 15 hours in the last four days, and all the while I’ve watched online communities grapple with it, most of whom seem to have progressed further than me. I’ve spent at least half as many hours reading about Silksong these past few days as I have playing it. And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",
