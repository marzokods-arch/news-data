    "body": "ENHYPEN promised THE SIN : VANISH , and ENHYPEN delivered. The K-pop outfit’s seventh mini-album arrives at the stroke of midnight, one full month after its announcement, as the followup to June 2025’s sixth mini album DESIRE : UNLEASH . According to a statement, the new release marks the group’s “most immersive and narratively driven chapter to date,” a concept album that specifically takes a big bite into vampire mythology. “The album follows an unprecedented escape of vampire lovers, tracing the fragile balance between desire and consequence in a world bound by unbreakable rules,” reads the release. This is no ordinary collection of works from JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO and NI-KI. From start to finish, the 11-track collection blends music, narration, and cinematic storytelling, with songs meshed with narration and skits. It’s presented in the style of a reporter discussing a vampire escape case, and presented in four languages: Korean (voiced by actor Park Jeong Min), English, Japanese (voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda), and Chinese (voiced by singer Lars Huang).

The road to the superstar’s 13th studio album has already been full of twists and turns. First announced last May, the record was slated for release Oct. 10, though was then pushed back to Feb. 6 due to “scheduling issues.” At an i ntimate show at London’s Dingwalls venue Oct. 9, Williams admitted that this was actually due to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination. “We’re all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f–king is &#8212; you can’t compete with that,” Williams said on stage. “I was worried about making [fans] all wait for the record. But then I was like, ‘F–k it.’ I’m sorry, but I’m f–king being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most No. 1 albums the U.K. has f–king ever had?” It was a shrewd decision: Swift’s record remained atop the summit of the U.K.&#8217;s Official Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks upon release.
