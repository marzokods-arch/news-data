    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Leaked specs show Apple’s upcoming iPhones introducing cutting-edge features such as a new A20 Pro chip made with a 2nm process, under-display Face ID on the left edge of the screen, variable-aperture cameras, and potential support for satellite-based 5G. Meanwhile, Samsung appears to be releasing only minor upgrades for its upcoming Galaxy S26 series, as rivals significantly innovate — raising concerns about its competitiveness. Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September. Now, specs for all these upcoming iPhones have leaked again, and it’s not looking great for Samsung unless it pulls up its socks. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The company still hasn’t revealed pricing or a release date, but it should be coming soon. The retro gaming handheld space has grown exponentially over the past few years, but if there’s one newcomer to keep an eye on, it’s MANGMI. The company’s first handheld, the AIR X , was a fantastic budget device, and today it revealed the full spec sheet for its sophomore effort, the Pocket Max. Previous announcements have already revealed that the Pocket Max will feature a Snapdragon 865 SoC, paired with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage. That would have been a flagship gaming handheld back in 2023, but nowadays it places it firmly in the mid-range category.",

I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions.

And if it does, then Google might have finally figured out how to fix one of the Pixel’s biggest battery complaints.",

Yes, there was the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 3x 50MP camera, and a great screen. But the phone got extremely hot under heavy load, the 8MP ultrawide shooter was disappointing, and the lack of wireless charging was notable for the €1,000 recommended price. If anything, the OnePlus 13 shone a harsh light on the GT7 Pro. Between its versatile cameras, impressive performance, great screen, and premium extras, it was clear that OnePlus had the more well-rounded package. Now, realme is back with the realme GT8 Pro. And it turns out the new phone has a lot in common with the OnePlus 15 . In fact, this seems like the OnePlus 15 from a parallel universe.",

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar just dropped its first stable update in five months, Release 2124. It’s the emulator’s biggest update yet, with many improvements across platforms. One of the most significant changes finally reduces input latency on Android devices. Nintendo 3DS emulation has seen a major resurgence in interest with dual-screen gaming handhelds like the AYN Thor and Pocket DS coming out, but its best emulator hasn’t seen a new stable release in five months. Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency. Previous versions had Vsync enabled by default as a way to reduce screen tearing in games. However, Android has its own frame pacing feature that performs a similar function. It has now been disabled by default, with the code around it cleaned up and consolidated.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

You get 250GB of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and the plan includes 30GB of high-speed data usable in Canada, Mexico, and over 215 international destinations. In a bold move aimed squarely at poaching customers from Verizon and AT&amp;T, T-Mobile has launched its new Better Value Plan , offering strong benefits for people who use a lot of data and those who travel internationally.
