A Google support page confirms the feature is only available on the Pixel 8 Pro and newer, leaving out owners of older UWB-equipped Pixels. The exact technical reason for this incompatibility is unclear, as the hardware specifications for the older models don’t fully explain the omission. Choosing the right Bluetooth tracker can be challenging, but if you want to take advantage of your Android phone’s UWB hardware for precision finding, the choice is simple: the Moto Tag. It’s currently the only UWB-equipped tracker that works with Android, allowing you to precisely pinpoint its location from the Find Hub app. However, since most Android phones lack UWB, very few devices can use the Moto Tag’s best feature. The technology is only available on select devices in Motorola’s Edge and Razr lines, Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S and Z series, and Google’s Pixel phones.",

But a few months ago, as his birthday was approaching, I decided to break this unspoken rule and buy him an Android gaming handheld, the Retroid Pocket Classic (). Here’s why I made that choice and why it turned out to be the most perfect and fun gift I could’ve ever given him. Why a portable gaming device seemed like the perfect gift",

Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector.

Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases. The good news is that Google is learning from your feedback, and already appears to be correcting just such an oversight.

One summary said “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” while another labeled a man living alone as “Sarah.” If the reports are accurate, a likely possibility is that Gemini on Google Home is hallucinating, rather than intruders or data mix-ups. With Halloween week upon us, it probably isn’t the best time for your smart home to start suggesting that people you aren’t familiar with have been wandering your property. However, a couple of Reddit users claim their Google Home devices have started describing people they don’t know. According to a post on the r/googlehome subreddit , a user’s Nest camera described an activity summary saying “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” even though no one by that name lives there. When the user asked about it, Google’s assistant reportedly replied that its camera “can identify faces even if you haven’t explicitly named them,” and that it had spotted “Michael” between October 26 and 27. The user said they’d never entered that name into the system, but the actions described were what he himself had done. He found the response …",

More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

The phone also loses Hasselblad branding, while the camera hardware could be a sidegrade. OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

I stopped using the Pixel Tablet in December 2023, and for all of 2024 and most of 2025, it was boxed up and stored in my parents’ basement. But about a month ago, I decided to dig out the Pixel Tablet and put it back in my apartment. And … I kind of love it.",

After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

It supports both wired and wireless setups, local microSD recording when wired, and integrations with Alexa and Google Assistant.
