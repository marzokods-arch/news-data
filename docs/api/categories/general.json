The Diablo series is known for the secret cow levels that Blizzard playfully refuses to acknowledge despite revisiting the reference in several games. Diablo 4, however, doesn't have one yet, no matter how hard people are still trying to find it with every new update. All the people who haven't given up hope and continue to scour the world for clues were probably thrilled to discover Blizzard quietly included a secret boss event in the latest season. While everyone was busy playing their new paladins , others were playing with body parts dropped from bosses trying to find a use for them. And they figured it out over the weekend. As you cycle through the new seasonal activities, you'll encounter some familiar demon lords from Diablo's story.

This report predicts that the winding down of SATA SSD production will contribute to already rising storage prices over the next two years. The Moore's Law Is Dead report reasons that, with so much of system and storage memory stock being eaten up by the rapidly expanding AI industry, it makes sense that Samsung would move away from more budget consumer fare like SSDs with a SATA interface.

After all, if you're getting cosy with certain boons in one run, it's easy to feel like the wax wings have been melted out from under you when a patch snatches that away. Talking to our friends over at GamesRadar , creative director Greg Kasavin seeks to soothe that particular ache: Kasavin uses the example of the Smithy Sprint, which was cut from the game during the Olympus Update . For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx.

Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition.

Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy?

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",

Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\". The crux of the issue here seems to be that Project Misriah uses assets from the Halo games, hence the use of the phrase \"Halo game content\".

Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you.

    "body": "As a kid I grew up on the Isle of Man, and near where I lived was a town called Castletown. In Castletown there was, predictably, a castle, and in the castle gatehouse was a model of an archer, standing with his bow drawn as if to aim through an arrowslit. Whenever someone passed through the gatehouse, the fake archer would yell \"Who goes there?\" in a big, booming voice. It's a phrase that has always stuck with me for some reason, one of those weird bits of mental detritus that rolls around at the back of the old braincase. Anyway, it got jostled right to the front when I first encountered Gate Guard Simulator, which is basically an entire game about asking the question \"Who Goes There?\" A Papers, Please variant wearing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 's codpiece, Gate Guard simulator puts you in the plate mail of the latest recruit to the castle guard, charged with vetting entry into your lord's domain. Each in-game day, you must stand at the threshold between civilisation and the wilderness, checking the paperwork of everyone from monks to minstrels. At a basic level, this involves assessing documentation to ensure that a citizen's family crests are authentic and not forged. But as yo…",

    "body": "Ironclad Games has kept Sins of a Solar Empire 2 fans well fed since the release of the space strategy sequel late last year, providing a frequent influx of updates and DLC. In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches. To summarise, planets no longer generate resources by default, with resource production instead based upon population. Hence, if a planet's population takes a big hit thr…",

    "body": "Despite the enormous success of Baldur's Gate 3 , Larian bid adieu to D&D after the completion of its landmark RPG and has opted to go back to its original world: The Divinity series, which includes one of our all-time favorite RPGs , Divinity: Original Sin 2. The new Larian RPG, which is just called Divinity , is probably not going to require you to be up-to-date on the series lore. But the series has a lot to offer for the curious, even if the games do get pretty crusty the further back you go. Here's what Baldur's Gate 3 fans and anyone else interested in the next big Larian RPG should know about Divinity. What are the games in the Divinity series? What order should you play the Divinity games in? Rather than experiencing the Divinity games chronologically by release date, or according to the internal timeline of the series, we suggest investigating them in reverse order of release . That has you starting with the best of them and working backwards until they get too crusty for you. So our recommendation is: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Divinity: Original Sin Divinity: Dragon Commander (If you're into strategy games) Divinity 2: Ego Draconis Beyond Divinity (you can skip this one u…",

    "body": "When I flew to China to play Phantom Blade Zero earlier this year, I left without one key piece of information: When it would be out. The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.
