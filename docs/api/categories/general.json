Because of this, it's incredibly easy to gather a lot in a short amount of time, and once you know what you're looking for, it's hard to miss. It's a great material to pick up each time you visit Wheatflour Wonderland, since you'll need it for a number of new recipes you'll unlock later down the line. It's also a great one-star gift for Cogimyun if you're stuck for ideas. Here's what you need to do to get your hands on some Noodle Grass to take back to Friendship Island. Where to find Noodle Grass in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Noodle Grass can be found throughout the grassy areas of Wheatflour Wonderland. In the rolling fields where the wheat grows, Noodle Grass will spawn around the edges. It's a tall plant with curly yellow stalks. When you walk up to a crop and interact with it, you'll basically just trim the twisted \"heads\" of the plant and leave the stumps.

Fortunately they are easy to find and spawn in huge numbers so you'll be crafting in no time. Wheatflour Wonderland is home to a lot of different gemstones that you'll need to collect, but Jemmies are unlike any of the bigger stones you'll come across. They're small clusters of coloured gemstones that appear on the ground rather than big glittery stones. Here's where you need to go if you want to collect some. Where to find Jemmies in Hello Kitty Island Adventure There is no specific place you need to head to find Jemmies in Wheatflour Wonderland. Instead, they spawn around the entire map. This includes across the fields, around the entrance, and around the main building. I've found a lot of Jemmies on floating islands toward the top right of the map, near the Crafting Court, or down the stairs leading to where the stained glass portraits of each character are on the floor.

After all, there are so many characters in Sanrio's wheelhouse that deserve a place in the game and that so many people already love. However, the announcement of the game's first DLC, Wheatflour Wonderland , still surprised me. It wasn't until I got into the magical new realm that I realised DLCs like this open up a whole new set of possibilities for Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and frankly I am shocked it's taken Sunblink this long to make one. Wheatflour Wonderland not only introduces Cogimyun, an incredibly underrated character in Sanrio's roster, but an entire new significantly sized area for you to explore, filled with new critters, ingredients, and puzzles to solve. On top of that, Wheatflour Wonderland comes with its own story involving the friends you've made, in an adventure ripped straight from Sailor Moon which would make my pink-frilled, six-year-old self sing.

Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/£180, it had better. As with every Kraken Kitty, the cat ears remain the crown jewel of this headset. To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

In fact, it's more convenient than ever thanks to Moxxi's Big Encore machines—devices that let you retry bosses as many times as you want. Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item? Well, there is, it's the Quincunx Stellium , a Maliwan shotgun. As showcased by content creator Moxsy…",

If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy—you can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline.

In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff.

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

    "body": "Development of Subnautica 2 has taken a bit of a back seat in the minds of players ever since the Unknown Worlds founders' lawsuit began. But a recent dev blog not only reveals that business has been carrying on as usual but also shows players a first look at a new kind of Leviathan coming to Subnautica 2: the Collector Leviathan. When designing the Collector, it was important to the dev team that it would be \"distinct from Leviathans in our previous Subnautica games,\" Cory Strader, the visual development lead, explains in the dev diary. \"We started with multiple rounds of quick, low-detail thumbnail sketches, exploring a wide range of shapes and silhouettes. And out of all of the designs, this Cthulhu-inspired beast resonated with the team.\" (Image credit: Krafton) It certainly looks like the kind of thing that would make my soul leave my body while venturing too far into the deep waters of Subnautica. And crucially, it doesn't just look terrifying; it's also extremely dangerous to players. \"Our main goal with creatures was to make them feel reactive,\" Antonio Munoz Gallego, gameplay lead engineer, says. \"The creature is constantly re-evaluating the situation in real time.\" Accor…",

    "body": "I can check one worry off the list for Battlefield 6: the large maps are, in fact, pretty large. This week I played a few hours of Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm, two maps that Battlefield Studios has been talking up as representative of Battlefield 6's scale. Even though I've played dozens of hours of multiplayer at this point, this Battlefield 6 demo felt personally make-or-break: EA's focus on small maps (and one medium) in the open beta was a letdown, and it helped fuel the impression that it's more interested in converting Call of Duty players than winning back Battlefield long-timers. That's still probably true—Battlefield 6 is following Call of Duty's model so closely that it's got the same gunsmith system, the same small-scale modes, and the same battle royale spinoff in the works—but Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm are the best evidence yet that this is still Battlefield to the core. Mirak Valley is a spacious, intimidating war zone. The middle lane is a gauntlet of villages and battle-worn trenches that collide at the center in a massive construction site overseen by a precariously placed crane. Sure would be a shame if somebody knocked it over... Nice. Mirak …",

    "body": "Ever since I've been aware of our ranking of the best PC controllers for gaming , the Xbox Wireless Controller has sat atop it. And that's for good reason. With comfortable textured grips, a great feel, a sturdy build, and a classic look, it's still a bit of a banger five years after its Xbox Series X refresh. That refresh added a new share button, and it adds a lot for someone like me who clips arguably far too much from my games. However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",

    "body": "The Kickballer in Borderlands 4 is a standout legendary shotgun, dealing massive damage and—oh, what's that?—kicking your FPS off a cliff with the amount of effects going on. The Kickballer fires bouncing projectiles, and when you hit a shot, it'll fire a second one for free, leading to some very high damage numbers and game-breaking visuals. However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it. Don't worry, though, here's how to get this game-breaking shotgun. How to get the Kickballer in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) The Kickballer is a dedicated drop from Sludgemaw in Watershed Gate, Idolator's Noose, in the Fadefields . To even unlock this boss, you need to complete the Null and Void side mission and its follow-up quest, All Charged Up , which becomes available after beating the Rush the Gate main mission. You can start Null and Void by speaking to Rush just south of The Launchpad, near Idolator Sol's crashed ship that you'll have visited earlier in the main story. Speak to him and complete this quest, involving track…",
