The rest linger in the deep cuts, but certainly fan favorites, of her work. Spanning her career from 2008’s Fearless to 2025’s The Life of a Showgirl – currently enjoying its sixth week atop the Billboard 200 – her title tracks show the breadth and depth of her sonic evolution, from her country roots to her pop superstardom, with her signature storytelling lyricism on display.

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

To better bridge the gap between these input methods, Google is working on new features in Android 17 that will give gamers more control over button presses.

And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works.

All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging.

Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s Smart Manager app has received a hefty update for One UI 8.5. The update brings features such as native app lock, the ability to restore apps to their previous state after a crash, and more. Unfortunately, the Smart Manager app is restricted to China, while global users get the Device Care menu. Samsung phones in global markets have the Device Care menu, which is a one-stop hub for maintaining your phone. However, Chinese users have the Smart Manager app, and it will receive some new features as part of the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. GalaxyTechie on Twitter (h/t: SammyGuru ) spotted these Smart Manager additions and highlighted them. Some of the most notable new features include native app lock functionality, app state restoration, and sleep standby optimization.",

The November Pixel Feature Drop still applies to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 phones, so they aren’t missing out on any new features. Google rolled out the November Pixel update earlier this week, right alongside the latest Pixel Drop . The update brought new improvements and bug fixes to the Pixel 7a and above. Naturally, users quickly noticed that the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro were missing from the list of devices receiving Google’s monthly bug-fix update. Folks also speculated that Google is dropping monthly updates for the phones in favor of quarterly patches. It doesn’t help that Google does not provide a public list that definitively separates Pixel phones into monthly and quarterly update groups like Samsung.
