You might want to tank damage and wade into the fray, you might prefer to hang back and snipe enemies, or even get up close and personal with a knife for that tasty sneak attack bonus. No matter your planned build, there are plenty of unique armor options to grab early in the game that'll set you up for success. These 12 unique armor pieces all come from the first region, Paradise Island, plus I've included two good ones you can get shortly after you leave. Besides their unique mod, each of these armor pieces also has an additional mod slot, and a basic set bonus you can see in the corresponding image. Monocular Target-Finder (Image credit: Obsidian) Range Scanner : Grants additional Weakspot damage relative to how far away the target is. Further distances grant a larger bonus, but damage falloff is still applicable. Damage bonus maxes out at +30% at 100 meters.

All you know is that there's mysterious unclaimed loot behind the door you want to pilfer. The reason the Free Market Station lock puzzle is seemingly impossible is because that's actually kind of true. You need a special gadget in order to be able to interact with the puzzle properly at all: the N-Ray. Below, I've included info about where to find said N-Ray, but also I've added a video of me solving the puzzle without it—if you follow my switch-flipping order, it should open the door for you either way. Free Market Station lock puzzle solution in The Outer Worlds 2 Now, the proper way you're supposed to solve this puzzle is to acquire the N-Ray gadget at the N-Ray Range in northwest Golden Ridge.

This leaves you with three choices: kill De Vries, spare De Vries, or spare De Vries and let her assassinate the representatives. Each option has its own set of consequences, so I've laid them out below, including the path you need to take dialogue-wise to get De Vries to stand down.

You can spare De Vries with some skill checks if you discovered enough info about her (Image credit: Obsidian) The simplest way to resolve the situation is to kill De Vries and stop her from assassinating the peace representatives.

The rarity of said keys makes choosing which lockboxes to open a tough decision. Though, as you explore Arcadia's many moons and planets, you'll find more High Security Lockboxes with a wider variety of unique gear, so there's nothing wrong with holding onto your keys until you find something you actually want. Outer Worlds 2 High Security Lockbox locations I've found 11 High Security Lockboxes across the game's first few areas. Here's where you can find each, what it'll cost you to open in terms of keys, plus I've added map screenshots to the entries where the boxes are tricky to find.

After you finish Paradise Island, you can head to Free Market Station, where you'll find Fionna F. Walker in the upstairs room of The 2nd Choice. This specialist Sub Rosa merchant is an avid collector of Tossball and Pitchball Cards, and she challenges you to beat her collection. The prize? Access to her inventory of weird and wonderful weapons and armour, including some of the strangest in the game. It's worth grabbing any Tossball or Pitchball Cards you see either way, since they give you a buff for each one. Below I've included 25 card locations (the number you need to beat Fionna) that you can grab early in the game. I've also included details about what Fionna sells once you've amassed the cards.

Once you've collected a lockbox containing an item you like the look of (you can view them all in the hold of your ship), you'll need enough keys to unseal it.

For those in a rush or who are simply stuck, here are the answers to all three of the questions, as well as what you'll get for a reward. The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 .

    "body": "There's no feeling quite like taming a horse in Minecraft, trying to ride it back to your base, and being met with a huge body of water. The sinking feeling in your chest, knowing that you'll either have to leave it there and run off in an attempt to find the materials to craft a lead, or simply push it by walking into it, is one we've all felt before. Fortunately, the Mounts of Mayhem drop is putting a stop to this, and all mounts will now be able to swim across bodies of water. Hallelujah! That's not all the exciting news about the Mounts of Mayhem drop either. Three news mobs have been shared in an official blog post , including one new mount and two new variants. They all spawn in the desert, and often come as a package deal rather than appearing separately, which is bound to make the usually barren biome a lot more exciting. As someone who usually avoids exploring the desert unless I really must, I'm looking forward to having a reason to, rather than aimlessly wandering. That's until I inevitably lose my inventory to its new inhabitants, of course. The parched is a new skeleton variant, but unlike their standard version they won't burn in daylight. In fact, the blog post expl…",

Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage.

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week .
