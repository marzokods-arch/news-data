While the family confirmed his passing, artists across genres — dancehall, pop, rock and reggae royalty — are now publicly honoring the singer’s legacy. Sean Paul was among the first to share a tribute , posting a black-and-white image of Cliff on Instagram and writing, “R.I.P 2 a real general. He hit them the harder they came. Fly high my G.” Fans immediately echoed the sentiment, remembering Cliff as one of the musicians who helped shape the global identity of reggae. Yusuf/Cat Stevens, whose 1970 song “Wild World” became one of Cliff’s signature recordings, shared a heartfelt message on Facebook. “A powerful presence,” he wrote. “God bless him. His songs always had some message of peace — may he find it now and forever.” The Marley family also honored him, noting Cliff’s pivotal role in Bob Marley’s early career. “Jimmy was an instrumental figure in Bob’s coming up,” they wrote on Instagram. “He brought him to pro…",

Qi2 didn’t simplify matters either, with the Pixel 10 series adding Qi2 support but misbehaving on older Qi chargers , as reported by many users and shown in my own testing.

At first glance, the new Honor Choice Bee AI Projector Air looks like a basic compact projector, but it also supports stylus input and gesture controls. In other words, the device can turn your wall into a makeshift writing surface. It’s an odd combo that is definitely niche, yet potentially useful for your next game night. For now, the device has only launched in China, but it introduces a unique angle to the budget projector space. The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling. For specs, Honor lists 1080p resolution and 280 CVIA lumens of brightness. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI 2.0, USB, and a headphone jack. It also features a built-in 5W speaker.",

Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

I think it’s 45 shows,” Grande said. “It’s not that small, but it’s at least half of what I used to do.” The 2026 tour follows her Billboard No. 1 album Eternal Sunshine , released earlier this year, and marks her return to full-scale live performance after stepping away from music to film the two-part Wicked movie franchise. That period, Grande said, played a transformative role in reshaping her relationship with fame, creativity and the pressures that accompany commercial success. “I’ve just been healing my relationship to music and touring over the past couple of years,” she told Kidman, explaining that acting helped her reconnect with the joy of creating without the intensity that once accompanied her pop stardom.

Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",

This particular leak centers around the 2026 version of the Moto G Stylus . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

While there was a fair amount to appreciate about the changes, we also lost some functionality in the process, and maybe top on that list of missing abilities was the app’s tool for perspective correction.

Besides, my traditional vacuum was doing just fine, even if I did have to grab a mop from my closet afterwards. Then, the Roborock Qrevo CurvX showed up, and it changed my tune. Between its ultra-thin design, powerful suction, and smart features that actually ensure that I don’t have to keep a constant eye on it, it’s pretty much taken over my home cleaning routine.
