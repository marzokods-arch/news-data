It’s taken a while, but the company is finally bringing its promised features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 . Google announced on its Google Pixel Buds Help forum that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is getting a new update right now (version 4.467). This update includes Adaptive Audio and Loud Noise Protection. The former feature dynamically adjusts your earbud volume based on your surroundings, while the latter automatically reduces the volume of loud noises around you (e.g., a siren blaring).",

The newest firmware update, version 5.18.5, strengthens Amazon’s Digital Rights Management (DRM) — the copy-protection system that prevents people from freely backing up or transferring Kindle books. Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method.

And my friend, today is your lucky day, as Google shares its very latest Canary build. Back in August, Google hit us hard. In one day, not only did we see the Pixel 10 series debut, but we got both our first Android 16 QPR2 beta and the release of Android Canary 2508 . One month later, it’s time for Google’s next build, and today Android Canary 2509 is on its way out to testers.",

So far, all you’ve needed to activate it was your phone number — so anyone who knew it could potentially lock your phone. That’s now slightly more secure with the addition of an optional security question. Google offers plenty of automatic ways to try and limit your exposure when someone takes off with your smartphone. Features like Theft Detection use sensors to know when a thief grabs your phone and makes a break for it, while Offline Device Lock prevents a thief from using a lack of connectivity to give them more time with an unlocked handset. Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools. And if you’re using 2FA like you should, signing into a new device without your phone could be a little tricky. With Remote Lock turned on, all you need is your phone number and a web browser — you just go to android.com/lock and enter your number…",

It’s selling for $199 at Verizon, and will soon be available at Total Wireless. If you’re looking for a budget-level tablet, there are plenty of options to choose from. TCL’s tablets, in particular, stand out from the rest of the crowd due to the company’s innovative NXTPAPER tech. It’s a smooth, textured display that feels a lot like paper and offers a few benefits, like reducing eye strain and not attracting fingerprints. Earlier this year, TCL debuted the next generation of this display, NXTPAPER 4.0 , with the NXTPAPER 11 Plus. Now the manufacturer is putting this tech in a new tablet that’s even more affordable. Today, TCL announced the launch of a compact tablet called the TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G. As mentioned earlier, this device features an NXTPAPER 4.0 display. That screen measures 8.7 inches and has a resolution of 800 x 1,340.

    "body": "TL;DR The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus has been launched, offering a Raspberry Pi computer inside a mechanical keyboard. Other upgrades include RGB lighting, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD via an M.2 slot. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is available at a starting price of $200. The Raspberry Pi 400 was an intriguing release back in 2020, as it was the first official Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard. This effectively enabled an all-in-one PC experience. We’ve since seen the Raspberry Pi 500, and now the company has upped the ante with the Raspberry Pi 500 Plus. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is indeed a full-fledged Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard, but it offers various major upgrades over the Pi 500. For one, we’ve now got a mechanical keyboard with removable keycaps and RGB lighting.",

We’ve uncovered a GIF for a new “Create” feature in the Google Photos app, suggesting it’ll use Nano Banana inside the app. It’s unclear when the feature will roll out, but it’ll certainly make editing images in Google Photos more fun. Last month, Google rolled out Nano Banana , its newest AI-powered image editing tool, inside the Gemini app. Since then, it’s sparked viral trends online, from turning selfies into 3D figurines to erasing fences from photos, generating images from scratch, adding scenic backdrops, and even experimenting with new looks. The best thing about Nano Banana is that it isn’t locked behind a paywall. It’s available in every country, across personal, work, and paid versions of Gemini, so just about anyone can try it out. Now, it seems Google is preparing to bring the magic of Nano Banana to an even wider audience by building it directly into Google Photos.

YouTube has announced that it is introducing a couple of updates. One of the updates will add a “Hide” button that will hide the end screens in the video you’re watching.

YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone. The site has long struggled to take appropriate measures to protect its young and vulnerable users, while still letting adults enjoy more mature material — within reason. Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history.

We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority I’ve been using Pixel phones for years now, and I don’t plan on switching to another brand anytime soon. While I did own a bunch of OnePlus phones in the past and have hands-on experience with just about every major brand out there, Pixel remains my phone of choice. Pixels aren’t perfect — no device ever is — but they have all the ingredients that make up a great phone , at least for my personal wants and needs. Here are the five key reasons why the brand is so close to my heart.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

Just about five years after the Nest Audio launched in October 2020, word on the street is that Google will soon debut the “Google Home Speaker.” Google first teased its new speaker in August during the Pixel 10 launch event, while subsequent leaks have confirmed its existence and indicated that it’s almost certainly being released before the end of the year.",

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has initiated the One UI 8 Watch beta program for the Galaxy Watch 6. The update is currently live in South Korea, but we expect wider availability to be announced soon. Meanwhile, it has also concluded testing for the Galaxy Watch 7, indicating a stable update may be coming soon. Samsung recently rolled out stable One UI 8 to the Galaxy S25 series and has been testing beta builds on nearly a dozen other flagships and mid-range devices. Besides phones, the One UI 8 Watch is also set to arrive on a range of supported Galaxy Watch models. While the Galaxy Watch 8 series came preinstalled with One UI 8 Watch, the Watch Ultra followed soon after. Meanwhile, a beta has been underway for the last generation Galaxy Watch 7 series, and the program is now being extended to the older Galaxy Watch 6. According to a user’s post on Samsung Community forums , One UI 8 Watch beta is now available for the Galaxy Watch 6. It’s safe to presume that the update also applies to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, as the two devices share the same hardware.",

While the mic input currently turns off after a response, you may have the option to continue conversations without tapping the mic button on the screen again. Additionally, Google has also added an option to disable Gemini’s voice-based responses on watches entirely. Gemini is set to arrive on Nest and other Google Home speakers next week, following its recent rollout to smart TVs with the Google TV interface . However, for much longer than these platforms, Gemini has been available on Wear OS devices , and it may soon be upgraded to facilitate smoother conversations.

We previously reported that Google may be planning to merge Chrome OS and Android, unifying the two operating systems. This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

Not all users are eligible; the discount offer may be US-exclusive. Google jacked up the prices of its Nest Aware subscriptions in July, bumping fees by 25 to 33% on both monthly and annual plans. The move prompted backlash online, with commenters around the internet (including here on Android Authority) declaring that they canceled their service or planned to in response to the hikes. Now, though, you might be able to hang onto your subscription a little longer without overpaying. As reported by 9to5Google , Google’s trying to appease disgruntled subscribers. Some users who attempt to cancel their Nest Aware plans are being offered significant discounts to keep their subscriptions active.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR The Google Play Store can now handle up to six app downloads or updates at a time. Previously, the Play Store only supported three simultaneous downloads or updates. In the past, if you downloaded or updated multiple apps in the Play Store, you would have to wait as those apps downloaded or updated one by one. Google eventually upped this restriction to three apps at a time, and even tested raising it to four. Now it looks like the Play Store has pretty much doubled the limit. Spotted by the folks over at SammyGuru , it appears there’s been a significant improvement in the number of updates the Play Store can handle. In its testing, the outlet was able to get up to six apps updating at the same time. Any app past six remained in the “Pending” state until a new spot opened up.",

While you can turn many of your smart home devices on and off, not all options are accessible through the web. Google Home is having a moment. After a shaky summer of Home glitches that had some users clamoring for justice, over the past few weeks it’s felt like Google has finally started giving Home some long overdue attention, prepping for it getting access to Gemini , and updating it with new device controls . Another big upgrade has been in the works for Google Home on the web , and just a few weeks back we heard about new options arriving for its Public Preview program. Now those are finally ready for all of us to try. When you’re controlling a whole house full of smart-home devices, it can be easy to get overwhelmed — who’s used to thinking about all their lightbulbs separately? And while Google does an admirable job of letting us group those and manage them through the Home app on our phone, sometimes the easiest course of action is just moving to a larger display — one of the many reasons we’re so thankful t…",
