For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X.

And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so.

When we’re anticipating the next generation of one of our favorite mobile devices, we get very excited when the first specs start arriving. Right away, we’re going to be comparing those against existing models, looking at what’s getting better, what’s staying the same, and what — god forbid — is getting a downgrade.

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

The image from Android Headlines reveals a triple-camera setup, an extra side button, and a grippy-looking back, but no view of the front display. Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",
