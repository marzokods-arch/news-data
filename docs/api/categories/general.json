In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.

It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

It surges 18-9 with 46,000 equivalent album units earned (up 68%) in the United States in the week ending Dec. 4, according to Luminate. It was last in the top 10 on the Jan. 7, 2023-dated chart, when it ranked at No. 10. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. Of the 46,000 units the album earned for the week, album sales comprise 20,000 — up 64% and largely owed to vinyl purchases; it jumps 10-4 on Top Album Sales. The album earns its biggest sales week in three years, since it sold 23,000 copies on the Dec. 31, 2022. chart. A Charlie Brown Christmas is among a cro…",

Portable gaming hardware keeps getting more and more powerful, and the aptly-named Super X is here to bring desktop-level power to a two-in-one tablet design. It isn’t cheap, but it blows traditional devices like the Surface Pro out of the water. The OneXPlayer Super X packs up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 128GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful devices you can buy. It’s far from the only device with this chipset, but its killer feature is that it can transform between a tablet and a laptop. There’s a kickstand in the back, which, paired with the magnetic keyboard included with early bird purchases, turns it into a real portable powerhouse.",

While Google Glass could be considered ahead of its time, Google Cardboard allowed users to experience virtual reality with scrappy hardware. And while it spent the time since reorienting its priorities, Android XR appears to give us a glimpse of the future, without our eyes being shrouded by bulky hardware. At an event in San Jose, California, Google gave my colleague C. Scott Brown a preview of the different styles of XR glasses it is working on. Unlike the Galaxy XR, which is also powered by Google’s specialized software, these glasses serve only part of the purpose, but also at a fraction of the cost and with much less burden on your skull.",

It remains unclear whether the Gemini experience will run within the app or redirect users externally to the Gemini app. Gemini started off slow, but Google has made great progress in making the AI digital assistant actually useful. The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

As expected, it’s a modern take on the Xperia Play, incorporating not just the design language, but also the name. The AYANEO Pocket PLAY is a modern take on the ill-fated Sony Ericsson handheld, with a sliding design that will take you right back to 2011. Several other recent devices like the ANBERNIC RG Slide and the magnetic MCON controller also incorporate sliding mechanisms, but this is the first sliding gaming phone released in nearly 15 years.",

After months of leaks, Samsung’s next big update, One UI 8.5, is finally ready for beta testing. And it brings a highly modified interface that could spark opinions about drawing inspiration from Apple’s iOS 26 . But in addition to the renewed system UI and apps, One UI 8.5 is also bringing improvements to key functionalities, and one of them is how screen recording works. With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

This feature uses the Miracast standard to extend your desktop to the phone’s 10-inch screen without requiring any cables. You can connect by opening the Second Screen page on the phone and pressing “Windows + K” on your PC to find the device. With the Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has finally delivered on the original promise of foldable phones : a device that truly transforms from a phone into a tablet. When folded, you interact with a standard 6.5-inch cover display, but unfolding it reveals a massive 10-inch screen. The inner display is so large, in fact, that the software treats it like a tablet, even enabling standalone Samsung DeX directly on the device. But the TriFold’s utility doesn’t end there: it can also function as a secondary monitor for your PC. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031.

Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade.

That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home .
