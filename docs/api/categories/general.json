But FEAR was so good there should be an entire subgenre based on it. There should be an entire cottage industry of indie studios making singleplayer shooters with slow-motion and advanced enemy AI and something supernatural thrown in to give you the willies just when you're feeling overpowered. Anyway, instead of being all sad about how history becomes legend and legend becomes myth, let's celebrate the fact that FEAR remains incredibly playable today‚Äîif you download the Echo Patch . It's not one of those games that's completely busted without mods, but if you play it at any resolution above 1080p all the text will look like it was written for ants. The Echo Patch fixes that, and adds controller support so you can play it on your Steam Deck. It also lets you disable the letterboxing in cutscenes and optionally make the flashlight last forever if you don't want to have to chase down batteries for it. In terms of bugfixes, the Echo Patch deals with a lot of problems that emerge if you run FEAR at high framerates. The‚Ä¶",

Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens. Central to the series' appeal was how its action scenes grew more impressive and elaborate with every passing episode, and it was always fun to see how far Krinkels could push things when a new entry dropped. I haven't thought about Madness for a long time (though the series hasn't gone away, as I'll get to shortly). But those memories came flooding back when I spied Somewhere in Hell , a Doom 2 mod that goes to impressive lengths to recreate Madness' flashy, bloody action in id Software's shooter sequel. Somewhere in Hell basically replaces Doom's weapons and enemies with goons and firearms from Krinkels' animations.

It's easily one of my favorite games, but if you're not into the story as it stands, then the MMORPG isn't worth it. I will, however, show you this freakishly adorable baby Seikret minion revealed with the collab rewards and walk away. Whatever happens after is not my business. The baby Seikret (along with a Vigorwasp minion) is headed to the MMORPG in October when FF14 kicks off its collaboration with Monster Hunter Wilds. I know some of you are disappointed it's not a Palico, and I get it; they're cute. But we already got one when Rathalos landed in Stormblood's crossover with Monster Hunter: World, and you can still unlock the Palico (or Poogie) to this day. Anyway, look at this guy. An absolutely useless, flightless little chunk of a bird with not a thought behind those eyes. I'll fight Arkveld all by myself to get one. Computer, enhance. (Image credit: Square Enix, Capcom) The latest update to FF14's Monster Hunter Wilds crossover site detailed a few other rewards, too, along with more on Arkveld's trial, The Windward Wilds.

Earlier this week, I spoke to Newzoo director of market intelligence Emmanuel Rosier about what young gamers are up to, and two aspects of his perspective stuck out to me the most: Gen Alpha doesn't care if it can run Crysis.

It can be upgraded, too, which makes it more effective and able to latch onto enemies, pull them toward you, and knock them down. Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game. If you simply don't want to wait, you can rush through the story quests one right after another, but I would recommend doing at least a few sidequests along the way, too.

He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet‚Ä¶",

Once you get a rhythm going, this loot loop can get pretty efficient, all but for one thing: Your cooldowns don't reset, and depending on your build, that might slow down your progress significantly. Even my current build, which makes use of a Repkit with cooldown reduction to keep my Peacebreaker Cannons (now horrifying elemental lasers) bumped up into this. When you're grinding hard, those few seconds add up to minutes‚Äîand I'm a busy person. Zed's got your back, though. All due credit to user Zohirflame on the game's subreddit for bring‚Ä¶",

Adventure of Samsara , which released on September 4, was more fated to obscurity than most, despite being published by an ascendant Atari. Because September 4 was also the day Silksong released. Few were going to make time for a handsome but orthodox pixel art metroidvania when the joys and indignities of Pharloom beckon. Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end.

The writer and director of 2022's Barbarian and this year's Weapons now has two solid horror hits under his belt, and is in pre-production on his next one: a Resident Evil movie planned for 2026. That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie‚Äîthe film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Despite the YouTuber's predilection for katanas and Sekiro, Ongbal only favored the Sekiro-parrying samurai character, Executor, early on, with his videos quickly transitioning to focus on Wylder gameplay.
