While not the cheapest overall, Tello’s plan includes free calling to 60+ countries, adding strong value for international callers. Tello is easily one of the very best prepaid options out there for those on a tight budget who don’t need truly unlimited data, but it’s typically not ideal for heavier users unless you keep most of your data consumption to Wi-Fi. Up until now, Tello’s $25 Unlimited plan has been capped at just 35GB of high-speed data, after which it essentially goes down to nearly unusable speeds that aren’t much better than dial-up.

But limiting the image-to-image generation tool just for amusement or entertainment undermines its true potential. That’s why Google has been testing ways to combine it with other tools, including AI Mode , to deliver more refined search results. Google has now confirmed the move, while also expanding Nano Banana to tools beyond Search. Google recently announced that Nano Banana is coming to Search through Lens. With Lens, you can now snap a picture and transform it with Nano Banana by adding a text prompt. This update makes Lens just another way to access the Nano Banana, which previously required the Gemini app.",

Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

Vivo has confirmed that the phones will be available globally, along with the external lens accessory. We thought the vivo X200 Pro was one of the best camera phones of the year. That’s largely due to fantastic long-range zoom and plenty of video options. Now, the company has announced the vivo X300 series, including the X300 Pro. The series consists of the standard X300 and the X300 Pro, and both devices have a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chipset, IP69 ratings, and OriginOS 6 atop Android 16 . The two phones also sport a minimum display brightness of just one nit. Both devices also opt for an iPhone-style design with more rounded corners and a flat metal frame, much like the OPPO Find X8 series last year.",

    "body": "TL;DR The LineageOS team has released LineageOS 23.0, bringing Android 16 to over 100 different devices. This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions. The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Update, October 14, 2025 (05:20 AM ET): The developer behind the Pixel IMS app has implemented a workaround that enables VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in regions where these features are not supported. Original article, October 11, 2025 (09:00 AM ET): Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling feat…",

Still, Pixel phones lag behind some of their competitors in ease of customization.

Some of this is expected, such as your Social Security number, home address, and payment details. Beyond that, carriers also enable settings that allow them to collect data from your web browsing, location, and more. While they do not directly access this information themselves, it is used to build advertising profiles and personalize your experience. It is also not just for internal use. The big three carriers share, and in some cases sell, personal information to other companies for targeted ads or credit checks. When you consider the steady stream of high-profile security breaches carriers have faced in recent years, it is understandable if the idea of handing over even more data makes you uneasy.",
