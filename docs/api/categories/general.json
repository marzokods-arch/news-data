It’s significantly easier to make mistakes while typing on a smartphone than on a PC, which is why keyboard apps like Gboard have aggressive auto-correction tools turned on by default.

The changes include allowing developers to link to alternative download methods, use external payment systems, and set their own prices. In July 2025, Google lost an appeal against the original Epic vs Google lawsuit , which meant the company had just 14 days to make sweeping changes to the Google Play Store. Google appealed to the Supreme Court after this decision and also separately filed for a stay until its appeal is decided. Unfortunately for Google, the Supreme Court has declined the company’s request to temporarily stay parts of those sweeping changes from taking effect. The net result? Google now has 14 days once again to change several Google Play Store policies. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G.

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR A leaker has revealed more purported details about the rumored OnePlus 15T smartphone. The phone is said to retain a similarly small screen size as its predecessor, while bringing a 7,000mAh+ battery. The OnePlus 15T will likely be called the OnePlus 15s if it’s released outside China. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 13T in China earlier this year (known as the OnePlus 13s in India), and it’s one of the few pocket-friendly Android phones on the market. We’ve heard murmurs of a successor, and a leaker has now revealed plenty more apparent features. Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu has revealed a variety of purported details about the OnePlus 15T, which will likely be the OnePlus 15s if it launches outside China. For starters, the phone is said to have a 6.3-inch screen size and a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset.",

The letter alleged that their account had been involved in accessing websites hosting questionable material, including “sites promoting hacking activities” or “featuring fictional characters presented as underage”. The post immediately sparked debate over whether this was a phishing scam or simply a karma-farming attempt, though many users chimed in to say they had received similar letters. Adding to the intrigue, the source email appeared to be legitimate, as the same address is referenced in an unrelated official court document .",
