From the moment we set it up, I noticed how familiar this phone felt to my own Galaxy S24, inside and out. After setting it up, I didn’t dwell on it much until about a week or two later, when I asked my daughter if she was okay with the phone still.

With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android.

The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

    "body": "TL;DR The 8849 Tank X is a rugged Android phone with a built-in 1080p DLP projector. It features niche features for outdoor adventuring plus 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and a massive 17,600mAh battery. Pre-orders are live now, with shipping expected in early February. Rugged phones are rarely shy about excess, but 8849’s Tank X pushes the envelope. Alongside its oversized battery and reinforced frame, the phone adds an unusual headline feature: a built-in 1080p projector. The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

The case hinged on the “conversion” of cellular data purchased from mobile carriers, specifically, which plaintiffs argued is their property. Google will pay out $135 million to affected users and make adjustments to Android behavior and terms of service. Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge. Assuming there aren’t any last-minute changes, anyone in the US (outside of California) who’s accessed the internet using a cellular network on an Android device since November 12, 2017 will be eligible to claim part of the settlement.",

It allows you to log in to your Epic Games account to browse and download games on your Android device. Support is still experimental, and multiplayer games are not working. The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

Demand for affordable 4G devices remains surprisingly high, as seen in the success of the Galaxy A06 4G, which sold more than any Galaxy S25 series flagship.

Take, for instance, the Galaxy S25 series , which launched globally in January 2025, giving it a strong position to emerge as a global top-seller in 2025.
