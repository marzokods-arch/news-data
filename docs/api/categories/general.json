On Monday (Jan. 12), the rapper released the visual for “ Helicopter$, ” his first music video of 2026. Shortly after the video dropped, online chatter began questioning whether the trippy, animated visuals were AI-generated — prompting Rocky to respond directly on social media. “THIS VIDEO IS NOT Ai GENERATED! THIS VIDEO IS NOT Ai GENERATED!” Rocky wrote several times on X after the release, adding, “JUST GENERATIONAL.” The Dan Streit-directed video leans into the surreal, high-concept aesthetic Rocky has become known for throughout his career, and features the Harlem native leading his crew around the city in a stolen helicopter, while a cop chase ensues. The track is expected to appear on his forthcoming fourth studio album, Don’t Be Dumb , which drops January 16. An earlier version of the song featured Playboi Carti, though the official release centers on Rocky alone. “Helicopter$” arrives just one week after Rocky shared the video for “ Punk Rocky ,” which starred Winona Ryder and included cameo appearances from Danny Elfman, Thundercat and A$AP Nast.

It addresses shipping delays, poor customer service, quality control, and more. The company has also delayed the Pocket Play campaign while it works to implement the changes. AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott. After a poorly received initial response , AYANEO’s CEO stepped in to provide a full statement and “ Service Improvement Plan ” to turn things around in 2026.",

Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

    "body": "Pixels have always put the “smart” in the word smartphone. They’ve stood for the best of the smart features and AI capabilities the smartphone world has ever seen, and have often led from the front. Compared to the AI features Pixels have been offering for years, like Magic Eraser, Apple Intelligence barely holds ground. I was mighty impressed by the Pixel 10 that launched last year, and I genuinely think it’s a better phone than even the Pro model. Yet, I still feel the Pixel 10 series just wasn’t enough. There’s only so much Google can do to improve the Pixel 10 series through software updates — and to be fair, it does quite a lot. But as we enter 2026, my hopes are firmly placed on the Pixel 11. We still have a few months before the next Pixel launches, but I want to use this time to share my wishlist with Google.",

Between years of data archives, larger photo files, and even larger 4K video-first content capture being the norm, for many of us, it has morphed into a significant monthly bill that we aren’t really in a position to cancel. Over here at Android Authority , we’ve talked about Network Attached Storage, or NAS , as a solution for the privacy-conscious or the tech-savvy enthusiasts who want to de-Google their lives and reduce their cloud dependence. We’ve even talked about data sovereignty and actually owning your files in a world that desperately wants you to rent them.

With a future update, your Android device may also tell you the exact time your clock has moved. This will save time trying to figure out the time difference yourself. With Android 16 QPR2 , which rolled out last month, Google introduced alerts every time your phone automatically switches to a new timezone . However, the feature doesn’t tell you exactly how many hours or minutes your clocks shifted, which can make you take an extra step to look it up on Google if you’re unaware of the exact time difference or want to figure out the time where your journey originated. But Google now appears to have reconsidered and might soon fill that vacuum. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

New code strings suggest that locked app notifications will show generic “New message” or “New notification” text instead of the usual notification content. It’s unclear whether the app name and icon in the notification will also be hidden. We’re slowly and steadily marching towards the release of Android 17 , which could come with new features such as a long-awaited native App Lock solution. We already have a decent idea of how this rumored feature would work, but there were a few unknowns, one of which was how the feature would handle incoming notifications from locked apps.
