She&#8217;d seen some success in her U.K. home country with 2023 debut album Messy , but even there, the singer-songwriter was still more of a critical favorite than a proven hitmaker. But when 2025 hit, Dean turned it on early, and the next 12 months proved one long crescendo that has climaxed with her beginning the new year as one of the biggest artists in popular music, on either side of the pond.

    "body": "Credit: Google TL;DR Nano Banana was a last-minute codename cooked up at 2:30 AM for the Gemini image model going live on LMArena. The name comes from a Google Product Manager’s personal nicknames, and the internet loved it. The branding stuck, went viral, and now lives on as Nano Banana Pro. If you’ve heard of or used AI image generators, you’ve definitely come across Google’s Nano Banana . Even if you’re not into using AI to create images, you’ve probably seen Nano Banana’s work all over social media. The image model is freakishly good at editing and generating images, and we’re sure that, like us, you’ve always wondered what made Google name it Nano Banana. Now, we finally have the full answer, and the story behind the delightfully silly name.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

As compensation for the wait, AYANEO is offering a $15 store coupon to all buyers, plus an accessory bundle for Elite backers. Android gaming handheld launches have been feeling fragile lately, with rising memory costs and shortages largely to blame. It’s no minor issue, with a new update from AYANEO shedding a worrying light on just how bad that problem has become. In the case of the KONKR Pocket FIT Elite, the company says memory prices nearly tripled, causing AYANEO to lose money on the device. In a detailed post on Indiegogo , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket FIT Elite is still expected to begin shipping in March after the Chinese New Year shutdowns. While that timeline broadly matches what the company said in late December , the update goes much further by explaining exactly why the Elite model ran into trouble in the first place.",

It offered a private viewing experience, supported limited game input… and was very, very bad. Heavy, uncomfortable to wear, and worst of all, featuring a low-res, blurry screen, it coasted by on sheer novelty. Obviously, things have gotten a lot better since then, but until XREAL handed me its latest AR glasses, I really had no idea just how far we’d come.",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",
