Why do all these trauma-inducing monstrosities want to kill you? Because you’re there. These games are not works of narrative genius and that’s entirely to their credit. They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever.

House of Necrosis is just that, a turn-based horror game reminiscent of the old-school ones I grew up on. Plus, I can't help but compare this creepy old house to Resident Evil's Spencer Mansion, but there's no Albert to be found. Instead, there's plenty of huge monsters, zombies, and evil crows, yes, you heard me, there's a murderous murder of crows.

You do play as a special forces agent investigating a string of murders in an isolated forest, though, so I think your character knew what she was getting herself into. I, on the other hand, didn't, or at least I didn't think I'd encounter a huge monster with a claw for its hand so soon after I just got to grips with outsmarting a murder of crows.

Out tomorrow, I spoke with some of Absolum's developers at Dotemu about their creative process behind the cast of four: Galandra (broadsword-swinging warrior), Karl (stout dwarven brawler), Cider (the prosthetic ninja), and Brome (frog wizard). PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them. So the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture.

Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it. In a chat with PCG at this year's GDC, Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said that's entirely the point. \"From the very beginning I said, 'I think that for this to be compelling in the way that I want it to be, there cannot be a right answer'\". In fact, it sounds like Sawyer himself doesn't have a clear culprit in mind for the game's evildoings. \"People on the team would ask me [who the culprit is], then people at Xbox would ask me, and I'm like, 'No!

And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are.

The community website is loading and most players are connected to Steam services, but the store is intermittently on and off. Original story below. It's Tuesday morning on the west coast, and Steam is down. The website Steamstat.us is reporting multiple errors on the gaming storefront. The APIs for multiple Valve games, including Counter-Strike 2 and Deadlock, are also registering as offline. While Steamstat.us reports that many players are still connected to Steam's services, the store and community websites seem to be completely down. A sharp uptick in visits to the page is also telling: a whole lot of people are wondering if Steam is down right now, or if it's just them. It's not just you! Normally we expect a bit of instability from Steam during its routine Tuesday maintenance, but that shouldn't be starting for hours. This is unusual, and we don't know how long Steam will be down.

    "body": "Vampire Survivors is aptly named—because of all the vampire stuff, sure, but more because it stubbornly refuses to die. With an announcement trailer released this morning, Vampire Survivors developer Poncle began a weeks-long teaser rollout to preview the additions of the upcoming 1.14 update, starting with the long-awaited online co-op mode. The teaser begins with a mock Windows 95 desktop—presumably Poe Ratcho's, judging by the constantly rotating head of garlic displayed by an application called \"Garlic.exe.\" After a cursor selects a program that displays a large red button and the text \"Press here for online,\" we get a few glimpses of online Vampire Survivors co-op in action. As you might expect, four players can kill a lot of evil bats. \"Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended,\" Poncle said. \"Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665… More players doesn’t make it easier, or does it?\" We've known online co-op was on its way since it arrived on the Vampire Survivors beta branch back in August, but now we have a better idea of when.

    "body": "TCL has a new 27-inch 4K gaming panel out (via Notebookcheck ), the TCL 27R94 QD-MiniLED Monitor , and you might just need a pair of shades to game with it. That's a teensy exaggeration, of course, but with a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, this is certainly one of the very punchiest gaming panels we've yet seen. It's intriguing for one or two other reasons, too. But let's start with that eye-popping 1,600 brightness rating. This is a mini LED monitor, not an OLED panel and it comes with a VESA DisplayHDR 1400 rating. That means it must be capable of hitting 1,400 nits, full screen. By contrast, pun intended, the brightest OLED monitors are currently rated at 1,300 nits, like the LG Ultragear 45GX950A , but can only achieve that in tiny windows measuring a percentage or two of the whole screen. In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time. Either way, this is one very, very bright monitor. That said, it'…",

I understand those PlayStation folks are enjoying Ghost of Yotei (assuredly PC-bound at some point). Games like Manor Lords, or Hunt: Showdown, or good ol' Crusader Kings also let us live out our dreams of distant and alternate pasts. Problem is, of course, the frogs. Are devs really telling me that, in an age of Unreal Engine 5, lumen and nanite-ified whatevers, game creators can't do better than a frog that's clearly seen an iPhone before? Atrocious stuff, but fear not, because the devs making Hell Let Loose: Vietnam—follow up to 2021's World War 2 shooter that shifts the action to, well, Vietnam—know just how immersion-breaking an anachronistic frog can be. In a chat with PC Gamer magazine, creative director Matt White said the team are taking historical authenticity incredibly seriously. \"All of it is a hundred-percent historically authentic,\" said White, pointing out \"All the uniforms or the weaponry, the environment,\" even \"the clothes you see on the floors\" as being appropriate for the time and place of the game's setting. And you bet that even applies to …",

My clumsy coordination and instant panic the second I sense danger doesn't do me any favours, but I also can't ignore the fact that the dull colour palette which often accompanies some of the best FPS games , is so uninspiring it puts me off playing entirely. I figured this would always be the way, and I'd actively avoid any game that involves me wielding a firearm for the foreseeable future, until the fateful day I saw Don't Stop, Girlypop! on Steam . You could colour any game with various hues and douse it in virtual glitter and heart icons, and it would probably pique my interest in some way or another. Lucky for me, Don't Stop, Girlypop! feeds this insatiable need for all things cute and pink while disguised as an action-packed arena shooter, resulting in me feeling brave enough to actually pick up a game from the genre I've sworn to dislike. Although the demo only whisks you through a portion of the game, it's enough to get a feel for just what awaits you in this frilly, fast-paced shooter. At the start of the demo, you are introduced as Imber, a faceless yet powerful fo…",
