For week seven’s Halloween Night, the Australian conservationist and his dancing partner Witney Carson performed a Tango to “Sweet Dreams are Made of This” by The Hampton String Quartet. In the clip, which can be seen in full below, Irwin, dressed-up like the Prince of Darkness, tangles with Carson on a fog-filled stage before taking the action to the main floor. Staying in theme to the bitter end, Irwin collects himself from the hardwood and is dragged to hell (or backstage) by dark forces, returning to face the judges with his face splattered in fake blood. The judges loved it, as Irwin and Carson collected 38 out of a possible 40 points, their best result yet in the competition which included two perfect 10s. It wasn’t enough, however, to take top spot on the night, as the pair was pipped by Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy with 39/40 . Irwin, the son of the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin, has a fine chance of emulating the success of his older sister Bindi, who won the 21 st &nbsp;season of&nbsp; DWTS , in 2015.

The Fresno, California could “go far on the show,” he remarked. There’s apparently no stopping Edwards, as he shifted gears from that final round of Battles on Monday night, Oct. 27, and leapt into the first wave of Knockouts. Next up, the 30-year-old Team Snoop singer went for the heartstrings with a cover of Ed Sheeran’s “Dive.” Edwards, who proposed to his partner after his Blind Audition, didn’t have any trouble finding the emotional buttons. &#8220;Wow, Ralph,&#8221; coach Niall Horan enthused. &#8220;The stuff that you were doing.
