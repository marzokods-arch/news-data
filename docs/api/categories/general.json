All of life's troubles seem small when your meat tentacles can fling helicopters around.

And now it's gearing up to leave early access, with the 1.0 launch set for October 16 . Unfortunately, the players never really took to it, outside of the diehards. Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped. This month, a big PvP update went live , and it didn't move the needle at all. Since early July, it's been stuck under 1,000 concurrents, and this month it's been averaging around 300.

The Arctis Nova Elite launches today, September 30, for $600/£600/€650. Okay, if you're still with me, let's talk specs.

SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

    "body": "We've been getting drip-fed Resident Evil Requiem information for a few months now, culminating in numerous Leon-centric fan theories, some absolutely terrifying hands-on sessions, and a better look into our new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. The latest crumb being a new story trailer shown at TGS over the weekend. Like most of the content that's come out, this trailer looks suitably terrifying. As Grace and Alyssa search what looks to be yet another Spencer Mansion, they're plagued by unholy beasts and a crusty creep in a raincoat—typical Resident Evil shenanigans. All of which is enough to send me into a bout of anxious excitement, as I picture the mental toll some of these scares are going to have on my fragile psyche. But while I, and anyone else with a working amygdala, can see how terrifying Requiem is going to be, it turns out that the scares are kind of lost on the dev team. \"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it,\" director Koshi Nakanishi says (via IGN ). \"There was actually a bit of a worry internally before we showed the Resident Evil Requiem hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary?

UVHM is an endgame feature that cranks up the difficulty, and despite it being the main goal once you beat the campaign, there's no clear path to progress through the ranks. You'll unlock UVH 1 automatically once you complete the campaign and the short introductory Ultimate Vault Hunter missions, which involve learning about Firmware, tracking down Maurice's Black Market location, and beating a Wildcard Mission. It's heavily tutorialised, but once that's out of the way, you're left to your own devices. So, here's exactly what you need to do to unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter 2 and beyond. How to unlock all Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode ranks in Borderlands 4 There are currently five Ultimate Vault Hunter ranks for you to progress through, with at least one more coming in the first Invincible Boss free content update at the end of the year. To reach a new Ultimate Vault Hunter rank, you need to complete the associated handful of challenges and then beat a Wildcard Mission given to you by Lilith. You can track your progress in th…",

Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story.
