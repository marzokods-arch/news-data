In the latest Steam client beta , Valve announced a handful of changes and fixes, like better Xbox 360 controller mapping in Linux kernel 6.17, fixed timeline markers in game recording, and, most importantly, a new change to chat. Now, when you receive a \"potentially malicious\" message, Valve will add a \"suspicious chat warning that will appear at the top of the chat window.\" Given that Steam launched over two decades ago, and there were millions of dollars put into skins in games like Counter-Strike 2 , it's a bit of a surprise we didn't have this already. Players can emulate others through similar profile pictures or usernames, so it's not out of the question to think bad actors could fake credentials to get access to Steam users. A simple pop-up like this is a good idea for flagging potential bad actors, but it also disables links in chat while the pop-up is available. This means you have to acknowledge the suspicious chat warning to get access to links. Phis…",

Seriously, there are tons. I'll admit, I completely forgot this was a thing once the game had launched, and it's no wonder why, because these songs weren't actually in the game yet, just the credits and trailers. Well, if you've been jonesing for some legendary tracks, the time has come. With the launch of Season 1 , you can now find radios installed in vehicles in both core Battlefield 6 and the Redsec battle royale—just hold 'Q' to open the command wheel and select a station at the top. That's all well and good; you can listen to beats on the move, and there's nothing quite like dodging mines and rocket barrages while peacefully jamming out. However, what I was not expecting was a paywalled radio station. Those who own the Battlefield Pro version of the battle pass, which costs $24.99/£21.99, have access to an exclusive radio station creatively named Battlepass Radio. You guessed it, this paywalled station is home to some of the most iconic tracks of the bu…",

Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

Well, I'd argue it's when you need to strap a bunch of external devices to it in order to get the most out of it, which is exactly what's happened to the Strix Halo-powered OneXPlayer OneXFly Apex . It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight. It's not ju…",

On the one hand, you can save the hostages by completing an elaborate puzzle, but it'll give Wiley more time to accomplish his objectives. On the other hand, you can leave the hostages to their fate—getting squished by a pneumatic press—but you'll reach Wiley faster and might be able to throw a spanner in his schemes. I explain both outcomes below and what the consequences are, but I also run through how to complete the hostage puzzle, including a little video of me doing it in-game.

Once you've collected a lockbox containing an item you like the look of (you can view them all in the hold of your ship), you'll need enough keys to unseal it.

For those in a rush or who are simply stuck, here are the answers to all three of the questions, as well as what you'll get for a reward. The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 .
