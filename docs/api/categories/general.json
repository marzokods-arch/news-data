In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below. I'll also offer some other tips for triumphing against this spear-wielding Takeda clan warrior. After you beat Masakage, you'll complete the prologue section, and be able to enter the rest of the game for real. How to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 Though not all that tricky, Yamagata Masakage definitely requires you to adjust to Nioh 3's combat style, in particular, the Burst Break mechanic. Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away. Burst Break will also change you from Ninja to Samurai or vice versa, though you can tweak this. This attack is easy to recognise since he'…",

If you walk up to these glowing spots, you won't be able to interact with them whatsoever, with the map explaining that you don't have a compatible Guardian Spirit. It's rather annoying as these Spirit Veins prevent you from accessing some of the last activities you've got to tick off in this area, and you'll find even more Spirit Veins later. Below, I'll explain how Spirit Veins work and how to get the compatible Guardian Spirits you need. How to access Spirit Veins in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja There are different types of Spirit Veins, and to use them, you need to unlock the corresponding Guardian Spirit by progressing through the main story. For example, after beating Jakotsu-baba and clearing the Crucible at Hamamatsu Castle, you'll unlock Enko, a fire tiger Guardian Spirit.

Because of this, the Bloodedge Demon can be a terror. But before you can even fight the Bloodedge Demon, you need to know where to find it. You've no doubt prayed at a shrine and been told that the \"Bloodedge Demon has appeared\", but you're not given any clues as to where it is—or even what it is. So, here's what you need to know. Where to find the Bloodedge Demon in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja Team Ninja The Bloodedge Demon spawns periodically throughout your journey, and you'll need to interact with its bloody grave to summon it. This is a large sword surrounded by a purple glow that'll spawn in a random location on the map. You'll know when the Bloodedge Demon is active if you interact with a shrine and are told it's appeared, or if you slay a revenant and it leaves a red trail behind.

Unlike Sekiro, the parry in Nioh 3 is purely defensive in that it doesn't damage enemy Ki (stamina) so it never leads to a stagger and a Grapple attack. It does, however, give you Ki regen and Arts ability energy, letting you be aggressive and deal more damage. It's also more efficient than regular blocking purely in terms of Ki cost If you want to unlock this Samurai ability, you can actually do it almost immediately—in fact, it can be the very first skill you unlock.

The world's most headline-friendly cryptocurrency dropped in value below $70,000 per coin on Thursday for the first time since 2024, with its losses overall this year totalling more than 20 percent. The reasons why are complicated, but famous hedge fund manager Michael Burry has some ideas. You know, the guy portrayed by Christian Bale in 2015's The Big Short . Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ). To understand what's happening here, I need to explain tokenised metals , so strap in. According to information I learned this morning (I have so little interest in crypto it's physically painful), tokenised metals are essentially blockchain representations of assets like gold, platinum and silver. They can be full asset-backed tokens, …",

Roman Hartung who fronts the der8auer channel is also CEO of PC cooling specialist Thermal Grizzly. In that capacity, he's directly involved in buying 12 mm thick copper plates which are used via CNC manufacturing to produce items such as water cooling blocks for graphics cards. Hartung says he attempted to make a routine order for the plates back in October. Normally, the copper plates are shipped out within a few weeks of placing an order. But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks. Today, he says the company would have to pay 280 euros per plate, potentially making the cooling block product non-viable. Hartung points out that in terms of market commodity pricing, copper has increased from $9,000 per tonne a year ago to an all-time…",

With the Maxwell 2, though, Audeze is hoping that it will do exactly that and be the new champion for peerless audio in games. I was certainly expecting it to be something special, as I've been using the Audeze Maxwell on a daily basis, work and gaming, for just over a year (and our hardware overlord-in-chief Dave has been using his set for even longer). Or rather, just like Audeze, I was hoping it would be better, because as much as I really like the Maxwell, there are a few things that really annoy me about it. Let me just cut to the chase, then: Taking all things into account, the Audeze Maxwell 2 isn't unreservedly better than the first-generation Maxwell. It's improved in some areas, but it's regressed in others (or just not improved), and given that it's a little bit more expensive, it's hard to recommend that you buy the Maxwell 2 instead of the original Maxwell. However, if you browse through Audeze's store, you'll notice this has all been made somewhat moot because the OG Maxwell is now mostl…",

I'm also one of those pretentious gits that thinks videogames don't have to be fun to be worth making or playing, though. Very much in the 'it's the point' camp is game director of Nioh 3 Masaki Fujita, who spoke with Eurogamer on the subject this week. In case you're unfamiliar, Nioh 3 is a soulslike action game with an emphasis on skill expression and difficulty. As contributor Lewis Parker puts it in his Nioh 3 review , it has a \"far more fine-tuned and in-depth approach to combat\", more Sekiro than Elden Ring. But that's getting into the weeds a little bit: Point is, it's a bit hard. Fujita tells the site that \"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series.

In a recent chat with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Zelnick pointed out that, look, the company must be confident in the November 19 date, because it's spent all this goshdang money on marketing the game in the lead-up time. \"We have marketing beats coming this summer, and we don't spend money on marketing until we're pretty close to release,\" said Zelnick. To be clear, he means more than just putting out a slick trailer in the tail-end of 2023 . Think ads on buses, billboards, a never-ending feast of GTA 6 imagery jammed in your eyes and ears for months on end. It'll be fun!

YouTube channel Optimum has been using a 32-inch 4K LG WOLED monitor for around 3,000 hours over two years and has found only minor burn-in. This is a particularly handy metric given that one of the best known existing trackers of OLED burn-in by Monitors Unboxed has been based on a monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel . Now we have something similar for LG WOLED. For context, Optimum has been using an LG UltraGear 32GS95UV monitor for a wide range of uses, from gaming to content creation. I think it's a pretty much identical 4K model to the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE I reviewed here , complete with 1080p dual-mode. It's said the panel has been set to between 80% and 100% brightness depending on the time of day. No aggressive measures were taken to alleviate burn-in besides running Windows in dark mode with the taskbar set to autohide. All of the panel protection settings were left in default mode. In practice, that turns out to be just the panel cleaning routine that runs when the monitor is o…",

Her ult is very good, and has a very short cooldown. As soon as you get her ult in the early game, you can start going ham on people.
