Steam appears to be completely gone: The unofficial Steam Status website is reporting websocket errors, and says the entire Steam store, community, and web API are offline. SteamStat page views are also jumping up, which is a pretty reliable indicator that something's gone wrong. That's not good. (Image credit: Unofficial Steam Status) Downdetector is also indicating some serious issues with Steam, ongoing since a little after 1 pm ET. P0nchik95 on the Steam subreddit has a theory—I don't know how likely it is to be accurate (not very, I suspect) but it's not terrible advice anyway: Comment from r/Steam We've reached out to Valve to see if they've got anything to say about it, and will keep an eye on things in the meantime.

Importantly, this one isn't quite so subjective as most 'best of' collections because it reflects something that's really important in PC gaming: performance . I don't just mean outright frame rates, though that's no small matter. You can have a game that runs at well over 200 fps, but if the graphics are all wonky donkey, or the whole thing is less stable than a block-away-from-disaster game of Jenga, then it'll be no fun to play. Over the past 12 months, we've dug deep into the performance, graphics, and development quality of 13 games released this year. The majority of these, plus many others that we've played and tested (but not done a full analysis of), were basically fine: not great, not bad, merely okay. (Image credit: Obsidian) But three stood out for being shining examples of brilliant game development, from a technical perspective.

There's something fascinating about taking an artefact you're intensely familiar with and filtering it through the lens of a different culture, philosophy, and language. The same, I must presume, applies to videogame names. Or at least, that's the gossamer-thin justification I concocted to take 12 game names, filter them through 25 layers of Google Translate, and turn the results into a quiz. I've taken the (English) names of 12 reasonably well-known videogames and plugged them into machine translation. Then I did it again. Then again. And again. And again. From English, through Yiddish, Punjabi, Mandarin, Yoruba… on and on it went, until the final translation—back into English—returned something that really bears very little resemblance to the game's original name at all.

Highlights include a 32-inch 6K model with glasses-free 3D support, plus a 1080p panel with 1,040 Hz refresh. The latter notably, if marginally, pips Philips and AOC's new 1,000 Hz gaming monitors to the high-refresh prize. But let's start with that 6K beauty. The new Samsung Odyssey 3D G9 G90XH is a 32 incher. Resolution-wise, it's the same 6,144 by 3,456 pixels as some existing 6K monitors, like the LG UltraFine Evo 32U990A-S . However, where that LG tops out at 60 Hz, the Samsung Odyssey 3D is good for 165 Hz at native 6K. It also offers an alternate 330 Hz mode running at 3K. In theory, that means the 330 Hz mode is an integer scale of 6K, so the image quality could be quite good. Intriguingly, it uses an IPS panel, not the VA tech that Samsung is known for. Response is quoted at 1 ms GtG. As if all that wasn't enough, and as its name suggests, the Samsung Odyssey 3D sports glasses-free 3D tech with eye tracking. I reviewed this kind of technology before, albeit on an Acer monitor, the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 , and not come away entirely convinced. In this context, m…",

But while CD Projekt is now full steam ahead on The Witcher 4 , there are rumblings—not much more than vibrations, really—of something new coming for Witcher 3. Ears pricked up following a Strefa Inwestorów report ( Google translated ) quoting Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicting a Witcher 3 expansion for May 2026. \"We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026,\" Chrzanowski said. \"We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million ($14.5 million). The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.\" That's not a whole lot to go on, but it does make sense. Chrzanowski also said he expects The Witcher 4 to launch in Q4 2027, which puts it in the admittedly massively open-ended time frame of 'not until after 2026' previously shared by CD Projekt. New Witcher 3 DLC would also be a guaranteed moneymaker. Some quick napkin math: CD Projekt has now sold more than 60 million copies, and if we assume a DL…",

Today I learned that it also does damage, and someone is currently trying to beat the entire game with it, because of course they are. YouTube user Bloblumordthe3rd calls the playthrough \"Garama%\" and releases a new video every week or so showing off their progress. They are by no means racing through the game with an ability that can only be barely described as lethal: Every fight takes ages as they patiently wait for the best moment to Garama! It took two hours of attempts to defeat the final boss of act 1, for example.

He'd go on to co-found Infinity Ward with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002, which not only created Call of Duty but reinvented it (and mainstream shooters more widely) with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. After a split with Activision Zampella and West co-founded Respawn, which has released the beloved Titanfall games, Apex Legends, and two Star Wars Jedi games.

As I said in my Keep Driving review , I grew up in the US in a town that had—like many towns in the US—no real public transportation, so my first taste of real freedom was when I got my first car, a heavily used hand-me-down green Plymouth Horizon hatchback. I loved that clunky car, mostly because of what it represented: a chance to escape my house and my town and set out on the road with no real destination, only occasionally checking the map, blasting music, and paying for gas a few dollars at a time. Gotta save some cash for snacks.

There's a lot to love about its depiction of post-nuclear Boston if you're willing to overlook the fact that you solve most problems with a gun. One aspect of Fallout 4 I haven't considered much, however, is its replayability. But it's a point that design director Emil Pagliarulo feels strongly about, as he recently discussed. Speaking to GamesRadar , Pagliarulo explained how he believed the RPGs interweaving questlines—whereby the factions you support affect the choices available to you in the main quest—make it the most replayable Fallout game. Pagliarulo began explaining his position by talking about Fallout 3 . \"The interesting thing about Fallout 3 is there are no faction quests,\" Pagliarulo observed, a fact which separates Bethesda's first stab at Fallout from its Elder Scrolls RPGs. \"For Fallout 4, it was the first time we said, 'You play Skyrim and you play these factions, but they're disconnected from …",

Last week I was: Coping a little about Hades 2. 2025 was a bloody year for MMORPGs as a genre. And by bloody, I actually mean catastrophic: New World announced it'd be closing, Greg Street's MMO had its funding pulled , that ZeniMax game was killed before it could even hit the market, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled . But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down. Yet there's trouble in paradise: In a fascinating bit of coincidence , both World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 are in for a very interesting 2026 (and beyond). How either game is handled in this fateful year will set the tone for years to come. Turning that ship around Final Fantasy 14 has, as I and my fellow FF14 enjoyer Mollie Taylor have often said on this website, been in a weird state .…",

On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for. As a reminder, The Blood of Dawnwalker is being made by Rebel Wolves, a Polish studio founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. If you're not familiar with Tomaszkiewicz's name, he was director of a little game called The Witcher 3 . And get this, Tom…",

As reported by TheGamer , Five Nights at Freddy's 2 currently stands as one of the worst-rated movie releases of 2025. That's right, it's not just a terrible adaptation, it's seemingly a terrible movie full stop. It's currently positioned as the third worst film out of the 429 with more than seven critic reviews on Metacritic this year, with a measly aggregation of just 26 out of 100. It's only three points better than Bride Hard but still miles (20 points) better than the current worst-rated film of the year—War of the Worlds, which from what I have been told is an awful lot of Ice Cube staring at screens peppered in with some not-so-subtle Amazon product placement.

The game received two new expansions which introduced player-created freelance missions and an overhauled mining experience, as five new ships. CCP's stats suggest these expansions went down well. Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims. The number that really stood out to me, however, is how much ISK—EVE's in-game currency—was incinerated in the course of all this destruction. According to CCP, that number totals 1,142,260,784,813,930 ISK. That's more than one quadrillion ISK that went up in flames over the last twelve months. More than 10 to the power 15, or, as I prefer to think of it, an absolute shedload. I was curious what the real-dollar value of this massive amount of ISK might be, so I had a go at figuring it out.

It's big and roomy and weighs a ton, with enough glass to satisfy your curiosity about what's going on inside and three light-up fans on the front to look good. There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk.
