On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for. As a reminder, The Blood of Dawnwalker is being made by Rebel Wolves, a Polish studio founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. If you're not familiar with Tomaszkiewicz's name, he was director of a little game called The Witcher 3 . And get this, Tom…",

Last week I was: Coping a little about Hades 2. 2025 was a bloody year for MMORPGs as a genre. And by bloody, I actually mean catastrophic: New World announced it'd be closing, Greg Street's MMO had its funding pulled , that ZeniMax game was killed before it could even hit the market, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled . But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down. Yet there's trouble in paradise: In a fascinating bit of coincidence , both World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 are in for a very interesting 2026 (and beyond). How either game is handled in this fateful year will set the tone for years to come.

And the mascot standing strong as the representative of bad videogame movies is none other than Freddy Fazbear himself. As reported by TheGamer , Five Nights at Freddy's 2 currently stands as one of the worst-rated movie releases of 2025. That's right, it's not just a terrible adaptation, it's seemingly a terrible movie full stop. It's currently positioned as the third worst film out of the 429 with more than seven critic reviews on Metacritic this year, with a measly aggregation of just 26 out of 100. It's only three points better than Bride Hard but still miles (20 points) better than the current worst-rated film of the year—War of the Worlds, which from what I have been told is an awful lot of Ice Cube staring at screens peppered in with some not-so-subtle Amazon product placement.

The game received two new expansions which introduced player-created freelance missions and an overhauled mining experience, as five new ships. CCP's stats suggest these expansions went down well. Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims. The number that really stood out to me, however, is how much ISK—EVE's in-game currency—was incinerated in the course of all this destruction. According to CCP, that number totals 1,142,260,784,813,930 ISK. That's more than one quadrillion ISK that went up in flames over the last twelve months. More than 10 to the power 15, or, as I prefer to think of it, an absolute shedload. I was curious what the real-dollar value of this massive amount of ISK might be, so I had a go at figuring it out.

They spark up a cigarette. I spark up a cigarette. Another man in sunglasses and a cowboy hat standing besides us sparks a cigarette. The man behind tells me to \"punch it\" and we begin our descent down a huge wonky wooden ramp, accelerating in our RV toward a plunge into a gorge and near-certain death. We make it. As does the RV. Just. It no longer has doors, bumpers, hood, roof, ladder, windows, and the wheels are falling off. We collectively toke on our cigarettes, toss 'em, then spark up some fresh cigs. This is RV There Yet? A game that's determined to drive me up the wall, figuratively, for including a question mark in the name, and literally, because it's a game about driving a recreational vehicle over big rocks.

But the team is just getting started. \"2025 was more of a warm-up period for us,\" Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo told Den of Geek . \"Next year, we're going to have bigger plans. We're not going to slow down. We've already planned more than a year ahead and I can't wait for our players to see it.\" I've been ruthlessly cutting live service games out of my library this month, as the dopamine hit from the endless progression is no longer justifying all the cracking traditional singleplayer games that have fallen by the wayside. So I'm on a Marvel Rivals break at the moment, but I sure played a lot of it this year. I went from being more than a sceptic, hating how it felt to play and what NetEase had done to some of my favourite characters, like Magneto , to becoming a convert.

It's heavy and awkward too, but that's the price you pay for having everything you need in a gaming PC as well as proper airflow. Acer's case for the 2025 Predator Orion 7000 is an excellent example of the type. It's big and roomy and weighs a ton, with enough glass to satisfy your curiosity about what's going on inside and three light-up fans on the front to look good. There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk.

It's primarily designed for mid-core players, he says: People who like to seek out a challenge in open-world content and the solo-dungeon style encounters of Delves. But the difficulty of Prey ramps up quickly, and top-end encounters should provide challenges even for mythic-geared raiders, should they decide to become the hunted. \"Prey is inherently an overlay system,\" Smith says. \"So regardless of the content you engage with in the open world, you will also be dealing with Prey.\" Pick your target and become the hunted (Image credit: Sykeen / Blizzard Entertainment) Players interact with an NPC in Silvermoon city to pick their difficulty, zone, and target from a collection of 30 bosses.

The Arcane Pickaxe is available in Stonewake's Cross, but you'll need to navigate through the deepest depths of the first zone's cave to get your hands on it. It's not a quest I'd suggest rushing, even if you help the Bard find his lost instrument early on. The higher level zombies really take a bite out of your HP in bigger mobs. How to get the Arcane Pickaxe in The Forge You can get the Arcane Pickaxe for $125,000 in The Cave, the first zone's mining spot, after completing the Bard's lost guitar quest. It's easy to complete in just a few minutes when you know where to look, but making use of the Bard's Unknown Key takes patience. It's not worth proceeding if you don't have the cash, and I wound up waiting until I was on the last Goblin King quest before going back to buy the pickaxe.

Behind the scenes, developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were desperately trying to save the project, but these efforts would come to naught: a last-ditch attempt involving publisher Take-Two collapsed when no agreement could be reached over the IP rights .

The style kickstarted back in gay Supernatural fanfiction circles and has since spun off into a huge subsection of manga and manhwa while still remaining popular in written fanfiction. The whole thing riffs heavily off how we viewed wolf dynamics for years—huamns born as alphas, betas, or omegas; the latter emitting pheromones that can make the former uncontrollably horny et cetera—and in the vast majority of cases is very much a male-on-male thing.

But the one game that really stood out for me is the one game that I really shouldn't like: Grounded 2 . Given that I played the first Grounded for around 110 hours, this might seem like a bit of a silly thing to say. I'm certainly not some kind of gaming masochist (though my 2,030 hours in Hearts of Iron 4 would suggest otherwise), so I clearly enjoyed the first game, and thus it's only logical I would love the sequel.
