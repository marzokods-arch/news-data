Black Ops 7 perks function much like they did in last year's Black Ops 6: Pick three from a huge pool of bonuses, either ignoring or targeting a \"combat speciality\" bonus for using perks of the same type. The big change to perks this year is the addition of hybrid specialities, alternative bonuses to the three main combat specialities that let you mix and match perk types a bit. There are also more perks at launch than last year (27 vs 21) and some existing ones have moved around tiers, but if you got comfortable with perk combinations in Blops 6, most of them will still work the same in Blops 7. There are three perk types: Offense (red), Stealth (Blue), and Support (Green). In Blops 6, these categories were called Enforcer, Recon, and Strategist to match their associated combat specialties, but now that hybrid specialities are a thing, they were given generic names. Here's the full list of perks that we know about so far in Black Ops 7 as they exist in the open beta.

Megabonk almost didn't look real at first: Its aesthetic is like some kind of 3D asset nightmare where skeletons pop into Mario coins and a fox wizard shoots fireballs at Piggsy from Manhunt. It's a crude mixture of pixel art and chunky 3D models that wouldn't look out of place on a TV in the background of an episode of NCIS. But despite the assault on my eyeballs, Megabonk is a coherent, surprisingly cerebral auto-shooter roguelike in the style of Vampire Survivors. Even the creator, Vedinad, calls it \"Vampire Survivors but 3D\" in a YouTube video about its inception. You mow through waves of enemies until you die or defeat the boss, discovering all sorts of weird upgrades along the way.

That means The Protomen spent two more years tinkering on Act 3, the third part of their Mega Man-inspired rock opera saga, than Duke Nukem Forever was in development. Valve shipped Half-Life: Alyx three years faster. George R.R. Martin still has almost two years to finish The Winds of Winter more quickly than this album.

When I first played the demo in May, I shared how I was getting to a point where I felt exhausted with decorating in games because of a little voice telling me it needed to be picture-perfect.

The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",

It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober! Warhammer Bundle is a mix of genres, so you may not find everything here to your liking: Inquisitor—Martyr, for instance, is an action RPG, while Vermintide 2 is a co-op shooter and Dakka Squadron is kind of an arcade …",

In a new trailer , developers Scumhead and Osiol have revealed that we don't have long to wait for the full game: Mohrta will release on Steam October 14 . There are so many new FPSes (and indie games in general) with retro throwback graphics and strange, \"you won't find this in triple-A\" art styles that it's harder than ever to stand out from the crowd. But Mohrta still caught my eye and won't let go. You play as some kind of interdimensional killing machine, an (allegedly) unfeeling assassin in head-to-toe armor that's part Jin-Roh, part Trench Crusade. Their face is covered by a gas mask under a wide-brimmed helmet like a British WWI soldier, but the rest of the ensemble is all plate mail, and they carry an assortment of both medieval and modern weaponry. The demo showed off the sword, a fast-firing pistol, and a classic trench gun-style shotgun, while the trailers have previewed stranger fare like playing cards you throw like shuriken, a pile bunker , or dual flails. Mohrta boasts a unique, decidedly un-Doom …",

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and EGS general manager Steve Allison both acknowledged in May of this year that the Epic Store sucks—or, as Allison put it more politically, that \"t…",

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

Anything too obviously keen to impress, too overbearing in its affect, is intolerable whether quality or not. We want sprezzatura, elegance, and honesty, not to be hit over the head by someone very clearly trying to extract some very specific emotion. This is what I thought about as I played some Hotel Barcelona earlier today, which possibly tells you everything you need to know right there. A collab between outre auteurs Swery and Suda51, Hotel Barcelona should be right up my alley. I love Deadly Premonition (Swery), I enjoyed Flower, Sun, and Rain (Suda)—these are two great tastes that should taste great together. (Image credit: CULT Games) Instead, I mostly found my time with the game exhausting. Hotel Barcelona puts you in the shoes of Justine, a US marshal who shares her body with the soul of a serial killer, as she repeatedly murders her way through a bunch of monsters. This should not, ordinarily, be her job, but the guy whose job it was died when Justine crashed the car carrying them both at the game's start, so here we are.

I played a ton of it in 2022, turning my struggling medieval town into a profitable city thanks to investing heavily in bees—only to have my waxy fortune stolen by bandits in a suspiciously well-timed heist . Farthest Frontier also has a surprisingly deep farming system involving crop rotation and soil fertility, seasonal weather that will have you dreading those bitter and dangerous winters, and a whole host of horrible diseases and afflictions your settlers will have to contend with, like dysentery, scurvy, typhoid, cholera, frostbite, rabies, and even the plague.
