This is our first actual scene from the season and not a little teaser, though, with Hemsworth sporting the white locks and leather armor of everyone's favorite mutant monster slayer. The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom. Rounding out some fun deployment of Witcher signs, Geralt lures the thing into a Yrden trap so he can actually harm it⁠, and finishes it off by tearing out its heart a…",

I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot.

Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures.

To September 18. \"Seeing the excitement from our community for the return of Kyle Crane in Dying Light: The Beast,\" said franchise director Tymon Smektała, \"and knowing the game is ready, we wanted to do something special for our players. We pushed ourselves to make the impossible possible, and that's why we’re releasing the game a little earlier. I can't wait to see players' reactions when they finally step into the world of The Beast.\" More than a million players have pre-ordered Dying Light: The Beast, and Techland is eager to keep them happy. They and anyone else who pre-orders has been promised \"an exclusive new reward\", though what that reward is they haven't said. It'll apparently be revealed during launch week.

Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one. Unfortunately for BioShock fans, that means Lawrence has his hands full for the time being. Filming for a movie like Sunrise on the Reaping can take …",

Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire.

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta.

Which, if you've been paying attention to the game's ability to self-immolate, is truly something. And yet Bungie still seems determined to find new ways to take Ls. This time, it's the greed again. The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas. The disappointing walkback from \"incredibly cool\" to old hand-me-down was a bummer for players looking for new drip. The real trouble, though, began when concept artist …",
