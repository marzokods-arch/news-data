In fact, in some ways it was more daring and ambitious than its bigger, beardier brother. Most notably, none of the decisions you make in the Witcher 3 are as momentous as the game-changing choice at the heart The Witcher 2, where choosing to help one of two characters in a fight led to a second act viewed from completely different perspectives. Roughly 90% of The Witcher 2's second-act strands are unique, each with its own locations, key characters, and quests. I've always wondered if CD Projekt will commit so wholly to an in-game decision again. But according to CD Projekt's co-CEO Adam Badowski, such an eventuality is unlikely. Speaking to PC Gamer, Badowski discussed the changes CD Projekt made between The Witcher 2 and 3, noting that the biggest of these was structural. \"In The Witcher 2, we had a very difficult structure of the game, because there are two paths. You can go one path and you won't see the other path,\" he says. \"From the production perspective it's a waste of resources. From [the] player's perspective, it…",

And not everyone was convinced a story-driven open world was going to work. \"That was the biggest challenge back then,\" Adam Badowski, CD Projekt's joint CEO, tells us. \"Because you know, right now, it's pretty obvious for us that we can combine storytelling and a cinematic experience with the open world, but back then, it was huge. I mean, for us, for the industry.

If only I'd fallen into literally any of the massive bodies of water available, I would have survived. And it would have all been thanks to CD Projekt's joint CEO Adam Badowski. \"I remember the moment when I asked a very difficult question [that felt] obvious to me,\" explains Badowski, \"there's water, [but] where's swimming? The whole room was quiet.\" The team's main concern was that \"they thought we'd need to cut something, so we didn't need to have swimming\". Thankfully this wasn't the case. (Image credit: CDPR) Swimming is often quite a contentious mechanic , you either loathe it or deal with it, and I personally think it's only truly enjoyable when it's a game's sole focus like in Abzu.

I had a good amount of fun with Stellar Blade myself— even if I found it a little uninspired in the face of similar concepts. But when it comes to Korean developers breaking out beyond niche MMOs and mobile games, I can't deny that Stellar Blade is one of the forerunners in broadening the region's reach. (Image credit: M Bowles via Getty Images) It's something that Yoshida agrees with, and even reckons that the game's success has bolstered spirits among Korean game developers, particularly when it comes to developing console games. As spotted by GamesRadar (via MiniMap ), the ex-PlayStation boss sat down with press ahead of game development conference G-Star to chat about the Korean indie scene, the role larger corporations play in helping them to thrive, and other console-y related bits. When asked about how the collaboration with Stellar Blade came about, Yoshida said: \"I visited …",

    "body": "Bethesda released a Creations Bundle for Fallout 4 yesterday as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations, adding 150 player-created items for the not-so-low price of £17.99. Unfortunately, Bethesda appears to have dropped the birthday cake on its way to the party, as players report some pretty serious issues with the Creation Bundle and its contents. At the time of writing, Fallout 4—Creations Bundle sat at a \"Mostly Negative\" Steam rating with 124 reviews—quite a lot for what is essentially an asset pack. While some of the reviews complain about the price and the pack's content—which is apparently a repackaging of items that were already available on the Creations Store—the bulk of the complaints lament that the pack doesn't actually work. \"Game absolutely refuses to let you attempt to install anything involving the Creation Club and freezes upon launching and quitting the game to the point where you can't even use Task Manager or Steam to force close,\" writes Steam user HemlokGaming . Meanwhile, grimengine states that the Creation Bundle \"actually made the game buggier, and somehow makes the game crash PC-breakingly hard when trying to do the simple action of closing the game.…",

I remember the furore when everyone discovered Henry Cavill was a PC gamer, for instance. So I have certainly noticed Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, because Jacob Elordi, the actor who plays Frankenstein's monster in the new Netflix movie, likes to pass the time by gaming on his Steam Deck . In the Netflix promo material showing Elordi transforming into 'The Creature' for the role, we can see him busting out a Steam Deck to pass the time on, in addition to checking his phone and reading. Apparently, the transformation into Frankie's creature took 10 hours , so bringing a Deck to the makeup/SFX seat was certainly prudent.

Yup, this 27-inch, 1440p gaming monitor packs the very latest 4th gen Samsung QD-OLED panel technology. A new generation of OLED panel is always exciting, but how much of an upgrade is it over the best currently available OLED monitors ? Does it fix OLED's full-screen brightness limitations? What about QD-OLED's specific problems with ambient light and font rendering? What does a 500 Hz OLED actually look like set to full reheat? Hold those thoughts while we cover off this new display's various speeds and feeds. Along with the lofty 500 Hz refresh and 2,560 by 1,440 native resolution, you get OLED's characteristic uber-low response times, which come in at a claimed 0.03 ms. No question, this thing is built for speed. It's also engineered to be brighter than previous displays that rely on Samsung's QD-OLED technology. Right at the beginning of the year at the CES show, Samsung unveiled the next step in its QD-OLED roadmap .

While there are arguably more ergonomic options on the market, or simply ones with more gaming features, the Freestyle Edge is a near-perfect blend of comfort, performance, and price tag. Well, it's back again, this time in the form of a small update: the Freestyle Edge RGB Plus . When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps. These used to be optional extras (and quite pricey, too), but now they're included in the box.

Something I didn't get too deeply into when I gushed about Tavern Keeper last week is its item design tool. There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table.

Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad.

That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode.

The Japanese publisher dipped its toes back in with Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 1 in 2023, which after a year of patches turned out pretty good , before this year brought the excellent remake Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater . Now it's announced a new collaboration with Team Jade's F2P tactical shooter Delta Force that will see David Hayter once more voicing Naked Snake (MGS Delta's protagonist). Delta Force is a decent Battlefield-style shooter that PCG's Morgan Park liked well enough, even if the monetisation feels like staring into the void . \"I myself am a big fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise, like many developers from our team, because we grew up playing this series,\" says Delta Force Game Director Shadow Guo . \"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is one of my favorite installments, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is such a wonderful way to revisit a classic.\" Guo adds that \"the theme and genre of Metal Gear Solid is just right for our game\", Naked Snake is \"a very iconic character\", and says the collaboration came about because of Delta's release.

Not only that, but SlimX has also made a mod restoring the scene available for free on his Patreon . Have you ever wondered why Arabella calls Withers \"Bone Man?\" Me either. He is a Man very self evidently made of Bones, so we're not exactly solving a riddle for the ages here. Still, Arabella's patter with Withers is a charming, unexpected bit of writing that punches above its weight in shading more depth into both characters: Withers clearly has a soft spot for children, and Arabella has no problem chopping it up with an immortal watcher. Seeing more of that relationship is certainly welcome. After finding Arabella's dead parents but before telling her about their fate, she was supposed to have a brief back-and-forth with Withers at the party camp where she tweaks his nose and settles on the Bone Man nickname. \"I am not a 'skellie,' thou shalt call me Withers,\" the reluctant avatar of cosmic judgement peevishly intones. \"'Withers?'

Contained in a 3D printed, plastic shell spray painted an authentic shade of yellow that harkens back to its forebears, the homebrew handheld even features a Logitech rollerball mouse (via Hackaday ). As for mouse clicks , those are tied to a lonely little trigger button on the top right-hand corner of the console. It's a control scheme that looks as nightmarish as it is extra, but that's not the most interesting facet of the project. Given how svelte APU chips have to be to fit inside even the bulkiest of today's best handheld gaming PCs , it's worth remembering how bulky 90s desktop mainboards used to be—so, how does this throwback build achieve such a reasonable form factor?

The anniversary has got Bethesda creative chief Todd Howard in a reflective mood, and he's revealed some interesting details about the creation of the game and what the RPG maestros learned from it. One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way.\" Elaborating on why the dialogue system didn't resonate, Howard explained …",

Well, great news: in a recent chat with GQ , Bethesda big boss Todd Howard said that \"The Elder Scrolls 6 is the everyday thing\" that its devs are working on right now. Howard says likes to have a \"break\" between Elder Scrolls games—to avoid them becoming rote and predictable—but admits that while \"It’s also good for an audience to have a break—The Elder Scrolls has been too long.\" Boy, has it—it has been, for those not keeping track, a full 14 years since Skyrim first released, which was itself a mere five years after Oblivion.
