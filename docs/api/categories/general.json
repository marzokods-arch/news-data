However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Cynthia Erivo is fresh off her run as Elphaba in the blockbuster hit that was the Wicked films, and she&rsquo;s ready to talk about it. It&rsquo;s clear to see that the duology was a major hit, especially the music. The first Wicked film soundtrack made history by debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, the highest opening for a stage-to-screen adaptation. It also topped our Top Album Sales, Soundtracks and Vinyl Albums charts simultaneously. Seven songs from the soundtrack topped the Billboard Hot 100, including Erivo&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Defying Gravity,&rdquo; being the highest charting at No. 44. Following her stellar performance as the Wicked Witch of the West, she&rsquo;s giving a peek at her process for prepping for the film duology her new book, Simply More: A Book for Anyone Who Has Been Told They&rsquo;re Too Much .

    "summary": "Did you know that Muni Long wrote these bangers?",
    "body": "While everyone may know Muni Long as the Grammy-award winning R&amp;B star, she actually got her start in the music industry as a prominent songwriter. As told in a sprawling interview with Billboard , the singer known as Priscilla Renea struggled to get her solo career off the ground when she started in 2009. She dropped her Jukebox debut that didn&#8217;t chart at all, and before returning to her own music for a second album in 2018, dipped heavily into her songwriting bag. While she&#8217;d eventually rebrand herself as Muni Long and strike gold with her swooning love song &#8220;Hrs and Hrs&#8221; in 2021, Grammy-winning executive producer Christopher “Tricky” Stewart described her as &#8220;a professional song assassin&#8221; during her time penning other people&#8217;s tracks. “I started writing songs to make money because I bought into the [idea of] ‘Well, if you write enough hits, then you can be an artist,’ ” Muni Long told Billboard . “I gave it my all… I did so much free work, got stolen from and taken ­advantage of so many times, so many bad deals. I’d also been the only Black person in the room writing all these pop songs for years. So I quit to focus on me… keeping t…",

This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 213, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 39-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week.

Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",
