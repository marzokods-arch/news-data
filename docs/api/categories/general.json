One product stands out to me in a sea of increasingly expensive components. It's the Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro , and here's why. I first caught sight of the Liquid Freezer III Pro at Computex, Taiwan's biggest tech show. I arrived at Arctic's booth in a bit of a mess, having essentially jogged between appointments most of the morning in the stuffy weather. I spent an undue amount of time admiring the new Liquid Freezer Pro, if only for a brief respite as the cool air from its fans reached my face.

We serve a wide range of drinks and snacks, from reasonably priced wine and ale to skewers of ethically sourced meats (the source is an ogre and he seems very above board), host live music and any comedians who haven't been cancelled yet, and thanks to my business acumen we are absolutely rolling in it. But this isn't why I'm so proud of my little business.

In 2025, as graphics cards, memory, and storage have become harder to find at reasonable prices, monitors have only become better value. So, should you have the rig to run it, there has never been a better time to upgrade to a 4K screen. Philips remains in good form, with its Evnia 27M2N3800A being arguably the best-priced 4K panel we've seen (and with a neat dual resolution mode). MSI just barely missed out on a nomination for its 271QR OLED monitor , which is a bright and super snappy panel. Acer, Asus, LG, and AOC all had strong showings this year, too, but in such a packed year, you need to pick just a handful and the Alienware and KTC below just managed to beat them out. Our Alienware pick is super quick, with a gorgeous HDR QD-OLED panel. The KTC monitor is a bit of an underdog without the recognisable name of Philips or Alienware, yet it's still a punchy, quick and affordable 1440p panel.

One warning : There are images in this quiz, and while there's nothing X or even R-rated, a couple images are a mildly saucy, so don't start the quiz if Mom is looking over your shoulder, unless Mom is a modern woman who doesn't blanch at seeing a cartoon elf with a little cleavage.

With Nvidia releasing a whole new generation of graphics chips (and you can bet I've been testing a ton of those as well...), the best gaming laptop manufacturers have been hard at work either respinning their old machines to make way for the new GPU silicon, or completely redesigning their laptop chassis for a new year. And the very first one to land in my lap this year was definitely the latter, with the Razer Blade 16 popping up with a new design intent on taking the crown back from Asus. The ROG Zephyrus G16 was the hands-down winner last year, with a mix of stylish, slimline chassis and impressive gaming performance, while Razer's finest of 2024 looked bloated by comparison. Not so this year, as the Blade 16 is our first nomination for the best notebook of 2025.

Importantly, this one isn't quite so subjective as most 'best of' collections because it reflects something that's really important in PC gaming: performance . I don't just mean outright frame rates, though that's no small matter. You can have a game that runs at well over 200 fps, but if the graphics are all wonky donkey, or the whole thing is less stable than a block-away-from-disaster game of Jenga, then it'll be no fun to play. Over the past 12 months, we've dug deep into the performance, graphics, and development quality of 13 games released this year. The majority of these, plus many others that we've played and tested (but not done a full analysis of), were basically fine: not great, not bad, merely okay.

I think one of my favourite things—just, generally—are the old Soviet film posters for Star Wars . There's something fascinating about taking an artefact you're intensely familiar with and filtering it through the lens of a different culture, philosophy, and language. The same, I must presume, applies to videogame names. Or at least, that's the gossamer-thin justification I concocted to take 12 game names, filter them through 25 layers of Google Translate, and turn the results into a quiz. I've taken the (English) names of 12 reasonably well-known videogames and plugged them into machine translation. Then I did it again. Then again. And again. And again. From English, through Yiddish, Punjabi, Mandarin, Yoruba… on and on it went, until the final translation—back into English—returned something that really bears very little resemblance to the game's original name at all.

Highlights include a 32-inch 6K model with glasses-free 3D support, plus a 1080p panel with 1,040 Hz refresh. The latter notably, if marginally, pips Philips and AOC's new 1,000 Hz gaming monitors to the high-refresh prize. But let's start with that 6K beauty. The new Samsung Odyssey 3D G9 G90XH is a 32 incher. Resolution-wise, it's the same 6,144 by 3,456 pixels as some existing 6K monitors, like the LG UltraFine Evo 32U990A-S . However, where that LG tops out at 60 Hz, the Samsung Odyssey 3D is good for 165 Hz at native 6K. It also offers an alternate 330 Hz mode running at 3K. In theory, that means the 330 Hz mode is an integer scale of 6K, so the image quality could be quite good. Intriguingly, it uses an IPS panel, not the VA tech that Samsung is known for. Response is quoted at 1 ms GtG. As if all that wasn't enough, and as its name suggests, the Samsung Odyssey 3D sports glasses-free 3D tech with eye tracking. I reviewed this kind of technology before, albeit on an Acer monitor, the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 , and not come away entirely convinced. In this context, m…",

Ears pricked up following a Strefa Inwestorów report ( Google translated ) quoting Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicting a Witcher 3 expansion for May 2026. \"We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026,\" Chrzanowski said. \"We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million ($14.5 million). The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.\" That's not a whole lot to go on, but it does make sense. Chrzanowski also said he expects The Witcher 4 to launch in Q4 2027, which puts it in the admittedly massively open-ended time frame of 'not until after 2026' previously shared by CD Projekt. New Witcher 3 DLC would also be a guaranteed moneymaker. Some quick napkin math: CD Projekt has now sold more than 60 million copies, and if we assume a DL…",

Sajam has served as one of the biggest bridges between the fighting game community and the larger mainstream videogame space over the last several years alongside other figures like Maximilian Dood. His presence at EVO has been a given up to this point, but that won't be the case any longer. In a 12-minute segment from a recent livestream , Sajam explained that he will no longer be attending EVO events after it was revealed in September that the organization had been bought by the Saudi Arabian government. \"You know, I've been going to EVO since 2014 and I'm not going now because of the buyout,\" he started. And before you type anything, I'm like 'Yeah man, if the US Army bought EVO I would also not go.'\" Preempting that folks might also begin citing that \"there's a lotta evil corporations out there,\" Sajam retorted: \"Evil corporations purchasing or owning the things you like always sucks.

As I said in my Keep Driving review , I grew up in the US in a town that had—like many towns in the US—no real public transportation, so my first taste of real freedom was when I got my first car, a heavily used hand-me-down green Plymouth Horizon hatchback. I loved that clunky car, mostly because of what it represented: a chance to escape my house and my town and set out on the road with no real destination, only occasionally checking the map, blasting music, and paying for gas a few dollars at a time. Gotta save some cash for snacks. Keep Driving delivers impeccable vibes from a time when the stress of school was slowly being replaced by the clawing panic of having to figure out what comes after school. A real job. Re…",

There's a lot to love about its depiction of post-nuclear Boston if you're willing to overlook the fact that you solve most problems with a gun. One aspect of Fallout 4 I haven't considered much, however, is its replayability. But it's a point that design director Emil Pagliarulo feels strongly about, as he recently discussed. Speaking to GamesRadar , Pagliarulo explained how he believed the RPGs interweaving questlines—whereby the factions you support affect the choices available to you in the main quest—make it the most replayable Fallout game. Pagliarulo began explaining his position by talking about Fallout 3 . \"The interesting thing about Fallout 3 is there are no faction quests,\" Pagliarulo observed, a fact which separates Bethesda's first stab at Fallout from its Elder Scrolls RPGs. \"For Fallout 4, it was the first time we said, 'You play Skyrim and you play these factions, but they're disconnected from …",

But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down.

On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for.

Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims. The number that really stood out to me, however, is how much ISK—EVE's in-game currency—was incinerated in the course of all this destruction. According to CCP, that number totals 1,142,260,784,813,930 ISK. That's more than one quadrillion ISK that went up in flames over the last twelve months.

There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk.

For some (definitely not talking about myself here, just, you know, some people ) the announcement was especially exciting because it also provided us (sorry, them ) with an opportunity to remind the world that we liked Larian before Larian was cool. Larian was cool way back when, but mostly among RPG nerds. You may recall that the studio was relying on crowdfunding campaigns as recently Divinity: Original Sin 2, its pre-Baldur's Gate 3 release. For those of you who are relatively new to the scene—that is, if you discovered Larian through BG3—well, Larian boss Swen Vincke thinks it might be best if you start with the Original Sins (or maybe just don't brother at all). \"If you play [the Divinity: Original Sin games] you will see things in this Divinity that reference those two,\" Vincke told GamesRadar . \"If you played the first Divinity, you will see it referenced properly inside of this Divinity.
