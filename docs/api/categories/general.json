    "body": "There's no shortage of strong SMGs in Battlefield 6 . In fact, it's generally the most consistent weapon type at close and medium range (way further out than they should be, really), almost invalidating assault rifles. While that's not quite where the best SCW-10 loadout shines, its bafflingly fast TTK will have you feeling bad for your enemies. Unlike most of the best guns in Battlefield 6, the SCW-10 is locked behind an assignment, specifically, the Close Quarters 1 assignment. Most assignments are pretty horrible, but this one isn't too bad (just a bit of a grind), requiring you to get 300 close-quarter kills with SMGs and inflict 10,000 damage while aiming with SMGs. Best SCW-10 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) I recommend the following attachments for my SCW-10 build: Muzzle: Single-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Light 6.8\" Fluted (20) Magazine: 20 RND Magazine (20) Ammunition: Hollow Point (20) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) Accessory: 50MW Green (20) While it can stay oddly competitive at mid-range like most SMGs, the SCW-10 is undeniably a close-quarters weapon. With that in mind, there's little to be gained by improving recoil control or ADS accuracy. The main attachment…",

That's why we have crowned it the best luxury gaming desk right now. Going for $2,500 to $3,200 (depending on whether you want solid timber or plywood), it's a desk that sports a price tag bigger than a beefy RTX 5080 PC's, so you may be wondering why we like it so much. Well, let's start with the look. The Walnut model we got our fingers (and gaming PC) on is absolutely gorgeous. Our Jacob said they didn't just feel in awe when they first saw it, but got that feeling for months—it's just that nice. As well as this, the motor that swaps it from standing to seated is super smooth and can be fixed on the side in full view or under the drawer, tucked away. Oh yeah, did I mention the drawer? It smoothly slides out from the wooden frame and gets larger the further you get in, which means it feels almost hidden at the front of the desk.

For me, however, its the function combined with the form that makes them visually intriguing, so I'm not entirely sure Edifier's new desktop PC-like speaker design makes much sense. It's called the Huazai New Cyber , and it made me do a double take when I saw it in my newsfeed this morning (via TechSpot ). What looks to be a slim and sleek SFF chassis housing a CPU cooler, AIO radiator, and some unrecognisable graphics card is actually a desktop Bluetooth speaker. Because... well, I'm still not sure. Are we now living in an era where the gaming PC aesthetic is somehow aspirational? I suppose that might account for it. After all, a modern gaming desktop can be a very expensive thing, and a quick look at the Battlestations subreddit reveals a huge number of users anxious to show off their pricey, RGB-lit setups to the world. So, aspirational = luxury, luxury = home decor. It's also a good opportunity to do an Xzibit and put a gaming PC on your gamin…",

That's \"a global cosmetic mod to ensure the most comfortable Serious Sam 2 experience possible\", that does things like rework the interface to be closer to the Serious Sam Xbox version, tweak weapon visuals, and make \"enemies gib in a much more satisfying way\". Which, thank god. The new update has also split the game's controller and KBAM control menus out into their own separate fiefs, separating the bindings entirely.

And from what I've seen so far, Eyes Out's latest game, Sleep Awake, does exactly that. My hands-on preview for Sleep Awake saw me enter the ever-shifting world of The Crush about midway through. The protagonist—Katja—had to make her way to a location, bypassing hordes of violent cultists to find the one person she cares about in this deteriorating world. (Image credit: Blumhouse Games) This was a stealth mission: Katja is navigating through broken apartments via rickety impromptu bridges, holes in walls, and decrepit elevators, all while making pit stops at almost every source of cover there is—that may just be my way of playing. The cultists don't have a particularly harsh line-of-sight—perhaps that's thanks to their ill-fitting gas masks—so if you're careful, keeping to the shadows and making use of all the cover there is, you can weave your way through them without many issues.

Enter the Lofree Flow 2 , which follows up on the original Flow. The latter stands as one of my favorite low-profile mechanical keyboards, so it's a tough act to follow. The Lofree Flow 2, however, has proved lightning can strike twice. One of the surprising aspects of the original Lofree Flow—considering how little-known the brand was at the time—was its undeniably high-quality construction. The good news is that you still get that premium feel and attention to detail in the Lofree Flow 2. If anything, it's been stepped up a notch. First, though, you'll need to choose from three size options: 100 keys (96%), 84 keys (75%), or 68 keys (65%).

    "body": "With each iteration, Razer seems to take its Wolverine gaming controller to new heights. The V2 Pro was a step up over the original, while the V3 Pro repeated the trick, ending up as one of the best PC controllers money can buy. Now Razer has found a way to improve on near-perfection with the wordily named Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC . If you've got the cash for it as a PC gamer, it should be top of your list. Let's start with the build, which is sturdy and solid all over. The edge of each hand grip is coated in a dimpled, textured surface that helps it stay firmly lodged in the palm of even the sweatiest neckbeard. The durable construction should last you years of gaming, but Razer has included a robust carrying case in the box, just in case. To top it off, the controller's weight has been significantly reduced compared to the previous Wolverine V3 Pro, and it now sits at 220g, down from 304g—a 28% reduction. If you enjoy your fair share of marathon gaming sessions, you're not going to feel weighed down here. Almost every element of the Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC is decked out in a matte black finish, with a few gloss highlights thrown in for good measure. It feels classy in an understate…",

They were all very barebones and functional, though, and it wasn't until 2010 that it specifically targeted the gaming sector, with a collaboration with esports player Fatal1ty. Fast forward to 2019, and ASRock broadened its gaming appeal with the first of its Phantom Gaming series of motherboards. These were designed \"closely with partners to fine-tune the products, and to ensure every product can deliver outstanding gaming experience.\" Well, I can say now that one of its most recent Phantom Gaming offerings, the X870 Nova WiFi is neither fine-tuned nor delivers anything like an outstanding gaming experience. Don't get me wrong: it's not a bad motherboard. It's just that it's hampered by a number of compromises, middling performance, and a price tag that's a touch too high in today's competitive market.

For as much obvious Earthbound DNA there is in the massively popular Undertale, there's also a critical bit of Moon in there, too. After working on some RPGs at Squaresoft early in his career, Kimura satirized the genre by having you go around healing monsters with kindness instead of killing them. Fox's love for Moon helped convince Kimura to get it translated and released on Steam and Switch after two decades. (Image credit: tobyfox) Their friendship, I realized within a few minutes of talking with Kimura in Tokyo last month, also makes him careful to avoid piggybacking off of Undertale's popularity even if he'd have a good case for doing so. \"The most important thing for me when talking about Toby Fox in public is that I really like him, and because I really like him and respect him. I don't want anyone to get the impression I'm trying to use his name,\" Kimura told me. \"Undertale itself is a great game—playing it really moved me. It hit me in the soul, rather than the feels.

That number comes from SteamDB , which shows Battlefield 6 jockeying with Dota 2 for second most-played game on Steam right now behind the platform's perennial #1, Counter-Strike 2. The number has been left to simmer for a bit as I write this on a Sunday morning, but sits proudly at around 600,000 active players regardless. With a bit more oomph as the game builds up steam, it might just overtake Baldur's Gate 3's historical peak of 875,000 simultaneous players, which would put it very close to the all-time top ten . Still, it's overtaken the likes of Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and notably, any Call of Duty game on the platform, so even if it plateaus from here it is a seismic release.

At the end of this month developer Northplay is running a closed alpha playtest, and you can sign up to test its tyrannosaurs right now. In a Steam post , Northplay explained the closed alpha will comprise a \"small slice\" of Dinolords, though to my eye it looks like a sizeable slab of stegosaur steak. The closed alpha will let players get hands-on with a three-part tutorial, after which they'll be able to explore four distinct maps, two different game modes, and a \"'campaign' setup with cross-level progression.\" That's enough to give Fred Flintstone indigestion.

The good news is, there are indeed plans for a new ToeJam and Earl game. The bad news is, at this stage, they're little more than that. The update comes direct from ToeJam and Earl co-creator Greg Johnson, who took to Reddit recently for an AMA . The subject of a new game was eventually broached by user Arkeband, who asked whether there was anything Johnson could share about previous \"whispers\" of another entry. Johnson's response was brief, but candid. \"I can say that a new game is in the planning stage. We intend to make it happen,\" he replied. Unlike 2019's Back in the Groove, this game won't be developed by Johnson's company HumaNature Studios, though some contributors to that project will be involved. \"It's going to be developed by a third party, [with] design led by the infamous and talented producer of BitG, Nap,\" Johnson elaborated.

Salvatore dished on some of the unique challenges of writing stories that have to stay consistent with an ever evolving tabletop ruleset and world state. Salvatore has notably contributed to the Star Wars Expanded Universe (RIP), but is most famous for his novels set in the Forgotten Realms, a world shared with classic PC games including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and most of the Gold Box RPGs. Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D.

No enemy is safe from the barrage of projectiles that cover the entire screen and hit for billions of damage. Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters.

Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is one of the most infamous misfires of gaming history, a disaster of a scale that's relatively rare in the upper echelons of game development. Virtually everyone who played it at the time acknowledged that it was a buggy, broken, unfinished mess, and there were rumblings that Gearbox outsourced large portions of the game's development while it focused on building Borderlands 2. There's been little inclination to reappraise Colonial Marines since, and I'm not really interested in this either.

Vietnam, in case you're not already aware from going there, geography lessons, or ambient exposure to dozens of war movies, is almost half covered by jungle, and was more than half-covered by jungle prior to the Vietnam War. And the thing about jungle is the density of foliage makes it hard to see much else, like the sky, or passing animals, or someone with a rifle trying to murder you.
