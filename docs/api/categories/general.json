The first half of the game crescendos with a pair of classic Obsidian conversation boss fights, and I had a big, dumb smile on my face as I contemplated long, scrolling lists of dialogue options⁠—some available to me, some greyed-out—gated by different skills, background traits, quest choices, and even an out-of-the-way optional conversation I'd had over 10 hours previously. Since I had a ton of points in speech and had gone for nonviolent resolutions whenever possible, I was able to pull off a satisfying \" everybody lives! \" conclusion to this midgame climax.

On paper, Voyager and the survival management genre is a perfect marriage. One of those couples who go all the way, right into the coffin. A crew lost on the other side of the galaxy, pursued by threats that include the Borg Collective, unable to get any assistance from daddy Starfleet. It's a good fit. (Image credit: Daedalic) But while Across the Unknown's Steam demo technically has all the elements of a solid survival game and a good Voyager adaptation—scrabbling for resources, repairing and upgrading the ship, sending away teams into dangerous situations—it's largely devoid of any excitement or drama. Everything mostly plays out in text, accompanied by sparse art that's generally serviceable but sometimes rather poor, and basic, dead-eyed character models. While the dialogue broadly captures the vibe of each crew member, it feels more like I'm playing with an off-brand crew …",

Admittedly, I never played the original Screamer nor its sequel. In my defence I was approximately three entire weeks old when the first one came out. Not quite in keyboard-and-mouse territory with my tiny little fingers at that point in time. But if you were one of those OG Screamer (or Screamer 2) enjoyers, I'd recommend treating this new entry as something entirely different.

In a post on the game's Steam page , Fumi (the devs) and PlaySide (the publisher) announced that the game was slipping back from its originally planned 2025 release window all the way to 2026, which my brain refuses to let me acknowledge isn't 40 years away. Deus Ex: Human Revolution was set in 2027; we simply cannot almost be there in real life. Ahem. The good news is that that 'release window' is set to become a 'release date' imminently. Mouse's date is set to hit literally today, as part of the ongoing Galaxies Gaming Showcase. It'll just be a date in 2026 rather than 2025, now. If you've not been keeping track, Mouse is a good ol'-fashioned FPS in a good ol'-fashioned style. Literally. The game's done up like Steamboat Willy—a black-and-white, cartoon-ified world filled with '20s gangster-rodents for you to tommy-gun your way through. If someone doesn't say 'rattle 'em boys' at some point in this game, I don't know what we're even doing. It looks great, in that impressive, Cuphead sort of way.

One blocker to that might be hesitation over the new bespoke version of Windows running on the handheld. However, it turns out the handheld can run Bazzite—a Linux OS extremely similar to SteamOS—and doing so actually improves performance. That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Steam reviews are an endless source of both information and amusement. Where else can you read a review from someone who has played a survival game for 35,000 hours before giving it a thumbs-down ? Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again! In the quiz below, see if you can guess the game based on a short Steam review . And let us know how you scored in the comments: overwhelmingly positive, or mostly negative?",

But despite how Escape From Duckov presents itself, it actually doesn't waste much time on duck material. Yes, almost every NPC is some type of waterfowl, and yes, enemies quack when they notice you. But aside from an occasional duck egg consumable, there's not much duck humor going on at all. In fact, you don't even really have to play as one: The duck customization options give you all the tools to craft a different bird entirely. Or a sort of Fall Guys-esque bean man.

Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together.

Just to make sure I wasn't seeing things, I checked all 100 entries: Not a single one. No World of Warcrafts, no Final Fantasy 14s, no Guild Wars 2s, no Elder Scrolls: Onlines. Lots of RPGs, mind , just not massively multiplayer ones. What gives? Well, I've got a few theories, and I'd like to dig into them, but before I do: I think the MMO genre is actually in a pretty good place, right now. It's aging, certainly (we'll get into that later) but you certainly aren't spoiled for good offerings. World of Warcraft's got its juice back , and it's adding player housing soon. Final Fantasy 14 looks like it's on a course-correction . Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Online are great exploratory romps. Even those outside the big leagues are merrily trucking along. Hell, you can even play City of Heroes again! Arguably in its best-ever state! What, I say again, gives? Theory 1: Well, Harvey, none of us have any goddamn free time Here's the thing.

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up.

We can't predict all the lovely hidden gems that will pop up next year—we've tried, the crystal ball isn't playing, uh, ball—but what we can assure you of is that you'll see new trailers, reveal announcements, and even behind-the-scenes studio visits.

But this is the really exciting bit. Not only will this factory focus on OLED panels for monitors, laptops and tablets, at least at first, but it also uses a novel inkjet manufacturing process to reduce costs. Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones. Aside from the size of the substrate being produced, TCL's new factory is also interesting by virtue of using an inkjet process to \"print\" the panels . LG an…",
