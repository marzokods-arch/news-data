Each one has a fully customisable colour scheme. More than ever, this is a series about control .

The core loop is familiar to the point of, frankly, staleness—build enclosures, put dinosaurs in them, add and remove things until the dinosaurs are happy, plonk supporting buildings around them, repeat. Instead of shaking up the formula, what this sequel adds is more tools for refining, beautifying, and perfecting your park to your exact preferences. Buildings can be customised with a huge array of modular parts. The environment can be sculpted and shaped more elaborately than ever before. Almost everything can be recoloured, scaled, and rotated. \"…",

As always though, the first round of information includes some exciting additions the game can expect, but doesn't expose a lot of details like a release date. Luckily the official blog post about the drop, alongside the announcement at Minecraft Live 2025, has still given us plenty of information to dissect. As the title suggests, this update is all about adding new mounts to the game and a few items to improve the experience you currently have with mounts. As it stands, you're only able to ride horses, donkeys, mules, camels and pigs in Minecraft, so it'll be nice to shake things up and get new mounts to help you traverse open stretches of water as well as just land. Especially now you can craft a saddle. Here's everything we currently know about the Mounts of Mayhem update. When will the Mounts of Mayhem update be released in Minecraft? The Mounts of Mayhem update doesn't have a release date yet, and seeing as the Copper Age drop just launched, it will be a few months before we see the next update rolled out.

Especially if you have copper golems sorting out your base, or you've decorated floor to ceiling with various copper items. Luckily, it's not too challenging to gather as long as you've got the right tools and know where to look. A good way to start your hunt for honeycomb is by looking for bees, which spawn most frequently in meadow biomes. Venture to your nearest one, and you can start following them to their hive. But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead. Where to find honeycomb in Minecraft The key to gathering honeycombs is by locating a bee nest. But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured. When you've found one, walk up to it and use shears, and up to three honeycombs will drop. Shearing a nest or hive will anger the bees inside…",

Seasons are still how we experience multiplayer games at the moment, and Battlefield 6 is finally sharing its roadmap details as launch approaches. Battlefield 6 season 1 is coming October 28, just two weeks and change after its October 10 launch, and it's packing what you'd expect from an FPS challenging Call of Duty for the throne: two new maps, a handful of guns, a couple of modes, and an event. It's even got a CoD-like roadmap laying out the seasonal offerings in a grid so packed you'll have to pinch your phone screen to read the details. In a slight shakeup to CoD's playbook, Battlefield 6 will divide the content of its three-month seasons across three phases—the goal being a sizable update every single month. \"The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, new weapons and more,\" an EA-supplied press release reads. \"This is followed by the second phase called California Resistance on November 18, which includes a map located in SoCal called Eastwood and Sabotage mode designe…",

As I was writing this article, FOLON project lead Dean Carter posted a tantalising image to the game's Discord, showing a figure labelled \"soon\" being shot by a figure labelled \"today,\" which suggests to me that first DLC might be closer than ever. Like, today close. I think it might come out today, is what I'm saying. Called Rabbit and Pork, FOLON's first DLC will hit alongside its in-development 1.03 patch and is, sources say, quite large. But there is a touch of bad news: as spotted by RPS , the FOLON devs say the new content will require you to start up a completely new save. \"The DLC is DLC in name only really,\" wrote Carter, on the community Discord a few days ago. \"it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content.

What we got initially was a pretty generic survival crafting game where simply making a pair of trousers took almost as long as it would in real life. Since then, the team's introduced player-to-player trading, a magic system, an expanded PvP area and a variety of tweaks and changes—including the world itself being transformed, to better facilitate more players and building projects. And now it's gearing up to leave early access, with the 1.0 launch set for October 16 . Unfortunately, the players never really took to it, outside of the diehards. Active players quickly tapered off following the early access launch, with only small spikes thanks to notable updates. But even that seems to have stopped. This month, a big PvP update went live , and it didn't move the needle at all. Since early July, it's been stuck under 1,000 concurrents, and this month it's been averaging around 300.

The Arctis Nova Elite launches today, September 30, for $600/£600/€650. Okay, if you're still with me, let's talk specs. The headset looks a lot like the $325 Arctis Nova Pro —from the swooped back earcups and placement of the ANC and boom arms, to the desktop hub included with both sets. SteelSeries says it teamed up with a designer here, Jakob Wagner, but the external differences appear to be mostly material. Literally—the Elite has a little more metal, including the control wheel on the side, which might explain the added weight. The Elite weighs 380 grams. The Pro, 338 grams. But under the hood, there are some changes. The Elite's drivers are touted as carbon fibre. Rated to the same frequency response as the Pro's 40 mm drivers, 10 - 40,000 Hz, the carbon fibre cans are more sensitive with a dBSPL of 101 to the Pro's 98.

You could be exploring a vault or listening to a quest—like, perhaps, the Timekeeper invading your friends' brains and threatening you —and your shield will randomly pipe up to put you in your place.

This feeling has returned full-force after seeing a developer kindly explaining the difference between Skill Damage and Action Skill damage on the game's subreddit (thanks, TheGamer ), which probably isn't the place you should have to go for this sort of clarification.

All Skills are skills, but only some are Action Skills. Same as all Guns are Guns, but only some are Shotguns.\" Simple, then. Thurston then explains that Skill Damage impacts basically everything involving the word \"Skill\", including passive skills and traits and, you guessed it, Action Skills.
