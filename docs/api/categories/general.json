By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead.

It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears.

Only around 100 black units are expected to ship first, with wider shipments starting later in the week. The update follows the Pocket 6’s recent redesign, which reintroduced the handheld with two control layouts. It hasn’t been smooth sailing for Retroid over the last couple of months. After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced.

The retro gaming handheld space has grown exponentially over the past few years, but if there’s one newcomer to keep an eye on, it’s MANGMI. The company’s first handheld, the AIR X , was a fantastic budget device, and today it revealed the full spec sheet for its sophomore effort, the Pocket Max. Previous announcements have already revealed that the Pocket Max will feature a Snapdragon 865 SoC, paired with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage. That would have been a flagship gaming handheld back in 2023, but nowadays it places it firmly in the mid-range category.",

The chief highlight of the update is the improved version of Bixby, which we suspect is the Perplexity-powered version that has been rumored for several weeks now. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta has already undergone three iterations ahead of its speculated launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series next month. With just weeks left until the release, Samsung is hard at work to prepare the update for a stable release. In line with this, we’re now hearing information about the next One UI 8.5 beta. Tipster Tarun Vats has now shared the changelog for the fourth One UI 8 beta. Vats exclaims that the update hasn’t arrived yet, though it’s expected soon. Based on their previous suggestions, the update could arrive sometime this week, today through Friday, January 23.",

I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions.

The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool.

Subscribers on Verizon-owned Visible are being offered $5 credits. Verizon had a significant outage this week, with customers across the country losing service for much of Wednesday. After the disruption was resolved, Verizon offered account credits to affected users. MVNOs that rely on Verizon’s network also experienced disruptions, and now Verizon-owned-and-operated Visible is offering account credits, too — but they’re smaller than the ones affected Verizon customers were offered. As reported by 9to5Google , Visible has been sending texts to customers who temporarily lost service, apologizing for the outage and offering an account credit as “a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to” the MVNO. But while Verizon offered $20 account credits, Visible is only doling out a fraction of that, giving customers $5 toward their next bill.",

Leaks suggest that February 25 will likely be the day when Samsung launches the Galaxy S26 series. When that day comes, what devices will we see? In previous months, there was a lot of talk about a Galaxy S26 Edge replacing the usual Plus model. There were also leaks that suggested the base model could be rebranded as the Galaxy S26 Pro .

In January 2026, however, a ring of bright green and blue swirls in the ocean put a natural spotlight on the far-flung specks of land. A bloom of phytoplankton —tiny photosynthetic organisms that become visible to satellites when their numbers explode—encircled the Chatham Islands in austral summer.
