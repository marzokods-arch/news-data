At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has.

Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake.

From the 8BitDo Retro keyboard and the Pro 3 gamepad, to the R8 gaming mouse sat under my palm, they all have a distinguished and unique look, but they're so much more than a retro facade slapped on top of any old peripheral. Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons ‚Ä¶",

Of course, using the same gear as Faker isn't going to suddenly make you too a four-times League of Legends World Champion, but at the very least if you're matching the gaming setups that the professionals use you can't use that as an excuse. You're just going to have to use them to git gud. I've picked out three of the main categories of esports, FPS (Valorant, CS2, Fornite), MOBA (League of Legends, DOTA 2), and sports (Rocket League, FC25), and picked the most popular gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, and gaming headset from what the highest proportion of professional gamers use. It is worth noting that sponsorship and platform plays a big part of this, where Logitech sponsors a lot of the MOBA pros and the PS5 is the de facto platform for something like FC25, so the DualSense is the automatic choice for the pros.

Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about.

The recovery teams found a hardened underwater camera in the wreckage of the Titan submersible, and inside the casing was an undamaged SD card. pic.twitter.com/QCOtdcS7dU October 15, 2025 The submersible, operated by expeditions company OceanGate, imploded in the North Atlantic in June 2023 during a dive to the Titanic shipwreck, killing all five passengers on board and prompting investigations into the incident. The found camera, a SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic, was discovered with a shattered lens but an intact casing; while the memory card inside was also intact, the data appeared to be encrypted or otherwise inaccessible, as Manley explained in the above thread. Working with the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and camera manufacturer SubC, the investigators in the pictured report were able to recover nine videos and 12 images. However, as the US NTSB report notes, none of the images were from \"the accident dive.\" In fac‚Ä¶",
