While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so. The third option is GOG , but you might want to wait just to buy there: At the time of writing, GOG has just announced th…",

I was still at university finishing my Master's degree. I asked around the PC Gamer office (I sent a DM in Slack) and it turns out our staffers prefer to use GOG for retro games like Dino Crisis –which GOG recently brought back to life —and The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall .

This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation. It's now possible to set the actuation or reset point in increments of 0.01 mm, which is not somet…",

And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back.\" Why did Fulton Old-Yeller Old Yeller? He seems almost too irate at the social cost it's incurred to say: \"For development reasons, right? I don't need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.\" In response to IGN prodding him about maybe sticking a dog in the sequel, he concedes, \"I hear you on that. Hey, for those people that still bear a grudge, this is my penance.\" Which, you have to admit, is quite funny. Fulton is clearly catching no end of flak from his peers for taking the dog away, but I'm…",

So if you’ve ever wanted one of AMD’s thundering 16-core Zen 5 chips in your portable(ish) PC, this is your chance. It’s fast, though not 9950X3D fast. An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop. MSI positions it as “engineered for the demands of STEM professionals,” which probably doesn’t mean gardeners, and then takes a puff on some burning leaves to huskily exhale the phrase “it operates like a high-tech brain”. Yeah, man. The Vector A18 HX may well “deliver the performance and reliability engineers need to excel in every challenge,” but luckily for us it also delivers the kind of frame rates that make PC gamers very happy, and is so obviously a gaming laptop in an unconvincing disguise with its 240 Hz display, seven heat pipes, and two fans to keep it all cool.

You could immediately take part in almost any event and get a supercar in minutes in FH5. In fact, you could easily have a whole garage of supercars in no time—for free—thanks to the Wheelspin system. Not exactly what I'd call a career mode, and it quickly diminished any satisfaction from performing well to earn money and save up for your first fancy ride. This leads me to the one line from Xbox's recent Developer Direct , which finally opened the hood on Forza Horizon 6 , that instantly brought me on board: Torben Ellert, design director of FH6, said, \"You'll start out as just a tourist in Japan.\" Ellert explains that \"your first goal is to join the Horizon Festival by completing the Horizon qualifiers.

It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion I think is really clear these days.\" I would argue that the idea there's no objective evil in the world is maybe a bit much—there's plenty of ways we're all horrible to each other that aren't really up for interpretation.

I purchased the Peerless Assassin 120 SE V2, a version of the cooler with six heatpipes, for £26. It's currently $33 on Amazon US . Thermalright has around 40,000 variants of any one cooler, all with names using a combination of around ten words, and spanning nine pages on its website . I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging.

However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust.

In fact, as far as I know, you can only find it in the Originium Science Park area, and accessing this requires a fair bit of progress into the main story. Even when you arrive, you'll have to progress even more if you want to set up a power grid for mining drills and access the subsequent nodes deeper into the region. All that said, here's where to find Ferrium Ore in Arknights: Endfield, and what you'll need to do in order to mine it.

Nexus promised that it would look into supporting Linux for Vortex at some indeterminate point in the future, but I wasn't too optimistic.

It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right?

And it's setting the bar high. \"Although our game is a new beginning,\" said game director Ralph Fulton, \"I think what we're making is really faithful to the spirit of the classic Lionhead trilogy that we all love.\" The core of the new Fable is freedom, choices, and consequences: Setting off in the wake of disaster as Albion's first hero in a generation, you'll explore a seamless open world, visiting new and familiar locations alike including Bowerstone, \"a huge city full of contrasts: rich and poor, nobles and commoners, royalty and criminals.\" Your character will be fully customizable in both appearance and abilities, with access to melee and ranged combat options as well as powerful magic spells. There's also plenty of \"normal, everyday stuff\" to do in Albion: Jobs, romance, home ownership, becoming a landlord and making life miserable for your tenants, which of course will be reflected in their opinions…",

    "body": "At today's Xbox Developer Direct showcase, we got a new look at Beast of Reincarnation, a surreal action RPG in development at Game Freak, who are best known as the primary developer of Pokémon videogames. In addition to revealing more details about Beast of Reincarnation's story and gameplay, Game Freak put a date on the action RPG: it's out this summer. Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series. And let me be clear: Nier is beloved to me . The NieR connection isn't just visual: Beast of Reincarnation is similarly set thousands of years into Earth's future, where humanity is struggling against a plague of evil magical plants, as well as a distinctly Yoko Taro-flavored race of transhumanist robots gone wrong. \"The Golems are beings created when former humans transferred their souls into mechanical b…",

    "body": "Despite being left with an incurable spiritual absence after briefly enjoying the wonder of omnipresent access to 7/11 onigiri, I do my best to avoid perpetuating the Thing, Japan phenomenon —the tendency of Westerners to romanticize everyday life in Japan. Forza Horizon 6, however, seems intent on making that difficult. With a gameplay reveal during today's Xbox Developer Direct showcase , Playground Games says the next entry in its open world arcade racing series is its biggest, prettiest, and most customizable Horizon yet—and it's coming in May. Oh, there's a giant mecha in there, too. (Image credit: Xbox Game Studios) With the Horizon festival heading to Japan, Playground Games says it's deeply invested in capturing the sights, sounds, and essence of Japanese roadways—and presumably off-roadways. The studio says it's blending in-depth photogrammetry and field recordings captured from across Japan with new audiovisual tech like dynamic tire wear and improved environmental acoustics. It even says it's paid particular attention to modeling how cherry blossom petals react to passing cars. It's in Japan, see. Horizon 6 is, we're told, bigger—in a lot of ways. Japan is Horizon's lar…",
