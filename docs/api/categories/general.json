The display reportedly features a new metal plate design that reduces stress during folding, thereby removing the visible crease. This panel could show up in the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and may also be used in Apple’s first foldable iPhone. Foldable phones have come a long way, but there’s one design flaw that refuses to go away — the crease in the middle of the screen. At CES 2026 , Samsung Display may have finally cracked that problem. At its booth on the show floor of the tech show, Samsung Display is showcasing a brand-new foldable OLED panel that appears to have no visible crease at all. According to SamMobile , the difference is immediately noticeable when the new display is placed next to the one used on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 .",

In the time since 24K Magic , the pop icon has been selective with his output but impactful when he drops. In 2021, Mars and .Paak released An Evening With Silk Sonic , an homage to ’70s funk and soul that earned rave reviews and swept the Grammys. In 2024, he featured on the global No. 1 hit “APT.” with BLACKPINK’s Rosé.

This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

    "body": "Credit: LG TL;DR At CES 2026, LG brought back its Wallpaper TV in the form of the LG OLED evo W6. It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

Reading mode now lives permanently in the three-dot menu and keeps the address bar visible while reading. The update requires Chrome 143 and a manual flag toggle for now, suggesting a limited test rollout. Reading mode has been available in Chrome on Android for a while, but using it has never been particularly reliable. It only appeared on certain pages , relied on Chrome deciding whether an article qualified, and could vanish just as quickly as it showed up, which made it easy to forget the feature existed at all. That looks like it might be changing. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

We’ve seen flagship Android phones with 7,000mAh+ batteries in the last few months, while HONOR has just launched phones with 10,000mAh batteries as well. Now, a leaker has alleged that Samsung is testing a 20,000mAh silicon-carbon battery .

The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G and Galaxy Tab A11+ both arrive in early January. The previous Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone of Q3 2025. The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",
