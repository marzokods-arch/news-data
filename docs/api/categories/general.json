Parents will soon be able to disable Shorts on their teens’ YouTube app. A new onboarding workflow for kid accounts lets parents better control what their kids have access to. The YouTube app offers a handful of tools to help individual users impose limitations on their viewing, with options for periodic reminders to take breaks or go to bed . Parents whose children are using supervised YouTube accounts can control these features on their kids’ devices, and today, YouTube announced some new options to let parents further restrict their kids’ viewing. In a blog post, YouTube outlined new limits on Shorts videos for supervised teen accounts (the YouTube Kids app doesn’t have a Shorts tab). Parents are able to set a daily limit on time kids can watch shorts videos, with the option to set that limit to zero — disabling the Shorts feed altogether — coming “soon.”",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

Many of the changes and improvements that One UI 8.5 is slated to bring have been limited to visual aspects of the interface.

According to leaker Ice Universe, Samsung has also updated the kernel in the recent One UI 8.5 beta builds. With the specified “CZAA” build, which is likely leaked or unreleased, the Galaxy S25 Ultra jumps from Linux kernel version 6.6.77 to 6.6.98. According to the leaker, that’s a jump of more than 21 Linux kernel versions and could lead to a noticeable difference in the interface’s fluidity when the build is released broadly.",

Google first started moving Pixel phone production from China to Vietnam in 2019, and the company has continued to shift production from China to both Vietnam and India. Now, the company could actually do more than produce Pixel phones outside China. Nikkei Asia reports that Google plans to both develop and manufacture high-end Pixel phones in Vietnam in 2026.

The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

    "body": "Credit: Anker SOLIX TL;DR Anker SOLIX has revealed its latest hybrid home power backup solution, the E10. In addition to solar and battery-based backup, the SOLIX E10 also supports a fuel-based Smart Generator that can run on gasoline, natural gas, or propane. The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following up on its preview last week, the company is now disclosing details about the products. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",

It addresses shipping delays, poor customer service, quality control, and more. The company has also delayed the Pocket Play campaign while it works to implement the changes. AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott. After a poorly received initial response , AYANEO’s CEO stepped in to provide a full statement and “ Service Improvement Plan ” to turn things around in 2026.",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",
