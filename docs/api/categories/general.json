But in recent years, a Photoshop of the ad has taken on a second life as the perfect memey encapsulation of Romero's social media interactions with former id designer Sandy Petersen. For more than four years, Romero has been politely but pointedly correcting every inaccurate memory and anecdote Petersen's shared on Twitter (now X) from his time working at id Software. Nearly each tweet begins with some variation of \"Hi Sandy, hope you're doing well\" before nuking the original statement from orbit. Petersen joined id during the development of Doom in 1993, working on several of the game's levels and designing more for Doom 2. He also worked on Quake before leaving the studio in mid-1997, about a year after Romero's exit. That makes for a good bit of overlap, though of course Romero was with id from the beginning, having co-founded the studio in 1991. Romero, notably, has talked about having hyperthymesia , which he credits for giving him a vivid memory. I don't know if his recall is perfect , but each time Petersen trots out an id…",

That's largely kept me away from grand strategy and 4X games, which tend to offer the richest sandboxes to the most committed players, occasionally at the cost of accessibility to newcomers. The only series in the style that's truly won my heart is Age of Wonders, the fourth of which you can try for free this weekend until Monday, Nov. 17. If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops. In his review , online editor Fraser Brown said Age of Wonders 4 \"demands to be played over and over,\" and I concur.

Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results. No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling. (Image credit: Ubisoft) There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new \"creative house\" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that, though, was something of a low-key power struggle : Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft, but the founding Guillemot family …",

    "body": "\"Let's just get the bad out of the way: we have to postpone the launch of [Deep Rock Galactic:] Rogue Core to early Q2 2026,\" said Ghost Ship Games director Mikkel Martin Pedersen in a briefing earlier this week. It was a rip-the-band-aid-off opening for a presentation that quickly moved on to what Ghost Ship's doing in the meantime: launching a new season for Deep Rock Galactic, its first since 2024, while it continues work on the roguelite spin-off for next year. \"At Ghost Ship Games we've realized we can't have our cake and eat it at the same time, and do everything ourselves,\" Pedersen said. That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

Instead, however, it made a rather big mess of things : breaking existing mods, introducing new bugs, and causing crashes and performance issues. With Fallout fans decidedly unhappy about the whole thing, Bethesda now says it is \" actively investigating \" issues with the troublesome Fallout 4 update and Anniversary Edition, and that players \"should now see faster load times of the Creations menu, game menu, and redemption of Creation Club items.\" A hotfix is planned for early next week (so, not all that hot, really) that aims to address other issues, specifically: Fixing stability problems particularly on XB1/PS4.

The diner is a noticeable upgrade from Phasmophobia's early days where you scoured barren spaces for otherworldly clues amongst a room full of stock assets. I recognized very little outside of the intentional tie-in to other maps, but welcomed the unfamiliarity. It's just scarier when you don't recall the same few books or plates hurled at you by an angry spirit. There's little attention-to-detail items strewn about the restaurant too, like a leaflet reference to Maple Lodge Campsite, spooky arcade machines to interact with, a functional jukebox, and cans of sprayable cream ghosts seem to love. I should know, as just about every haunted tour I went on with the game's developers went straight for fiddling with the cream. You can even hear the haunted hiss over the Parabolic Mic.

What better time, then, for the big fella to finally get his own tabletop RPG? As revealed by our friends over at GamesRadar , IDW Games will be launching a Kickstarter for the game in March. One promising detail is the talent on the design side—it's being written by Gav Thorpe, Jervis Johnson, and Mark A Latham. Those are three legendary names in tabletop gaming, particularly on the wargaming side of things. They've all done serious time in senior positions at Games Workshop on Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer 40,000, and more. Thorpe also worked on videogames including For Honor and Space Hulk: Deathwing, and Latham designed Modiphius' Skyrim wargame and The Walking Dead: All Out War.

But apart from the over-abundance of still-somehow-funny 'GabeCube' comments, what I've seen perhaps the most is people questioning why the Steam Machine has just 8 GB of VRAM. It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though. Even when games don't seem to be trying to use more than 8 GB of VRAM, that might be because they're choosing not to stream as many or higher-re…",

Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD.

And this all makes me feel that, frankly, Meta is too comfortable. The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra . Even then, Pico's hardware isn't available in the US and mostly just apes Meta, with very similar specs. Even if the Pico 4 Ultra were to take off and steal back that oh-so coveted market share from Meta, Pico's parent company, Bytedance, is just as data hungry, making it perhaps not the competitor one would want.

Convincing co-workers, friends, and strangers wasn't too difficult until I'd mention the NG+ endings. Understandably, the idea of having to play through multiple iterations of a game to fully complete it was intimidating, and many people I talked to just didn't have the time for it. Aside from offering to play it through for them so they could just sit back and watch or promising that it didn't feel like a slog when you're actually embroiled in the story of Silent Hill f there wasn't a whole lot I could do to convince them, until now.

Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\". It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",
