This build, and a release build with debug features enabled as well as another drive with the DLC, were found on a pair of Xbox 360 dev kits in a second-hand store where they'd been sitting for a year. Some of the stuff that's been unearthed was already discovered in the PC version, but is present here in expanded form. For instance, it's long been known that Mr. House originally had a second securitron girlfriend named Marilyn—she's on one of the playing cards that came with the collector's edition, and there's a mod to restore her along with the single voice line left in the release version. But load up this build and you can have a whole conversation with Marilyn . There's also an early version of Mr. House, with a face that looks a lot more Steve Buscemi than the suave charac…",

And like any game as intensely moddable as the venerable voxel sandbox, each revisit is bound to become further divorced from the intended experience than the last. But here's something really different: as if to explore the frontier of unintended ways to play Minecraft, YouTuber smillgames has elected to play it on a printer . The sort used in restaurants. Eyup. Unlike the numerous attempts to play Doom on increasingly basic technology— a vape , or itself , for instance—this isn't about getting the game itself to run on the device. In smillgames' scenario, a different device is running Minecraft as normal. The receipt printer is merely used as a monitor of sorts, as he shared in a post on X . my next video might actually be the dumbest thing I've ever done pic.twitter.com/HFz6bAiCYH November 22, 2025 There is precedent for this; I think smill is getting the same sort of FPS I was getting on Oblivion back in the day.

A colorful videogame filled with cartoonish characters struck me as an odd thing to mash up with Tarantino's signature violence and profanity, but now we've got a brief teaser giving us a better idea of what's in store, and I have to be honest: I was absolutely correct. For those who haven't seen Kill Bill, or maybe just forgot, one of the film's secondary fights is a showdown between The Bride and Gogo Yubari , a teenage psycho killer in the employ of O-Ren Ishii, head of the yakuza in Tokyo. Gogo dies, rather badly (spoiler, sorry), and then, well, so does everyone else. The unfilmed scene in Fortnite will focus on Gogo's sister Yuki, whose existence (as far as I can remember, anyway) went entirely unmentioned in the film. Based on the teaser, Yuki is basically Gogo, except maybe a little psychotically peppier and with a fondness for guns rather than a meteor hammer. The first thing I noticed in the teaser is a change to the Pussy Wa…",

Although long gone, it's far from forgotten, as can be gathered from this Lego Ideas project . Made by lem.designs, the project is a faithful replica of the ZX Sinclair, all made out of Lego bricks. It won't play any of the classics, but it'll definitely fill you with nostalgia. The project comes with a total of 2,130 Lego pieces, and a big part of that will go towards the computer itself. The sleek PC looks almost just like the real thing, including a realistic keyboard with keys you can actually press. The keyboard alone accounts for 100 printed tiles, with stuff you're unlikely to find on keyboards of today, including \"GOTO,\" \"GOSUB,\" \"LOAD,\" and \"RUN.\" In the very corner of the ZX Spectrum, you'll find rainbow stripes, just like on the real thing. (Image credit: lem.designs/LEGO Ideas ) Of course, the ZX Spectrum wouldn't have happened without the man, the myth, the legend, the late Sir Clive Sinclair himself. Sinclair designed it alongside his team, and the Lego set acknowledges that by including a fitting tribute: a minifigure of Sir Clive Sin…",

The big news was announced in a very low-key fashion: \"We are pleased to announce that Steam Achievements are now available for Rainbow Six Siege!\" Ubisoft wrote on Steam . It also confirmed that, thankfully, the Steam cheevos will be granted retroactively, so you won't have to redo everything you've already done to earn them: Any previously unlocked Ubisoft Connect achievements will be automatically unlocked on Steam the next time you log into the game. (Image credit: Ubisoft (Steam)) Ubisoft didn't say exactly why a game that came out in 2015, and that transformed itself into the free-to-play Rainbow Six Siege X earlier this year, is suddenly now getting Steam achievements. But at this point I think we can safely say that it's kind of the Ubisoft way : After trying its luck with Epic Games Store exclusivity , Ubisoft came crawling back to Steam (just like everyone else ) in 2024, and it's been slowly but surely adding achievements to long-neglected games ever since.

Those of you hip to pattern recognition might note that those predecessor games seemed to get multiple expansions (Origins, likewise, got multiple), but it seems that won't be the case for Shadows. In a chat with JorRaptor (via IGN ), the game's associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois said that, \"at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned, currently.\" Which is a tad surprising, given Ubisoft's recent statement that the game is \" Overperforming \" against its expectations. I think the wording here is worth bearing in mind. Ubi's got no mondo-size expansions in the pipe, but Lemay-Comtois notes that \"We're still working on content for post-launch, and supporting it,\" so it's not quite as though the game is just being dropped.

You might think that's not such a big deal. After all, the Director's Cut will contain all the parts of the original game inside it like a beautiful criminal pupa, but the shift also entails a big change in the game's price.

Nvidia always supplied both the GPU and the VRAM to its add-in card (AIC) partners... well, potentially up until now. This made it easier for GPU manufacturers to stay on spec, but also removed the need for them to source DRAM directly from memory giants like Micron or Samsung. So, Nvidia took care of the VRAM and the GPU die, and the AIC did whatever they wanted with the rest of it, customizing the graphics card before selling it. If Nvidia has indeed decided to only ship the GPU going forward, its board partners will now need to secure VRAM all on their own.

Wands, for example, let you apply damage directly to an enemy, but need to be charged with books to gain damage. Mana stacks up until you have enough to cast a spell, at which point all mana faces become your equipped spell instead, freely cast until the end of the turn.
