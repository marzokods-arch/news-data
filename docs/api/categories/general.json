On Wednesday (Dec. 31) night, the 46-year-old pop star shared a selfie on social media showing herself in a hospital gown with a bandage on her neck while resting in a hospital bed. Despite the unexpected setting, the “Get the Party Started” singer appeared in good spirits, smiling brightly as she reflected emotionally on 2025 and explained the reason for her hospital stay. P!nk joked on Instagram that she wasn’t there for facial plastic surgery, but instead had received &#8220;two new shiny discs in my neck,&#8221; adding that &#8220;rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll is a contact sport.&#8221; She also noted that while she recovered alone in the hospital, her family was still able to enjoy the holiday by snowboarding. &#8220;This year was a doozy for all of us and it ran the spectrum from absolutely devastating to mildly annoying,&#8221; P!nk wrote in a lengthy caption. &#8220;In amongst all of that, there was so much beauty. And I got to wake up every day and get out of bed and go about my business.

While we&#8217;ve all got things to work and improve on for the year to come, we also have some wishes for things our marquee pop stars could commit to accomplishing in 2026, both for our sakes and for theirs. On this first 2026 episode of the&nbsp; Greatest Pop Stars podcast , host Andrew Unterberger is joined by&nbsp; Billboard &nbsp;charts senior analyst/writer (and regular Greatest Pop Stars guest) Eric Frankenberg to offer some New Year&#8217;s resolutions on behalf of said pop stars. We each choose five resolutions for specific pop stars to take on for 2026, and then we also offer one each on behalf of all pop stars collectively, and then one for us ourselves as pop fans. Among the most pressing questions addressed: Is it more important for Beyoncé to return in 2026 with visuals for her last two albums or with the last act in her LP trilogy? Would Dua Lipa be better served working with more dead-center pop collaborators on her next album? Are we overdue for an Adele legacy year? What…",

At 11pm local time, the official festivities were paused to observer a minute’s silence, as the Harbour Bridge was lit up with white light to symbolize peace, and a menorah was projected onto its pylons to show solidarity with the Jewish community. “Never Tear Us Apart” has a special place in the hearts of Australians. Released in 1988 as the fourth single from the album Kick , “Never Tear Us Apart” lent its name to a 2014 Australian biopic on the band, and the life and untimely passing of its singer Michael Hutchence. That two-part miniseries reignited interest in the new wave group, which is no longer active. Earlier in 2025, the song came in at No.1 on triple j’s inaugural Hottest 100 of Australian Songs poll.
