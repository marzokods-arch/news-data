The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

At time of writing, more than 500,000 people are playing Silksong on Steam, and the number's increasing every time I refresh the SteamDB chart . In its first 24 hours, Silksong's all-time peak player count is already the 18th highest in Steam history . And it'll likely rank higher before the day's out. As a point of comparison, the original Hollow Knight's Day 1 concurrent player count on Steam peaked at 812 players. In other words, there are roughly 615 times as many people playing Silksong in its first hours than there were playing Hollow Knight at launch. Call me crazy, but I think this one might be a big deal.

Through the power of cheesing the system, unfortunately. (Image credit: The Pokémon Company ) Yesterday, Phantasmal Flames products were loaded up onto the Pokémon Center, not for pre-orders, but just as a preparation for the launch. But in just under an hour, scalper groups somehow managed to trick the checkout system into selling them all the products they wanted. Leading to one group called Hidden Society purchasing around 42,000 Phantasmal Flames products. An admin for the Hidden Society Discord group sent a member-only message out yesterday (via pokebeach ) confirming that the scalpers managed to score \"over 42,000 items checked out (counting multi-count orders)\" \"If Pokémon Center wanted to pull stock earlier, they…",

It is worth mentioning, of course, that Hollow Knight: Silksong was never up for pre-order. Anyone who wanted day-one access to the game had to turn up at 15:00 GMT on the dot and buy the dang thing. Would allowing pre-orders, rather than forcing the game's incredibly thirsty fans and legions of curious onlookers to all show up at once, have ameliorated this situation? Probably a bit.

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds.

The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project.

This week I've been: planning builds for every single skill tree in Borderlands 4, hoping it would help me pick a character, but actually leaving me more conflicted. Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore.

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",

At the start of the video, Bond infiltrates a hotel in much the way Agent 47 from IO Interactive's Hitman games might, spying opportunities for non-violent distraction and deception everywhere he looks: negotiate with a guard, climb a wall, light a pile of leaves on fire, turn on a hose, jump into a flower bed (not the most Bond-like behavior, but it worked). Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Made yet another Baldur's Gate 3 character despite not having finished the game with any of the six characters he's already made. Once inside, Bond strolls around talking to himself and triggering little in-engine cutscenes, and you get the impression that there's only one way the mission can really go. When the video segues to a car chase, it makes this explicit with the text \"Inevitably…\" on the screen. In the chase, too, it seems clear that Bond is always going to be several car lengths behind his target, regardless of how many shortcuts he takes: He and the femme fatale must arrive at their ta…",

Plus, all these September city builders represent a nice mix of themes: there are a couple sci-fi builders, a couple more that take place in the past, and a few more set in fantasy realms. There's a cozy game, a couple puzzlers, and one with lots of combat, if that's what you're looking for. And if September doesn't have enough for you, I've tacked on a few more promising city builders planned for late 2025 and 2026. Since these city builders sprawl across multiple genres, I've got a code I'll use below to identify what categories each these builders fit into: Sim ⚙️, Strategy ♟️, Survival 🍖, Puzzle 🧩, Cozy 🧸, Old Timey 👑, and Futuristic 🚀.

With review embargoes lifting today, critics have been sharing their thoughts—and so far, our own Cronos review is among the more critical. While we eventually enjoyed the ideas explored in its time-twisting story, we found the amount of mandated zombie killing—sorry, \"orphan\" killing—slowed things to a slog.

Abyssus is a lithe shooter: you've got a dash and a double-jump right from the start, and enemies like divebombing exploding sharks encourage constant dancing around its battle arenas.

How you want to spend your time is up to you. I generally stick to shorter videos if I've already played the game and longer ones if I'm completely new. I've got a recommendation for both types of video and I'll leave it up to you which one you want to check out.
