I got to speak to design director Maria Hamilton recently, who said she's been wowed by the tools themselves: \"I think the first thing that I said on seeing where they were really early on was 'Oh my god, I want those tools', because they are vastly better than what many designers are using for building out areas.\" She clarifies that she means non-specialised designers, noting that \"If you're a worldbuilder, if that's your job, then you have really excellent mastery of very good complex tools. But the rest of us who are not artists are struggling the same way players would be.\" So intuitive, in fact, that she feels like they'd make good questing material: \"The tools that have been put together here are so intuitive and so easy to use, we really want to use them.

One thing that has bothered me, however, is the limit to two houses per account—one per faction. I'm a roleplayer, which means I have a lot of characters with different themes who might want different homes—and aside from building an apartment complex (which, hey, it's possible) I'm left without much in the way of abilities to do that.

Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015. Indeed, what little 8K TV sales there have been peaked in 2022. Consequently, the likes of LG and Sony are entirely exiting the 8K market . Meanwhile, the number of member companies of the 8K Association has fallen from 33 at the end of 2022 to 16 today . Only Samsung and Panasonic remain as TV manufacturers. In the co…",

That's why I was a little surprised to see competitive players as the target audience for Be Quiet!'s first foray into the gaming peripherals market. Unlike the Be Quiet! Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP. I can, however, say that the Dark Perk Ergo is clearly very well built. Despite holes in the bottom to cut down on weight, it's not flimsy. I can apply a lot of pressure on the side (be it for fun or because I've lost a round), and it doesn't move an inch. At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem.

During the TWT Finals over the weekend, we were treated to a trailer for Season 3 which seemed desperate to tell us one thing: Tekken 8 is going back to basics, promise. It literally says that in the trailer, too: Season 3 goes back to basics. Refined balance. More conventional. More focused. More deliberate. A fresh start. It's a lot more straightforward and communicative than Season 2, which is certainly a good place to start. It's also exactly the kind of stuff players have been wanting to hear for the best part of a year. Hell, maybe even two. But how that philosophy will manifest itself remains to be seen.

    "body": "Alone in the Dark was the first 3D survival horror game, beating Resident Evil to the punch by four years. Its polygonal character models in dingy pre-rendered interiors looked genuinely frightening in 1992 and, to be honest, still looks kinda creepy in 2026, albeit less for its realism and more for its antiquated art style. I'd highly recommend you play them, or at least, play a little bit of them: they're pretty hard going by modern standards. Now's a better time than ever to become acquainted with this slice of PC gaming history: GOG is giving away the original Alone in the Dark trilogy right now. It's actually more than the original trilogy too, because it includes Jack in the Dark, a weird spin-off released between Alone in the Dark and its sequel about a kid stuck in a creepy toy store. While Alone in the Dark has many of the hallmarks of early survival horror, including tank controls, fixed camera perspectives, and near-unmanagable combat, newcomers may be surprised how much it borrows from point 'n' click adventures. Puzzle-solving continues to be a fixture in survival horror, but Alone in the Dark adopts the age-old \"apply correct object to correct surface\" gameplay, albe…",

Since Fallout 5 could still be as much as a decade away, there's another possibility to keep Fallout fans busy with something new ish , at least: remasters of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. I imagine we'll probably get at least one of those remasters in the future: the same leak that was right about the Oblivion remaster also said a Fallout 3 remaster was in the works. So I guess the real question is: when? Naturally, fans are hoping it'll be sooner and not later—many even hope a remaster will be announced alongside the Fallout Season 2 finale this week—and Bethesda is doing its part to keep that hopium flowing. A new ad promoting Bethesda's Fallout games was posted today, and some fans claim it not-so-subtly suggests that a Fallout 3 remaster announcement is imminent. That's because the ad shows Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus on the Fallout TV series, inside Fallout 3. Hmm… In the ad, Moten is roommates with a giant Vault Boy mascot.

With another trackpad on the left-hand side in place of the d-pad, you're dual-wielding... and stuck with a high learning curve and a pretty ugly look. However, some have sworn it's the way to go, once you're used to it, and I've had what I can only describe as a morbid curiosity ever since. It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller.

Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ).

Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

    "body": "Guild Wars might look indistinct among the many MMOs that arrived in the wake of World of Warcraft's genre-defining heyday , but it has relatively little in common with WoW or even EverQuest, the Iron Age big dog in the massively multiplayer space. It's a unique blend of deckbuilding and ARPG-esque adventuring where you can team up with other players in town hubs across different campaigns—a setup so unique it's still drawing a crowd over two decades, a very different sequel , and a big modernization update later. It's not an easy game. But, the question always goes, how can I make this harder on myself? An update arrived Jan. 28 with the answer: Melandru's Accord. \"Inspired by the community-driven Ironman challenge,\" the new game mode will require that players earn all their skills and items without the relief of player trading or mercenaries (special NPC helpers that copy character builds and gear). The full list of restrictions can be perused in the patch notes, but suffice it to say it's similar to the self-found modes you can try in World of Warcraft: Classic Hardcore and Old School RuneScape. If you're the kind of stiff who likes to smugly muse about how RPGs used to be more…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I play far too many games with a competitive ranked mode. I'm not sure why I subject myself to the horrors that unfold in these games, but I do, so rather than question all of my life choices, I've decided to lean into it. So here I am, asking all of you whether you can decipher the game purely by its competitive ranked logos, while simultaneously creating an opportunity for all this information that takes up far too much of my brain to be put to good use. I knew it'd come in handy somehow. Many of the rank badges will look very similar—eerily similar, even—but I have thrown a couple of curveballs in there to spice things up and add a bit of much-needed variety to the long list of bronze/silver/gold emblems. I'm interested to see whether this is just common knowledge or an early warning sign, so let me know how you did in the comments!",

It's been a hot sec since I played BioShock Infinite now, but I'll never forget hearing the crooning of \"I may not always love you…\" drifting into my ears as barbershop quartet the Bee Sharps floated onto my screen, their a capella rendition of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows really selling the dreamy image of Columbia's city in the sky. Soundtrack Sunday Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday , where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering their thoughts or asking for yours! It's almost hypnotic in a way. Hell, maybe it was, because not once did I think to myself \"Hmm, isn't it weird that a game set in 1912 is using a song that didn't release until over 50 years later?\" I definitely should have thought that, because the way BioShock Infinite toys with real-world music is one of its coolest narrative devices. That is to say that also, the song is also just a straight-up banger. Not one that's being played…",

    "body": "Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. I've always deeply admired cosplayers. I'll never forget attending Final Fantasy 14's Fan Fest back in 2023 and being absolutely star struck by how people had so beautifully brought their Warriors of Light to life—towered over by bunny girls with carefully-constructed ears and replicated job gear, and wishing I was also representing my Viera in the real world. Unfortunately I suck at arts and crafts, don't have a lot of money to get someone else to do it, and I'm just… well, a bit shy. It can be a rather vulnerable thing, putting yourself out there in the hot-glued shoes of a fictional character. But it's also a way to display your love for a piece of media, your love for the craft, and for the characters we become so deeply attached to. I've only ever been brave enough to cosplay once in my life, at 17-years-old in a rather cheap-looking fit I'd scooped up from a UK-based ani…",
