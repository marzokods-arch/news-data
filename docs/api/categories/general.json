I personally think this mob boss is one of the coolest in the game, part-Deacons of the Deep from Dark Souls 3, part-Cleanrot Knights from Elden Ring. This group of glaive-wielding valkyries can gang up on you if you're not careful. After you defeat them all, they do an Abyss Watchers from Dark Souls 3, creating a super version of themselves with enhanced attacks. All the other Balancers will get back up, too, meaning you have to balance dealing with them and the main aggressive entity. It's a fun yet chaotic fight, so here's what they're weak to, as well as some additional tips to help you beat them if you're struggling.

This time we're opting for scales rather than feathers in the My Pet Dragons mod , which does exactly what it says on the tin—adds dragons to the game. Lots of them, too. While this mod might not be as popular among players, it certainly feels just as exciting. The My Pet Dragons mod adds over 500 variations of the little critters to your game, with some spawning in specific biomes and in the Nether. You'll be able to find everything from Ice and Fire dragons to Demon and Lucky Block species (whatever that means) and tame them before embarking on some pretty intense training. After all, you don't just want a cute pet, you probably want something that can take down at least some of Minecraft's many mobs. Yes, before you ask, you can use the dragons as mounts, too. So, similarly to the owls mod, you'll be able to craft a carriage for your dragons to carry you around on, ridding the need to trek to the End and get yourself an Elytra. Plus, there is just something inherently cool about being carted around by a little dragon. It's not all abou…",

My number one question for the cast: have they played any of the Fallout games the show is based on, either prior to filming Season 1 or following its huge critical success? \"No, I haven't sat down to play the games,\" said Walton Goggins, who plays pre-war movie star Cooper Howard and his post-war counterpart The Ghoul. \"And I won't. I won't. I won't play the games. I'm not interested.\" The reason is actually pretty simple: Goggins doesn't want to think of the world or the characters of Fallout as elements of a game. \"All of a sudden, I'm looking at this world from a very different perspective, and as something on a screen in which I am an avatar in. I don't believe that I'm an avatar. I believe The Ghoul exists in the world.

(And less successfully when he tried to take on The Ghoul.) But at the end of Season 1, Hank MacLean, played by Kyle MacLachlan of Twin Peaks fame, also got to climb into some power armor, and he used it to stomp a path all the way to the outskirts of New Vegas for Fallout Season 2. I recently got a chance to talk to both Kyle MacLachlan and Aaron Moten about the Fallout series, and I asked them about the show's T-60 power armor, how it works, and if it's a costume they can genuinely climb into and walk around in. \"I gotta tell you, it is such a thrill to have the power armor on,\" MacLachlan said. \"I got to wear it in Season 1, and now again, in Season 2.

    "body": "So you're wondering why you've suddenly been reduced to 50% HP while trying to explore The Great Hollow map? Elden Ring Nightreign 's new Shifting Earth event has a special (and somewhat annoying) mechanic called the ' crystal curse ', which inflicts a half-health reduction whenever you enter the castles or ruins in each corner of the map. This isn't ideal since those areas contain the best weapons and are the most lucrative when it comes to farming runes and gaining strength to face the new night bosses. Below, I'll explain what you need to do to complete the event and remove the curse so you can take on those areas at full HP. How to complete The Great Hollow in Elden Ring Nightreign You have to shatter four crystals around the map (Image credit: FromSoftware) Except for giving you an entirely different map, The Great Hollow event inflicts you with the crystal curse, a debuff that reduces your HP to 50% when you enter one of the region's big strongholds or castles. You can try to take these on at half health, but it's a challenge. Instead, to complete The Great Hollow and shatter the crystal curse, you have to find and break four crystals around the map .

It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

This nifty little creation has been put together by GitHub user sh4d0wm45K, and they've even put a handy .gif of the device in action on the project page . It works by detecting the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' Bluetooth address via some custom code running on an ESP32 devboard, which then lights up two lines of white LEDs on a custom PCB whenever the specs are within range.

Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE .

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

This is notable because Raspberry Pi SBCs (single-board computers) are normally very consistent in pricing. As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised.

However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness.
