Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025. What you can’t see are the two major upgrades under the surface, and in my opinion, even though they don’t justify upgrading from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to the 10 Pro Fold, they do mark a new era for foldable hardware.",

Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is expected to initiate One UI 8.5 beta next month. The Galaxy S25 series could be among the earliest devices to be eligible for the beta. The final update may arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 early next year. After a laggard rollout of One UI 7 earlier in the year, Samsung turned the narrative in its favor with the speedy release of its One UI 8 interface . But even with One UI 8 in its initial phases, Samsung is gearing up to dish out another major update with a horde of visual and operational changes. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to arrive early next year, in line with the company’s usual launch cycle for the new Galaxy S series. However, the beta will kick off much sooner, and SamMobile indicates it could be as soon as next month.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.
