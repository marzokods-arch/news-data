Fast forward to today, and it’s officially been over five months since T-Mobile and I parted ways. Now that the honeymoon phase with Visible is over and I’ve had time to really assess things, what’s my conclusion? Was the switch worth it?",

Everything reportedly works, including the new Camera app and its presets. There are a few issues, like the clock in the status bar not being correctly aligned. Although Android 16 has been available on Pixels for a while now, many other Android phones are just now starting to get a taste. For example, Nothing recently rolled out the Nothing OS 4.0 beta , which is based on Android 16. This beta is only available for the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Pro, Phone 3, and eventually the Phone 3a. However, it appears a developer may have found a way to get the OS running on a Phone 1.

Closer viewing shows One UI failed to keep pace largely due to user error. OnePlus’s latest OxygenOS 16 update is set to begin rolling out broadly next month . The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

Orders start October 19 at 8 PM PT, although full pricing and specs are not yet available. The Game Boy Advance SP was the original clamshell EDC, and countless gaming handhelds have been chasing that high ever since. Earlier this year, the Miyoo Flip tried and mostly failed due to a seriously compromised hinge design. Now the company is back with an even smaller version, and hopefully it’s learned from the previous release. The Miyoo Mini Flip has the same 2.8-inch screen as 2021’s Miyoo Mini, but apart from that, the company hasn’t announced specs or pricing. It’s almost certainly going to be a low-powered Linux device, most likely topping off at PS1 emulation.",

The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.
