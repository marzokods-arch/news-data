The developer, Techland, has stuck to using its internal C-Engine software package, though it's been \"heavily modified and upgraded\" since its implementation in DL2. With Techland posting some seriously heavy system requirements and Nvidia partnering once more for RTX and DLSS additions , I was concerned that Dying Light: The Beast would be joining a growing list of recent games that don't run very well on PC. Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs. What's very odd, though, is that at the time of writing, there are no ray tracing options whatsoever. There was in the first review version of the game I tested, but a subs…",

That's per one of the film's producers, Roy Lee, who told The Direct that \"Somewhere in-between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be.\" Which, great. Let me read that a few more times to see if I can figure out what it means. Nope, no luck. Okay, let me try to break it down for myself. I think we can take from this that The Sims movie will be something resembling a comedy, probably a family movie rather than a straightforward kids' film, and that its humour will be pretty universal but maybe dip into the more esoteric every now and then—you know, like the bit where Barbie chats about fascism.

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack. It's creative, it's charming, and it genuinely bridges the gap between two wildly different games.

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box .

They aren't strictly necessary (I'm not sure they all count towards 100% completion), but each one is a challenge you'll want to encounter if you're a completionist. These mementos aren't available until Act 3, mainly because the quests don't spawn, or you don't have the relevant movement abilities like Silk Soar. Below, I'll explain how to get every memento.

Looking at his skill trees, he's a bit…bland compared to the other characters , and after picking him as my main Vault Hunter, it's not far from the truth. He's generally quite clunky and just doesn't have as many broken perks as the other characters. Well, it turns out that Amon is secretly the most busted character of the bunch (and that's saying something), thanks to a potentially unintended interaction between the Berserk and There Is Only Death perks, and the Groundbreaker specialisation. The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick. So, every time you punch, you deal increased damage and infinitely stack even more bonus damage for the next punch. M…",

If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes. Spoilers follow, but this includes: Preventing the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields from getting stuck under lava, preventing Shrine Guardian Seth from exiting the battle arena mid-combat, and making sure Lugoli stops \"flying off screen and not returning during battle\". I like a tough metroidvania and wouldn't advocate for any difficulty tweaks, but I know there are plenty of players who are frustrated with Silksong's difficulty.

We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds. The bug even seems to extend to Patrol zones, although I was occasionally able to self-revive. Quite how long it will take to fix is anyone's guess, but as you can tell by the tone of Bungie's tweet, this is a four alarm fire.

Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters .

I'm baffled to say that Borderlands 4 finally changes this, tasking you with finding nine vault key fragments to open three unique vaults hidden across Kairos. While some are easy enough to track down, others are a right pain and will have you searching every nook and cranny—even once you've unlocked the hint by completing nearby silos. Below, I'll go over where to find each of the vault key fragments and their respective vaults. Since unlocking the silos isn't actually required to find the fragment they point towards, I'll cut to the chase for you (aside from the few cases where it's easier to reach the fragment using the silos' lift). Fadefields vault and fragment locations The Fadefield is the first area you'll have access to on Kairos, and it's a good idea to unlock its vault early on.

For a game that is so reliant on routine inventory management, Borderlands 4 has somehow managed to massively cock it up. To the point I'm confused how we're several games deep and yet this is easily Gearbox's worst attempt to date. This is coming from someone who isn't even massively fussy when it comes to clean inventory management. I just want two things: make it quick, and make it easy. Borderlands 4 does neither. Opening up the backpack greets me with a muddled array of items, which the game defaults to sorting by manufacturer. Naturally. Who doesn't want to organise their inventory by manufacturer?

The creator of this... thing is YouTuber Ancient , who's been iterating on a \"sphere o' mouths\" concept for robot lip-syncing (via Hackaday ). Essentially, it's a custom designed, 3D-printed ball of various mouth shapes, mounted inside a doll's head and spun in various configurations so only one mouth is visible through the gaping maw in the front at any one time.
