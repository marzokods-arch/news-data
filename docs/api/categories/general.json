Here at PC Gamer, we like to catch up on what games we all dug into over Christmas and New Years , before we fully accept the fresh grind of a new January. So here's what we all got up to—but we'd also love to hear from you guys. What games did you play at the tail end of 2025? Let us know in the comments! XCOM 2 (Image credit: 2K) Robin Valentine, Senior Editor: I always head into the holiday break with grand plans of catching up on all the games I missed that year… but instead I usually end up replaying something from 10 years ago. When the nights are long and the wind is cold, there's just something so rejuvenating about bedding in with an old favourite. So it was again in 2025, as I found myself on a whim starting up yet another new XCOM 2 Ironman campaign—with the War of the Chosen expansion and all the DLCs, naturally. It's not the sort of game you'd normally call 'cosy', but at this point all its bruta…",

It doesn't help that you're stuck on an alien planet, surrounded by weird, unappetising plants that you probably shouldn't consume without thorough research. But when the hunger kicks in, you'll need to scrounge up some food somehow. In StarRupture, you satiate your hunger by gaining calories. In other words, eating food. But each food item gives you varying amounts of calories, and some can even come with Toxicity. Below, I'll go over what you should look for to combat your hungry tummy. How to get food in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) The best way to get food and gain calories early on in StarRupture is to harvest and consume Polifruit, an orange shrub often found in plentiful patches on grassy plains , including around the pond near the starting lander, where they'll respawn regularly. So yes, it's your usual survival game routine of munching on berries for the first few hours. Once you've gathered a bunch of Polifruit, open your inventory and right-click the item, then select 'use' to eat them, gaining 11 calories. I recommend research…",

Those flickers of concern turned into a full-on conflagration following a recent report from Romanian outlet Need4Gamers , referencing stats from venture capital data platform thevc.kr which seem to show significant job reductions at the studio in mid-to-late 2025. In addition, Need4Gamers' reporter wrote that his own sources in and around the studio were decidedly negative about its outlook. I've reached out to Evr Studio to ask for a statement on its position and the future of Mudang: Two Hearts, and I'll update this piece if I hear back.

    "body": "Head-turning cases at CES are hardly unusual, yet this year has already seen a couple of belters . CyberPowerPC has helped kick off this year's show with a bang, flaunting a majestic mid-tower case that could fit into either an office space or a gamer den with ease. The case in question is the MA-01, which CyberPowerPC fairly calls \"elegant\". It's a clean fishtank-style case, with a tempered glass panel stretching from the side to the front. On top sits a woven steel mesh ventilation, and on the bottom sits a selection of ports, plus the case's standout features: knobs. These knobs control LEDs hidden in the interior of the case. The top knob adjusts colour, while the second adjusts brightness, and the third adjusts mode. Presumably, this means you could have colours pulse, alternate rhythmically, or become static. CyberPowerPC says these knobs work without any software and give you access to the \"full 16.7 million colour spectrum.\" Those knobs would mean little if the case didn't also look good, but luckily, it's sleek with plenty of personality, too, thanks to that dramatic lighting. It's the type of PC you'd want to pop on a desk, not only because it looks gorgeous, but also be…",

It's no surprise then that Asus' most recent collaboration with the creator looks pretty snazzy. Announced at CES 2026, Asus' collab with Kojima Productions includes custom colourways for the ROG Delta II gaming headset, Keris II gaming mouse, Scabbard II mouse mat, a custom carry case, and finally the ROG Flow Z13 . This collaboration is a very white and gold affair, with iconography largely left to Kojima Productions' iconic Ludens character. Designed by long-term Kojima collaborator and Kojima Productions lead artist Yoji Shinkawa, Ludens is somewhat of a high-tech knight figure and effectively the mascot for the company. Shinkawa says, \"I wanted to create a gadget that belongs to Ludens\", and he says the tech \"has its essence.\" The only real letdown for me here is the presence of the ROG Flow Z13.

Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun).

    "body": "As well as teasing a new ultraslim Alienware gaming laptop design Dell has also given us an early look at its new entry-level gaming laptops aimed at \"ensuring that really there is a product for everyone\" in its Alienware range. Dell's COO, Jeff Clarke, spoke at the start of our CES 2026 pre-briefing in December about the company wanting to get back to its roots and also broaden its horizons. \"It's a scale business, all 280 million units matter… You can't succeed if you're treating a portion of it like a distant relative... If I give you one thing to walk away with, it's the following: the consumer business is important to Dell.\" The whole briefing felt very much like a mea culpa from the massive PC box shifter, but it looks like the company is putting its product where its marketing mouth is, what with the return of the XPS brand, reining back its effusive AI marketing, and throwing cheaper Alienware notebooks out into the wild.

In the case of AMD, however, it's pretty much a case of 'more of the same, but just a little bit faster'. And when it comes to the newly launched Ryzen 7 9850X3D, that 'little' really isn't very big at all. The listed specifications for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are entirely unsurprising, not least because all the previous leaks and rumours on the new chip all tallied on the point of it just sporting a small increase to the boost clock. It's literally just a Ryzen 7 9800X3D , with a 7.7% overclock. (Image credit: AMD) It's not the first Zen 5 X3D processor that AMD has released that's faster than the 9800X3D, though. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has two core chiplets (CCDs), one with 3D V-cache, and one without. When it comes to boost clocks, the latter can hit 5.7 GHz, whereas the former topped out at 5.5 GHz in the tests I carried out in my review of the 9950X3D . This suggests that the CCDs rolling off TSMC's production lines are generally very high quality, resulting in a surfeit of CCDs that, when they've also gone through the V-cache packing routine, are more than capable …",

It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.\" Sarzynski also pointed out that while some players ended up losing Jackie very quickly, others (including, possibly, yours truly) \"manage to squeeze 20h out of Watson,\" Cyberpunk 2077's opening area, where players are confined before embarking on the big Arasaka heist.

That might not sound like strong praise for his own work, but Uematsu said listening to his own work as it plays in-game generally makes him miserable. \"I can listen to something that someone else has arranged for an orchestra, but when it comes to the music that plays in t…",

While the GPU options still range between the RTX 5070 Ti mobile and the top whack RTX 5090, the CPU choices are now either AMD's newly-announced Ryzen AI 400-series chips, or a \"next gen Intel processor\", according to the press release.

Maybe it's that January arrives to see us flush with holiday cash and looking to link up with friends instead of spending more time with relatives, but the first couple months of the year always seem to be dominated by surprisingly huge co-op hits. My incontrovertible evidence: 2025: REPO (February) : 271,571 concurrent players 2024: Palworld (January) : 2,101,867 concurrents 2023: Sons of the Forest (February) : 414,257 concurrents 2022: *crickets* 2021: Valheim (February) : 502,387 concurrents Admittedly I couldn't really find something that fits for 2022. (Lost Ark blew up huge in February 2022 to the tune of 1,325,305 concurrent players, but it's a free-to-play MMO so that feels like cheating.) Still, the trend is mostly true: early in the year there's almost always some big co-op hit that busts the doors off Steam. These games are usually pretty inexpensive, especially in comparison to the eye-watering $70 price tags of some games these days, and they're often early access, survival-ish, basebuilder-y games…",

Well, we are in Vegas , after all. For a start, there's an 8-inch display mounted to the card itself, which has eschewed a regular air cooler for an external 360 mm radiator with a three fan cooling arrangement. It's fed by a newly-designed pump that MSI says delivers 71% increased flow over previous GPU pump iterations, which is in turn attached to a full copper, full cover cold plate arrangement designed to keep things frosty. With a carbon fibre plate on the back, naturally. And frosty it'll need to be, as this beast is built to draw huge amounts of power.
