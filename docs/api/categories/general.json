That's my takeaway from a recent chat that Nightdive CEO (and System Shock Remake director) Stephen Kick had with FRVR . \"They don’t perform financially the same way that other genres do,\" said Kick. \"It’s a known fact, you make an imsim game you’re going to be appealing to a very small, niche group of fans that are going to love it, they’re going to be very vocal about it, and they’re going to try to convince their friends to play it, and they may or not be successful.\" That small, niche group of people is me and, I'd hazard to guess, you. But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them? Well, it agrees with us: Kick says the team \"don’t generally take in financial performance as a metric for whether or not we work on something or not, but w…",

Instead, it's primarily been found in weird hybrid tablets , ridiculously expensive handhelds , and a select few similarly expensive workstation laptops . It looks like that might soon change, though. Lenovo has been cooking up some new gaming laptops, some of which it showed off for CES 2026 (including one with a rollable screen ), and it's just hinted that a Strix Halo laptop might be in the works. Specifically, a 'Lenovo Legion 7 15ASH11', which was for a while listed as a supported model for its Legion Space software (via VideoCardz ). This is the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 10, featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia RTX 5080 mobile. (Image credit: Future) Note the 'ASH' there, which presumably stands for 'AMD Strix Halo.'

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",

That's probably a solid enough testimony right there. My job, then, is to not only refine Mochi-O into a weapon of war with upgrades and powerups galore, but to care for it and establish a solid bond through feeding it seeds and giving it plenty of pre-battle scritches.

    "body": "I don't have children, but if I did, I'd probably love them less than I love Deadlock, Valve's work-in-progress MOBA shooter. It might be unfinished, but its anarchic invite-only test has served up better live service than most live service games with its constant reinvention—a habit Deadlock's carried into 2026 with the massive update released Thursday. That update brought a new mode which is almost my favorite way to play the game now... if it weren't for one critical aspect. A normal match of Deadlock is familiar MOBA fare and is therefore extremely stressful. Games usually last between 20 and 45 minutes, and there's very little downtime as teams vie for objectives and farm creeps. Furthermore, every match is ranked⁠—there's no casual queue. Even if you just want to try a new build and unwind, your lackadaisical performance might be mucking up a teammate's chance to get promoted. This environment is fundamentally hostile to the habitual chiller. Most MOBAs have a chiller-friendly mode based on an old custom game tradition: All Random, All Mid. Everyone's hero choice is decided at random, and both teams barrel down a single lane to kill each other and start smashing towers as qu…",

Between complicated mechanics, detailed unit stats, and lengthy missions, they can feel like a big investment of time and energy. Heading into new roguelike Blightstone , just launched this week in Steam early access, I was girding myself for another steep learning curve and hours lost to figuring out which exact weapon works best against which goblin. I couldn't have been more wrong. (Image credit: Unfinished Pixel) Blightstone is snappy . I'm thrown right into a battle between my three-man crew (well, technically three men and a dog) and a small group of villagers. Within just a few minutes I've not only gotten to grips with how combat works, I've finished the fight, and I'm onto the next challenge. My brawler, hunter, and arcanist each have two action points per turn to play with. Though they boast substantial hotbars of abilities, it's immediately clear what each one does—here a damaging arrow shot, there a dog attack that inflicts a bleed status effect, etc. It's straightforward but not simple. As in any great turn-based game, every turn comes with difficult choices. You…",

Before I played No Players Online, I knew nothing about it, except that it was a horror game set in a server for an abandoned multiplayer FPS. In some ways it is exactly that, but in others it is not really that at all. If that description seems confounding, then it is only accurate to my experience with this deeply strange game, which is at once a fairly derivative horror experience and one of the oddest puzzlers I've ever played. Even the history of No Players Online is confusing. I've been vaguely aware of the game for years, but it turns out that the No Players Online I was familiar with is not the No Players Online I just played.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

Instead, Geoff Keighley cued up a trailer for an unknown hero shooter called Highguard. It didn't go great. The social media reaction was instantly hostile. Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness. That cynicism-for-cynicism's-sake aside, it feels safe to say that general distrust of this kind of game is at an all-time high. In Highguard's case, you do get a whiff of hubris fro…",

The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is.
