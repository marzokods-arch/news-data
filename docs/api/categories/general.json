According to strings in version 3.41 of Google Home for Android (via 9to5Google ), this unannounced device may be called the “Google Home Speaker.” This is interesting as it signals a departure from the Nest branding and a homecoming to the Google Home naming scheme.

Users have recently noticed that this no longer holds true, and some devices set to auto-rotate will turn even in calls. We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left.

The redesigned Setup Wizard includes thicker buttons and a cleaner card-like UI on certain screens. Most users are likely to miss the changes as the Setup Wizard only appears on new or wiped devices, but a refresh was much needed to make a strong first impression. Google recently rolled out Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 for supported Pixel phones, packing in many key changes , such as icon shape customization, step tracking in Health Connect, protection from SMS OTP hijacking, and more. If you are installing the update on an existing device, you’d have likely missed that the Setup Wizard has also gotten a Material 3 Expressive upgrade with this Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 release.

I’ve always wanted a Pixel Stand but never made the plunge on the older models, thinking a better option would come. This new one, with its promised Qi2.2 25W compatibility with my Pixel 10 Pro XL , seemed perfect. So I took the plunge and bought it. This mistake cost me $70, so let my story be a cautionary tale for you: You shouldn’t buy this charger for your Pixel 10 Pro XL. It’s a basic wireless charger that, yes, can go up to 25W wirelessly, but does so at the expense of terrible heat dissipation. And it doesn’t offer anything special that other Qi2 25W chargers can’t do — as a matter of fact, it does less.",

The next-generation video codec is said to offer better compression, enhanced support for AR/VR applications, and will operate over a wider visual quality range. It’s expected that 88% of AOM members — which include brands like Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and Apple — will adopt AV2 within two years. The AV1 video codec is about to make a generational leap to AV2. While the launch of a new video codec isn’t usually all that important to most people, this upgrade may be one you’ll want to pay attention to. This update could be a big deal for streaming video on your favorite platforms and devices. The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) has announced that it expects to release AV2 before the end of the year. The organization promises big improvements compared to AV1. It also claims that 53% of AOMedia members plan to adopt the codec within 12 months, with 88% of members expecting to implement it within two years.

The “digital receptionist” screens calls to determine if the caller is human, how urgent the call is, and whether it meets your customized criteria before passing the call to you. If the caller won’t identify themselves, it’s a wrong number, or the call doesn’t meet your criteria, the receptionist will either disconnect or take a message. Are you tired of being bothered by annoying robocalls? AT&amp;T is testing out a new tool that could help shield you from this irritating spam. The company also appears to have plans to evolve this tool into something more than just a spam blocker. AT&amp;T has announced that it is currently experimenting with an agentic AI-powered tool to combat spam and fraud. The carrier refers to the tool as a “digital receptionist.” This digital receptionist — which will roll out to select customers (who opt in) throughout the rest of this year — will use voice-to-voice and agentic AI to screen calls for you.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is rolling out an updated Photo Picker with a much-needed search bar, making it easier to find specific photos and videos to share with apps. The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker. Fortunately, Google is now rolling out an update to the Photo Picker that introduces some much-needed quality-of-life improvements. Late last week, Google began pushing the August 2025 Google Play System Update . While the official changelo…",

    "summary": "Pixel phones are starting to get native call recording — with one big asterisk.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google appears to be backing down from its long-standing position against letting Pixel phones record voice calls. The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

DeX now supports home screen widgets, a dedicated full-screen button, pinning any app to the taskbar, and new keyboard settings. The update also adds Google Finance stock alerts to the Now Bar and new “next” and “previous” media controls to Now Brief. As the stable release of One UI 8 reaches more devices, Samsung DeX users are discovering major changes to the desktop experience. Samsung completely rebuilt DeX on top of Google’s Desktop Mode, and while this new version will be better in the long run, it’s currently a bit of a downgrade. Fortunately, Samsung is quickly addressing the most common complaints and is even adding features that weren’t available in the classic version of DeX. A software update that rolled out for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 in South Korea last week is now available in the U.S. The update brings new features to Now Bar and Samsung DeX, most notably Google Finance integration and home screen widget support, respectively.
