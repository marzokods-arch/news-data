Salvatore has notably contributed to the Star Wars Expanded Universe (RIP), but is most famous for his novels set in the Forgotten Realms, a world shared with classic PC games including Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and most of the Gold Box RPGs. Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D.

Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build‚Äîwhich was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili ‚Äîin a recent video.

Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters.

Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is one of the most infamous misfires of gaming history, a disaster of a scale that's relatively rare in the upper echelons of game development. Virtually everyone who played it at the time acknowledged that it was a buggy, broken, unfinished mess, and there were rumblings that Gearbox outsourced large portions of the game's development while it focused on building Borderlands 2. There's been little inclination to reappraise Colonial Marines since, and I'm not really interested in this either.

Vietnam, in case you're not already aware from going there, geography lessons, or ambient exposure to dozens of war movies, is almost half covered by jungle, and was more than half-covered by jungle prior to the Vietnam War. And the thing about jungle is the density of foliage makes it hard to see much else, like the sky, or passing animals, or someone with a rifle trying to murder you. Getting killed outta nowhere is kinda how war rolls, especially from the First World War onward, but it doesn't make for an especially fun or balanced play experience. It's a dilemma that Expression Games has wrestled with for a while, as technical director Kieran D'Archambaud explained in the latest issue of PC Gamer : \"Particularly if you're new to the game, it can be very hard to understand where you're dying from.\" Expression's solution is to ‚Ä¶",

EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks.

There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them.

A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing.

    "body": "So, you've decided to become a sniper in Battlefield 6 . It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way. All that said, here's my preferred setup for the starting sniper rifle in Battlefield 6.

    "summary": "It takes some work, but it's worth it.",
    "body": "Carbines are perhaps the single best weapon type in Battlefield 6 , with the M4A1 and M277 continuing their domination from the beta. With weak default attachments, the best M277 loadout does take a bit of work, but it's worth it in the end. By default, the M277 has some of the worst recoil deviation of any weapon. When combined with a frustratingly small 20-round magazine, it's hard to consistently score kills at range or multi-kills. The M277's stock attachments look very cool and tactical, but it's not all that optimal to have a suppressor and large optic on a weapon with so much kick and so few bullets. So, here's what you need to do. Best M277 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) Here's the build I recommend for the M277: Muzzle: Double-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Heavy Extended 16\" Custom (10) Underbarrel: Alloy Vertical (20) Magazine: 25RND Fast Magazine (25) Ammunition: Standard (5) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) or RO-M 1.75x (10) Accessory: 50MW Blue (20) The Double-Port Brake and the Alloy Vertical grip are the two most important attachments on the M277, so it's good that you unlock them relatively early.

    "body": "The L110 is the starter LMG (or light machine gun) in Battlefield 6 , and as you'd expect, it's capable of spitting out an absolute storm of bullets before having to reload. The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending. If you're using an LMG as Support (which you should be), you'll also get additional bonuses to ADS and sprint speed, helping to make things a tad more competitive.

It's a big improvement over the measly launch offerings of BF1, BF5, and BF2042, and it makes progression significantly more rewarding. With so many weapons to unlock, both through career ranks and assignments, it's a no-brainer to sort the wheat from the chaff to find out the best guns . So, I've put every weapon to the test, including playing around with attachments, to help you out in the field. Best Battlefield 6 guns The best guns I've used so far in BF6 are: M4A1 (rank 2, carbine) M87A1 (rank 0, shotgun) PW7A2 (rank 19, SMG) DRS-IAR (rank 9, LMG) M277 (rank 11, carbine) SG 553R (Danger Close assignment, carbine) M4A1 The M4A1 carbine, unlocked at just Rank 2, is one of the best weapons in the entire game. Thanks to its high fire rate and solid damage, the M4A1 is capable of dropping enemies blazingly fast. Now, you might think that these positives must mean the M4A1 is weak at range.
