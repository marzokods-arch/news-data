Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case.

That's the reason for a device such as this one from Ampinel, which keeps a graphics card's power demands in check across the compact 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 connectors. The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",

Well, maybe now I regret that, because Big Jeff Bezos is taking some time away from making the Washington Post worse to dole out some very good games this October via Prime Gaming . Who says the capitalist class never does anything for you? You can find the full list below, but the big-ticket items here as far as I'm concerned are Fallout: New Vegas (either the best or second-best Fallout game, depending on what day you catch me) and Fallout 3 (slightly worse than Fallout 4; come at me). The former will be available on October 16, the latter on October 23. I suspect the timing here might just be deliberate: the very good Fallout TV show, brought to you by Amazon, is set to hit on December 17 this year, and Lucy and the gang are set to head to New Vegas itself.

As games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said this week , no one really knows, but the speculation we're hearing from analysts and corporate finance experts is that EA's new owners aren't likely to shake things up in the immediate future, and will probably do what you'd expect: focus on its existing live service moneymakers as it pays off that $20 billion in debt. Philip Alberstat, managing director at DBD Investment Bank, doesn't foresee a Toys 'R' Us-style descent into bankruptcy as a result of the new debt on EA's balance sheet. \"EA generates approximately $7.5 billion annually from franchises like Apex Legends, Battlefield, and FIFA [now EA Sports FC],\" said Alberstat. \"That flow of cash gives EA a real capacity to service the $20 billion in debt.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. It sucks to acknowledge, but we're living in a new age of crappy PC ports. \"It sure seems like there's something wrong with practically every major big-budget release on PC these days,\" senior editor Wes Fenlon wrote over two years ago . Sadly, not much has changed: The plague of stutters, crashes, and poor framerates has spoiled the launches of some of the biggest games of 2025. There's no one culprit for this widespread problem, but the industry's obsession with graphics is looking guiltier every day. Devs are increasingly happy to sacrifice acceptable performance at the altar of Unreal Engine 5's bells and whistles, serving up games that look slightly better than a handful of years ago (if you squint, and provided you drop a grand on a new video card). The pinnacle of graphics has gotten so stagnant and futile that PC gamers are eager to celebrate games that put performance first. And of course, it's the multiplayer FPS leading by…",

Right? The Halo series began in March of 2022, with a second season following in February 2024 and a third season following never because it was canceled. The show didn't really do all that well critically, as far as I can recall: I don't remember anyone saying they liked it much, though I also didn't hear that it was absolutely terrible. Former Halo art director Marcos Lehto stated that he didn't hate the show, but said it was \" Not the Halo I made .\" The general consensus about the Halo show seemed to be just sort of… eh . But a show being eh is sometimes just the sort of thing I'm in the mood for, and since it's on Netflix, the one subscription I doggedly forget to cancel, it sounds like the perfect thing to stream on a rainy weekend while only half paying attention because I'm also playing Super Video Golf on my Steam Deck.

If you're wondering about that odd name, the Waaagh! is the name of the massive military campaigns the orks wage on the galaxy every now and then when they get feeling restless. It is, as the Fandom wiki describes it, \"war on an apocalyptic scale,\" in which \"whole civilisations are exterminated and defenders' armies laid to waste as the Orks plough ever onward in an unstoppable tide.\" The good news is that these things tend to burn themselves out: Once the Waaagh! (the exclamation point is mandatory) has killed literally everything else, the orks will start fighting amongst themselves, as one does. It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober!

You play as some kind of interdimensional killing machine, an (allegedly) unfeeling assassin in head-to-toe armor that's part Jin-Roh, part Trench Crusade. Their face is covered by a gas mask under a wide-brimmed helmet like a British WWI soldier, but the rest of the ensemble is all plate mail, and they carry an assortment of both medieval and modern weaponry.

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem.

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022.
