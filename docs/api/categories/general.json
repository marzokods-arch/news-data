Whether it&#8217;s about having it, wanting to have it or not having enough of it, music that touches on the topic &#8212; in varying degrees of detail &#8212; has proven to do quite well commercially.

Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but it’s not going to be cheap. One of the most noteworthy shifts in Android gaming handhelds this year has been AYANEO moving away from ultra-premium handhelds with more affordable options like the KONKR Pocket FIT and Pocket AIR Mini, but its latest handheld throws all that to the wind to double down on complete, unnecessary luxury. First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons. It also appears to have an all-glass front, as well as transluscent, unlabeled buttons.",

While the handheld gaming space has become crowded, the Steam Deck remains a community favorite, thanks in large part to Valve’s steady stream of thoughtful software updates. That momentum continues with a highly-requested new feature. Valve has rolled out a new update that brings the ability to keep downloading games even when the screen is turned off.

Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube introduced Roku’s first projector integration and delivered 1080p resolution, Dolby Audio, and auto-focus and auto-keystone correction at a price of $249.

The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap.

Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness .
