After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

As per a recent leak, One UI 8.5 may put apps with “excessive ad” spam into a state of “deep sleep.” It may also begin analyzing notifications on device to ensure they’re only blocked if they’re spam. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S26 series, is set to arrive early next year. While leakers appear split on the exact launch date and some specifications , we’re seeing a relentless stream of tidbits about the upcoming phones.

If true, this would be the first wireless charging speed upgrade for the lineup since the Galaxy S20 series. Samsung’s flagships have long been criticized for their slow charging speeds, but there’s a sliver of hope on the horizon with the Galaxy S26 series. We’ve spotted branding for Super Fast Charging 3.0 , which aligns well with rumors of 60W PPS charging destined for the Galaxy S26 Ultra . Samsung is also working on faster wireless charging, and we’ve now spotted more clues about it. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Amid bustling new networks of roads, residential neighborhoods, markets, and workshops, lie signs of a much earlier era, when the city was the seat of a powerful pre-colonial kingdom.

Rather than taking it as an invitation to unplug and unwind, Twitter users began freaking out, reading it as in support of YouTube pause-screen ads. YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

The feature, initially available to Samsung users via the Good Lock module Lockstar, became more widely available with One UI 8 and is set for another upgrade with One UI 8.5 . But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended.

These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock.
