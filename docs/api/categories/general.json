It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with.

NASA/JPL-Caltech Now in its 26th year, the event brings teams of middle and high school students to the lab to compete with home-built contraptions. Teenagers wielding power tools and plywood demonstrated their engineering prowess at the annual Invention Challenge at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Friday. Also in evidence: lots of small motors, 3D-printed gears, PVC pipe, and duct tape. First held at JPL in 1998, the event pits middle and high school teams against each other as they try to get handmade devices to accomplish a task that changes annually.

Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The December 2025 update for Pixels, which introduces Android 16 QPR2, has improved the responsiveness of the Quick Tap gesture. Users report consistent success triggering actions with double-back tap, as compared to the hit-and-miss before. You can enable the feature or change its function under Settings &gt; System &gt; Gestures &gt; Quick Tap to start actions. December 2025 has been an exciting month for Pixel fans. Google not only rolled out the much-loved Android 16 QPR2 release in the stable branch, but it also quashed a ton of bugs with the update. Beyond what Google announced, users also reported that the update quietly restored the screen-off fingerprint unlock feature. Google didn’t announce this either, but as it turns out, the company may have also improved the double-tap back panel gesture. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Netflix is attempting to acquire Warner Bros Discovery’s studios and streaming unit. The proposed acquisition could see Netflix and HBO Max bundled together. If the bid is successful, it would reportedly lower the combined cost for consumers. Update: December 5, 2025 (10:43 AM ET): Netflix has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Warner Bros Discovery to acquire WBD’s film and television studios, HBO Max, and HBO. This means that shows and movies, including the DC Universe, The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz, and more, will now be under the Netflix umbrella once the transaction is closed. In the announcement, Netflix states that it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” The company also says, “By adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.” Netflix did not share how this development will affect its streaming prices.",
