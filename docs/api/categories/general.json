    "body": "The first Sims 4 expansion of the year has been revealed and it's cause for celebration for two groups of players: the Romantasy fans who are going to start churning out 'enemies to lovers' warring dynasty storylines and everyone who's been asking to finally get an expansion with an African theme. The Sims 4 Royalty and Legacy is all about creating family dynasties, earning prestige, and responding to scandals—this one is definitely for the Live Mode players. Seriously, stop me if you've read this one. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) EA says it partnered with the same Pan African Gaming Group as it did for the West African update last year to work on the new Create-A-Sim and Build/Buy mode items for Royalty and Legacy. One of the three neighborhoods in the expansion's new world is also West African-inspired. Royalty and Legacy release date Sims 4 Royalty and Legacy launches on February 12 , 2026 for the usual $40 expansion pack price. Typically there's bonus content included for players who buy the expansion within its first couple months, which is happening again, but this time it's two full new kits.

DieDevDie cameo in Quarantine Zone (Image credit: Brigada Games) Turns out, this odd-looking guy is based on the avatar of a TikTok and YouTube creator called DieDevDie who also provides voice acting for the character. This is one of a number of content creator cameos in Quarantine Zone, a little easter egg for anyone who happens to be familiar with them. Other than the change in appearance and some new voice lines, investigating these cameo survivors works the exact same way as a standard investigation . For example, when I investigated the skeleton, I checked him for all of the usual symptoms and found that he had a crossed reflex, meaning he was infected.

Usually, carrying infected contraband would get a survivor sent straight to liquidation, but you can choose to spare him and see how his experiment turns out.

Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\". It's not quite 1:1—rather than an early single-celled organism swimming through the primordial goop, you're a microscopic parasite invading a human body. But it embraces the same idea of evolution and customisation, to so far pretty impressive results. (Image credit: Aberrant Labs) The action plays out like a twin-stick shooter, my parasite's undulating \"secretors\" functioning as guns and my host's aggressive antibodies serving as the enemies.

An all-out Sonic kart racer ready to rival the Italian plumber's own offering Release date: September 25, 2025 Expect to pay: $70/£65 Developer: Sonic Team Publisher: SEGA Reviewed on: Nvidia GeForce RTX3070, AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, 32GB RAM Steam Deck: Verified Link: Official site Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is so messy and frustrating that I sometimes question why I like it so much. Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband.

Beyblade was at the height of its popularity in my hometown, and I'd asked my parents for an imported Driger V2 from a website selling toys from overseas, because—as Pokémon cards had taught my generation—Japanese collectibles possess an inherently greater potency. It was a sinister implement: a two-tiered engine of plastic-bladed violence. In its first match against my older brother's Beyblade, it detonated his feeble bit of Toys \"R\" Us fodder on contact. Once the ensuing shrapnel settled, I knew I had gained command of a terrible power. I wielded a battle top that should not be. And thanks to From the Top , a recently-launched top-battling roguelike, it's a feeling I can once again relive.

Fallout Shelter may not be the most action-packed game in the series, but you can't have people running around with high-powered weaponry popping each other's skulls like giant mutated zits in the real world—not yet, anyway.

The Peter Molydeux account was launched on Twitter in 2009 by artist Adam Capone, poking gentle, even affectionate fun at Molyneux by posting short, bizarre ideas for game concepts: \"Imagine a game in which you can date and form a deep meaningful relationship with your weapons,\" for instance, or, \"Imagine a game where you can do anything but once you do it you can never do it again.\" It didn't take long before the account exploded in popularity, and if you have any doubt about that, be aware that there's an entire, impressively detailed Wikipedia page dedicated to it. Some of the ideas shared by Molydeux were very funny, but it didn't take long before something even funnier happened: People began to notice that some of them were actually kind of interesting, too.

You’re not getting quite the same level of GPU power or build quality either, but a cheaper laptop like the Acer Nitro V15 can still produce the goods. And the heat. And the noise. Acer has taken a trip back in time for the V15, with the model sent to PCG for review sporting a Core i7 13620H processor. That’s a Raptor Lake chip with ten cores split between four P-cores and six E-cores for 16 simultaneous software threads thanks to the 13th Gen coming before the death of P-core Hyper-Threading. It’s a chip from 2023, but its max turbo frequency of 4.9 GHz means it’s still competitive, even if it puts out a lot of heat and drives the Nitro’s cooling system crazy. The heat production, and the attendant spinning of the fans, is one of the drawbacks that the comparatively cool-running Core Ultra chips have partly solved.

One hardware channel, though, is claiming that it definitely will. That's according to Golden Pig Upgrade on Weibo, as reported by Videocardz , which says that the launch of the Core Ultra 200 Plus range (the rumoured name for the Arrow Lake refresh chips) will arrive in either March or April (via machine translation). Evidence for the refresh itself comes in the form of entries in the Geekbench database. For example, this Core Ultra 9 290K Plus was uploaded only a few days ago, though it's possible that it's not genuine (i.e. it's actually a Core Ultra 9 285K result with a rejigged name).

In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again.

In fact, PC Gamer hasn’t reviewed many laptops with an RTX 5050 GPU. Creeping through the dusty stacks, marvelling at the symmetrical book stacking (just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947) and trying not to attract the attention of the librarian, I could find only one other point of reference: the Medion Erazer Scout 15 E1 . It didn’t do particularly well when put through the testing regime, which might have something to do with the Core i5 13420H and low, low price, but if you’re looking for PC gaming on a budget, it’s worth a look.
