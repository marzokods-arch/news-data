    "body": "TL;DR The ANBERNIC RG DS is a new dual-screen handheld with a DS Lite form factor. A new video showcases not just Nintendo DS emulation, but also lightweight 3DS emulation. Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps.

A method involving plugging and unplugging USB peripherals has proved fruitful, but can be very slow to get results. Trying out beta software means accepting some level of risk, but how much do you really expect to break when running an Android beta? Maybe Google Wallet stops working? Fingerprint sensor shuts down? A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software. That may be true, but this week was apparently the exception that proves the rule, as Google was forced to pump the brakes on Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 following reports of some seriously phone-breaking glitches.

Last month, Google Sheets picked up additional Gemini functionality , gaining the ability call on Google’s AI to do things like explain how formulas work and automatically correct errors in formatting. Today, Google’s announced that Gemini can now do even more in Sheets, carrying out increasingly complex tasks on your behalf. In a blog post, Google has shared that new Gemini integration in Sheets can automate actions that involve multiple discrete steps. You can now make longer, more complicated Gemini requests in Sheets to, for example, add a new column that populates with a formula dealing with inputs you define, or to add, delete, or rearrange columns, rows, and cells however you see fit.",

T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of.

With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back.

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.
