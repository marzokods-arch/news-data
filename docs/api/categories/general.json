Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses.

The phones are (or at least one of them is) slated to arrive with a 9,000 mAh battery. OnePlus has also confirmed the 165Hz refresh rate display and Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The duo is set to launch in China on January 8 and may be exclusive to the market. However, they are rumored to launch globally under the Nord series. OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

A little later, leaks indicated that the a new OnePlus phone — potentially the first OnePlus Turbo — was being developed under the codename Volkswagen , and that it’ll come with an enormous 9,000 mAh battery. Now, courtesy of a new leak, we’ve seen what appear to be live images of the forthcoming OnePlus Turbo. Android Headlines has published live images of an unreleased OnePlus device that it says is the Turbo. It looks like a standard-issue midrange Android phone, with flat edges and a glossy back that appears to be made of plastic. The model Android Authority shows off is shown in a bluish green color.",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

Other incentives are also available, including a student discount and trade-in bonuses. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the company’s latest midrange tablet. We liked the $400 slate quite a bit; in our review, Ryan said that the Pad Go 2 “might be Android’s best answer to the entry-level iPad.” The tablet launched in many countries last week, but the US missed out. Now, OnePlus tells us, the Pad Go 2 is available to order stateside, and it even comes with some decent perks. Starting today, customers in the US can order the OnePlus Pad Go 2 from OnePlus’s web store for $399.99. Through the end of the year, purchase comes with your choice of either a free folio case or a free stylus.",

A handful of Reddit users have posted recently that pictures taken on their Pixel phones got “lost,” not appearing in local storage or backed up in Google Photos. A couple of months back, user Blazgamer posted on the r/GooglePixel subreddit that photos they’d taken on a trip failed to appear Pixel 9. Earlier today, user portmafia9719 described a similar experience on Pixel 10 Pro . It’s not clear what’s happening to these photos, but a common thread seems to be that the pictures turned up missing after a lingering notification that said photos were being processed in the background.",

Pricing is set to start at $419, with crowdfunding beginning “soon.” Anybody can make a tablet, but as we’ve learned in the years since this form factor really took off, not everybody wants just a giant phone. Some manufacturers have sought to differentiate their offerings with an emphasis on screen quality — instead of a blaringly bright, glossy, laptop-like display, something more eye-friendly and pleasing to the touch. That’s just what TCL has been pursuing with its NXTPAPER tech, and now the company is getting ready to introduce its latest tablet based on one of these panels.

As that hardware continues to come into focus, we’re at least finding reasons to get excited about Samsung’s latest software, especially as that introduces new changes specifically for Galaxy S26 phones.

The order prevents new drones and components from being authorized for sale in the US, though it does not affect already sold or certified models. The biggest loser in this appears to be DJI, the Chinese drone and action camera company that occupies the largest share of the US drone market. The long-anticipated ban on Chinese-made drones in the US has finally been enforced, with the US recently clearing the way to ensure that only drones assembled in the country “dominate” its airspace. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently issued a new order that places drones manufactured in countries outside the US on a “Covered list,” which comprises products that “pose an unacceptable risk to national security.” Besides drones, the order basically includes anything with wireless radios.",

Even with Samsung’s launches still a couple months away, some of us have already been souring on the idea of the Galaxy S26 lineup , worried that Samsung’s gotten too complacent, and isn’t doing enough to keep things feeling fresh. Those concerns extend to the phones’ cameras, but even if we don’t get a big upgrade to camera hardware, we’re still spotting a few improvements on the horizon for Samsung’s camera software.
