Between the fantastic camera zoom, variety of video capture options, and premium extras, there was a lot to like. The X200 Pro wasn’t perfect, though. A weird glare issue on the primary camera, along with plenty of bloat, a dearth of AI features, and a ho-hum update pledge sullied the otherwise great package. Now, vivo has launched the X300 Pro, its next flagship phone for global markets. So does the new phone pick up the baton and run even faster, or does it stumble and fall in a heap? I took it for a spin for a few weeks to find out.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Steam’s maker, Valve, has been playing a huge role in Windows emulation on Android. Valve has funded projects such as Pex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Pex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets. Sean Hollister of The Verge recently discussed Steam Hardware’s role in emulation on mobile devices, parti…",

Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung currently offers a real-time Interpreter mode on Galaxy Buds models for translating speech. Once started, users can pinch the stems on their Buds 3 to pause or resume translation. With the Buds 4, Samsung appears to be upgrading Interpreter to let you initiate a translation session through that same pinch gesture.

One of the first we’ll be looking forward to is Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series, but we’ve got more than just phones on our radar, as we’re also anticipating Samsung’s next generation of Galaxy Buds earbuds. We’ve already taken an early look at the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro design , as well as previewed some animations showing off new Buds 4 functionality .

I’ve never been very fussy about my streaming device’s interface, so long as it works, is responsive, and allows me to easily access the apps I use to watch movies and shows. But I was pleasantly surprised when the Google TV device prompted me to set specific albums from my Google Photos account for my screensaver — a feature that has quickly become one of my favorites.",

No word on pricing or availability yet, but it is expected to launch within the next few weeks. Another month, another ANBERNIC handheld. The company has been speedrunning its retro gaming handheld releases in the latter half of 2025, but today’s reveal might be something special for fans of retro gaming. The ANBERNIC RG 477V, which was thoroughly leaked last month , is a new vertical handheld that brings together the best components of the company’s 2025 releases in a new form factor. As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games. The video also shows exceptionally small bezels, which isn’t the case for other vertical handhelds like the Retroid Pocket Classic .",
