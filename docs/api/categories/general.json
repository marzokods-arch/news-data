In the US, there are only a few Android brands to choose from, and I’ve stuck with Samsung phones simply because I trust the brand to deliver a consistent, reliable experience. While my heart remains loyal to the Pixel in many ways, I’ve been burned too many times over the years by bootloop issues, reliability concerns, and even my own carelessness on one occasion.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro Max is rumored to feature a bigger battery than the current generation. The international variant of the iPhone 18 Pro could feature a battery capacity ranging between 5,100 and 5,200mAh. This will be higher than the battery capacity expected of the Galaxy S26 Ultra. With the launch of the iPhone 17 Pro last year, Apple flipped the narrative around minimal upgrades to its flagship phones. Even though the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were only slightly refashioned, the changes were enough to make it the highest-selling phone series of the past quarter. One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra. Famed leaker Digital Chat Station recently suggested that the next-generation top-tier iPhone could have its battery capacity bumped up over the current generation.

The upcoming redesign will also add the ability to reorder passes and sort them alphabetically or by recently opened. Last week, we showed off Google Wallet’s upcoming home screen redesign , which centers on starring passes. It appears to be a nice change that focuses on the passes you think you’ll need the most. There was also a “View more” button, which we presumed would house the rest of your passes. The button didn’t work then, but with the latest Google Wallet v26.5.862583415 release, we now have a better idea of what this “View more” button on the upcoming home screen redesign would do.

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components.

What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together.

That detail came in a video that features the 10a in a blue colorway — and now, we’ve seen renders of the phone’s other colors, too, purportedly sourced from Google’s official marketing assets. Android Headlines today published images it’s referring to as official renders of the Pixel 10a in four colorways: a subtly green-tinged light gray, dark gray, purplish blue, and a bright, reddish pink. Previous leaks point to these colors being branded as Fog, Obsidian, Lavender, and Berry, respectively, though those names haven’t been officially confirmed yet.",

Including just the right one brightens up a dull text, or even helps convey some emotional subtlety that might have otherwise gone missed. But in order to get the most out of emoji, we need to be able to clearly see them, and it looks like Google’s working on a change in Gboard that could soon help out with just that.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to. The image below shows how these two new plans compare to the standard ones.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26. The feature is likely to be called…",

Google could also move the “Share conversation” button to the top-right corner of the main conversation UI for easier access. In the latest Google app v17.4.66 release, we’ve spotted a bunch of new Gemini features under development. There are more clues about Gemini’s agentic abilities for Android phones , a new Map area button in the attachment sheet, and a new “Characters” feature . That’s not all, though, as we’ve also spotted code for a couple of UI tweaks, which we’ve managed to activate to give you an early look.
