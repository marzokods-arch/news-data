The image from Android Headlines reveals a triple-camera setup, an extra side button, and a grippy-looking back, but no view of the front display. Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70. The Motorola logo sits in the middle and seems to blend with each color, and the back texture looks more like something meant to add grip than decoration.",

Cyber Monday is usually a continuation of the sales at best, and you’d be right to think that some of the offers are coming to a close. However, if you know where to look, some devices are actually cheaper today than they were last week, and a few are actually on some of our favorite pieces of tech. Having scoured the current crop, here are five device deals we found that are actually cheaper than they were on Black Friday. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Gemini has been working on a new “projects” option, much like ChatGPT already offers. Projects will allow you to sort files and chats around particular topics. After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

The S26 Ultra could retain its 6.9-inch QHD screen and quad-camera setup, but may upgrade to a new M14 OLED panel for improved efficiency.

Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",
