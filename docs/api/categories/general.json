It features noticeable upgrades to the base iPhone 17, a new design for the iPhone 17 Pro, and an all-new iPhone Air that is a joy to hold . If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.

Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

The last release was the Pocket S2 , featuring the fancy new Snapdragon G3 Gen 3. However, starting at $439 with early bird deals ($499 retail), it’s a difficult device to recommend. The KONKR Pocket FIT flips that script on its head. The first device from AYANEO’s value-oriented sub-brand, KONKR, features the same G3 Gen 3 processor but comes in at roughly half the price, starting at $239.",

The update appears to have been rolled out quietly, as there’s no official announcement from Google. NotebookLM is one of the best and most practical applications of AI for average users like you and me . Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well.

Many tested games have very poor performance, although a few titles do seem to run at a playable frame rate. The good news is that an Xbox 360 emulator is in the works for Android. There’s no shortage of quality emulators on Android today, allowing you to run everything from NES and PlayStation 3 games to PC titles. But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",

The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

Although it’s technically the same Qi2 standard that is likely going to end up in every smartphone, it also took a page out of Apple’s playbook with MagSafe — finally, in my opinion — by branding its implementation of Qi2 magnets, dubbing it Pixelsnap. Unexpectedly, Google also released a new accessory specifically built for the Pixel 10 , called Pixelsnap Ring Stand (). This isn’t a revolutionary product by any stretch of the imagination, but I do feel like Google’s headed in the right direction with this one. You see, me and these type of back-of-the-phone accessories go way back. Years ago, I was living near Denver, Colorado, and I took a day trip up north to Boulder.

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority Chrome is a great browser, but it’s far from the best one out there. I tested more or less every major alternative to Google’s popular browser and found a better option for my personal wants and needs. Samsung Internet has more features, offers superior customizability, and comes with a few extra security options. Despite what many think, it can be downloaded to just about any Android phone , so it’s not exclusive to Samsung devices. Most people just default to Chrome, as it’s the most well-known and readily available browser on all smartphones. But I urge everyone to at least try out Samsung Internet to see that Chrome has fierce competition.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority Samsung was initially tipped to replace the Galaxy S26 Plus with the Galaxy S26 Edge, but a recent report suggests that we could see both models . It’s believed that Samsung could therefore offer four Galaxy S26 series phones early next year. This got us wondering which model you prefer, if you had to choose. Are you looking forward to the S26 Plus or would you rather choose the S26 Edge? We posed this question on several platforms, and here’s what you told us.",
