    "body": "&#8220;Thank you for the best night of my life,&#8221; Zach Bryan told the crowd on Saturday night (Sept. 27) at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor &#8212; which is saying something for a guy who&#8217;s had a lot of those during the past seven years. The 27-song, nearly three-hour show, the 29-year-old country star&#8217;s last of 2025, made history on a couple of levels. It was the first-ever full-scale concert at the home of the Michigan Wolverines, known as the Big House, in its 98-year history. It&#8217;s also expected to be the largest ticketed concert ever in the U.S., breaking the mark of 110,905 set by country singer George Strait at Texas A&amp;M&#8217;s King Field in College Station in June 2024. An official attendance for Bryan&#8217;s show has not been announced, but concert organizers said it had sold more than 112,000 tickets after its Valentine&#8217;s Day on-sale sold out completely. Michigan Stadium has an official capacity of 107,601, but additional seating around the center-field stage — the same one Strait played on in Texas — made breaking the record seem entirely likely. The venue has also hosted up to 115,109 for a football game against Notre Dame during Septemb…",

Midway through 2023 single “Conceited,” Young paused to communicate with her keyboardist. The message did not appear to get across before she suddenly collapsed.

    "body": "A 10-foot statue of rock n’ roll queen Tina Turner was unveiled Saturday (Sept. 27) in the rural Tennessee community where she grew up — before becoming a Grammy-winning singer, an electrifying stage performer, and one the world’s most recognizable and popular entertainers. The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands. The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the “mane of a lion.” Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs “Nutbush City Limits,” “Proud Mary,” “Private Dancer,” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” from the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.”…",
