The publisher wants the ageing sequel to continue as the primary platform for virtual soap operas for the foreseeable future, rather than replace it and its many expansions with a full-on sequel. But the bugs piling higher than a locust swarm in a grain silo threatened to undermine the game's foundations. The first batch of bugfixes landed with immediate effect, addressing issues like deformed pets and vanishing ghost children. Slightly later than planned, the second QoL patch has now arrived, fixing more than 150 problems raised by the community on the EA forums and social media. As with any systems-heavy game, The Sims 4's complex web of interactions often produces patch notes that read more like a comedy script than an actual changelog, and this latest update includes some classics of the genre. For example, EA has tweaked \"relationship decay\" on couples who have a baby because it was \"too fast and destroying relationships\" (which frankly sounds realistic to me) while Sims have also been instructed to put items lik…",

You might be shocked as I was ( appalled as I was, mortified as I was) to discover that People Magazine, a publication for normal, well-adjusted readers, made no mention of the fact that Jonathan Bailey has voiced a catboy in a videogame since 2017. It mostly focuses on what he likes to do on a day off, what he'd tell his 15-year-old self, and how a perfect date night for the man would go. Where's my G'raha lore, People? For shame. Anyway—it's really nice to see Bailey continue to meet with success. He was getting work beforehand, mind, but his international stardom's grown exponentially since 2020. Which I have to admit is probably due to him starring in Bridgerton and not because he voiced my favourite scion. He also starred in 2024's Wicked movie, which is based on a musical you might've heard of. I'm confident his new appellation won't go to his head, though. One of the things I like about Bailey, aside from his performance, is that he doesn't regard his work as G'raha with any less importance than his sta…",

Well, today, he's a YouTuber and creator, and he's decided to fit his home with a whopping 200-pound 14-inch disc drive, which launched in Japan in 1982 and came to America in 1983. The forty-year-old tech may not store much, but it does have a loud sound. Wait, that's not a good thing? In a video titled \" SD Cards are LAME! \", Plummer shows off his DEC RA82 disc drive. \"You can feel it through the floor when it seeks hard\" is what Plummer tells the camera, in what I can only assume is a bit of glee. In order to even get the drive up into their home rack, Plummer ordered a hydraulic scissor lift. \"You don't so much install one of these as you do birth it like an ocean liner\". To get the drive operational with his choice of OS (Unix), Plummer did a low-level format to handle future data, partitioned the disk into different regions for storage, and then created file systems on those partitions. And what does all this weight, size, and effort get you? A whopping 622 MB of storage. That's …",

This meant that someone was able to archive the source code for the site's entire frontend and stick it on GitHub (via Ruri on X ). Now, I can't imagine it won't be long before this all disappears, but like AMD's accidental leak of the source code for FSR 4 , once it's out on the Internet, it'll be there for good.

Having spent enough time with the console to create an alarmingly accurate mould of the DualSense controller with nothing but my palm prints, I think I'm qualified in saying this: the PS5 is a bit chunky, innit? YouTube maker channel Not From Concentrate apparently shares this sentiment, having shrunk the standard, bulky console into a comparatively svelte 6-litre chassis (via Videocardz ). While the base version of the PlayStation 5 is a comparatively chunkier 10.4 litres, the slim—with the detachable disc drive that looks kinda like a zit to me—is only about 7 and a half litres. So, yes, you do lose those eye-catchingly swoopey white wings but you do gain back a whole lot of space around your TV. This isn't Not From Concentrate's first attempt at a tiny PS5 build , but this latest project features support for full size M.2 form factor SSDs, and enjoys a much bigger potential storage capacity for all of your games as a result.

Its developer, Adhoc Studio, just posted that it's sold over a million copies in 10 days , and it's not even done yet, with the final two episodes of its six-episode run due out on Wednesday at 9 am PST.

'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration.

While there are alternatives like GOG, the Epic Store, and *snigger* The Xbox PC Games store, Steam's enormous user-base, and, frankly, superior user experience make it the de facto marketplace where PC gamers make their purchases and developers jostle for their attention. But does Steam's dominance of the PC gaming market constitute a monopoly? Well, according to a new whitepaper, most game developers think so. Titled 'The State of PC Game Distribution' (via GamesIndustry ), the paper concludes that 72% of game developers believe the platform has a monopoly on the PC games market. The whitepaper was published by the digital distribution platform Rokky . If you're wondering \"who the heck is Rokky?\" then it's a new distribution platform that aims to connect publishers with various digital storefronts around the globe. The whitepaper was based on an independent study conducted by Atomik Research, which surveyed 306 executives in the UK and US between May 18 and May 22 this year. Of those surveyed, 77% were from companies with more than 50 employees, while three-quart…",

The giveaway went live, winners were picked, and all was good. And then the game got delayed to May 2019. And then again to 2020. And then again to 2021. In a sign of remarkable foresight, Level-5 then skipped a year to delay the game into 2023. And then, uh, it got delayed into 2024 before being delayed into 2025. It actually got pushed back again earlier this year—twice, in fact—shifting the release from June to August, and finally to next month. With the November release date here to stay, Level-5 hasn't forgotten about those who were bestowed a copy in its giveaway all those years ago.

Creative director Ed Beach provided an overview of update 1.3.0 in a developer video, starting with that civ-focussed balance pass. Exactly one dozen civilizations are getting a rework, namely Aksum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Songhai, Spain, and finally, Persia, which has been renamed slightly to differentiate it from a new DLC Civ. While the changes vary slightly between civs, the general thrust is the same. \"The majority of these adjustments are significant buffs aimed at strengthening these fan-favourite Civs,\" Beach explains. \"We're also introducing more specific bonuses to help each Civ lean into a unique playstyle.\" One example is that Egypt now receives \"tailored\" bonuses for building settlements and districts alongside river tiles.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library. The Internet Archive lost its appeal just a few months later , in September 2024. \"We survived… but it wiped out the library,\" Internet Archive founder Brewst…",

But maybe for all the wrong reasons. We'll have a full review in due course. However, the literal out-of-the-box experience with this Kickstarter-funded device is worth a few immediate impressions. This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches. But it comes with a centimetre-plus of bezel all round, plus a pair of huge clip-on controllers. The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words. It's so big I have serious reservations about how realistic it is as an actual handheld device. I'm not sure I'd want to game with this beast in my actual hands for very long. Moreover, the comparison between gaming handhelds and gaming laptops is often unflattering, in performance terms, for the former.

Beating them all for sheer out-of-this-world coolness, though, is Doom on a satellite, orbiting the Earth. Well, it was . The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet. Essentially, if your access was approved, you could upload code to the little satellite (just 10 x 10 x 30 cm in size) and have it do stuff for science. Of course, there's…",
