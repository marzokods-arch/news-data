Lainey texted us and I legitimately had to pull over to the side of the road and I was just sobbing. It was very special. It was bigger than I dreamed—and I got a deer that weekend, too, so it was pretty much the best weekend, ever.” Anderson has co-written nearly a dozen songs that have populated Lainey’s two CMA album of the year-winners Bell Bottom Country and Whirlwind , including the Country Airplay No. 1 “Somewhere Over Laredo” and top 5 hits “Heart Like a Truck,” and “Wildflowers and Wild Horses.” Cole Swindell, Gabby Barrett, Madeline Edwards and Nate Smith have also recorded her songs. Anderson highlights a wider scope of her songwriting range on her full-fledged songwriter project, Heart Like a Songwriter , out Friday (Jan. 16).

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

If you said yes to both, your 2026 is about to get better: Google has just released Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 for testing. Google began the QPR3 beta program in December with the release of QPR3 Beta 1, and with QPR3 Beta 2, Google has squashed a ton of bugs to make this next Android update more stable and usable.",

It’s the emulator’s biggest update yet, with many improvements across platforms. One of the most significant changes finally reduces input latency on Android devices. Nintendo 3DS emulation has seen a major resurgence in interest with dual-screen gaming handhelds like the AYN Thor and Pocket DS coming out, but its best emulator hasn’t seen a new stable release in five months. Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency. Previous versions had Vsync enabled by default as a way to reduce screen tearing in games. However, Android has its own frame pacing feature that performs a similar function. It has now been disabled by default, with the code around it cleaned up and consolidated.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is reportedly upgrading the kernel version on the Galaxy S25 with One UI 8.5 beta. When the said build reaches more users, they could experience a more responsive and fluid interface on their phones. The upgrade could also improve battery backup on existing phones. Many of the changes and improvements that One UI 8.5 is slated to bring have been limited to visual aspects of the interface. While Samsung is also expanding support for external hardware and giving you greater control over some crucial settings , it may also be working to improve the overall performance. According to leaker Ice Universe, Samsung has also updated the kernel in the recent One UI 8.5 beta builds. With the specified “CZAA” build, which is likely leaked or unreleased, the Galaxy S25 Ultra jumps from Linux kernel version 6.6.77 to 6.6.98. According to the leaker, that’s a jump of more than 21 Linux kernel versions and could lead to a noticeable difference in the interface’s fluidity when the build is released broadly.",

You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them.

We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",
