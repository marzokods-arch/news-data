But, as is usually the case with Terraria updates, what was originally meant to be a fairly straightforward Dead Cells crossover pack turned into something much bigger, requiring just over three years to develop. The resulting update has patch notes of near biblical proportions, but not everything included in Bigger and Boulder is listed: \"As always, we never share everything that is in each update,\" reads the update notes , \"not even in the 'full' changelog. Part of the fun is in the discovery!\" Very few aspects of Terraria are left untouched with 1.4.5, which is available right now. There's new items galore, and a hugely overhauled crafting system with which to make them. Inventory management has been overhauled, as has world seed functionality. On that note, a new \"skyblock\" world seed now exists which, as the name implies, resembles a floating island. According to ReLogic it \"introduces entirely new gameplay dynamics and ru…",

There's nothing wrong with Genshin Impact, but I only need so many open world action RPGs where you meet anime characters you can collect like Pokémon, and most of the copycats don't have anything else going on. Arknights: Endfield , however, does have something else going on: surprisingly robust factory building . I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.

The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend.

Eva Yan, Thomas's mother, told News12 in an interview that detectives believe the boy met someone while playing Roblox online, and subsequently planned to go and meet that person in the city. She added that such behaviour was completely out of character for Thomas. Yan says family and friends are organising search parties across Long Island and the wider city nearly every day. Police add that Thomas’s last known locations were near Cherry and Rutgers streets in Lower Manhattan and later near Sands and Jay Street in Brooklyn, and ask anyone with potential information to contact them (details below). A missing child is a situation with the potential for a tragic ending, and the case remains ongoing, which is why I was stunned to see the Roblox response. Roblox Corporation has now commented on the case via the official R…",

Chainalysis puts this down as a 51% increase year-on-year for North Korea, and if accurate that would mean North Korea accounted for just under 60% of all global cryptocurrency theft, estimated at $3.4 billion in 2025. A major factor here was the February 2025 attack on Bybit, which the FBI attributed to North Korea , saying it made off with roughly $1.5 billion worth of digital assets. \"This marks the most severe year on record for DPRK crypto theft in terms of value stolen, with DPRK attacks also accounting for a record 76 percent of all service compromises,\" says the Chainalysis report.

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch.

If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that . I can understand why people have been so quick to judge—Highguard is an awkward hodgepodge of genres that was poorly unveiled, and a sharp departure from the developer's penchant for movement shooters.

Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%.

Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK. This is generally the recommended option for programming for the Seed Studio XIAO nRF…",

For one, he wasn't actually meant to sit on the throne—until he orchestrated the death of his very large brothers. Also: he's an idiot, a coward, and his sole advisor (and friend) is a tiny floating robot full of milk whose sole purpose is to nurse babies. Her name is Milky. He's really the last person you want running the show when your home's being invaded by a bunch of weirdos from a very silly planet known as Earth. He's not the hero we need, but he's the only one we've got. The Ascendancy is screwed. (Image credit: Size Five Games) Developer Size Five Games has returned to its point-and-click roots after dabbling in football, stealth and platforming (though 2020's Lair of the Clockwork God was also half of an adventure game).

That's not just from the likes of publications such as yours truly, but also, it seems, from games, as the Arc B390 is now featured on the official Forza Horizon 6 system requirements . That's a game that's pencilled for a summertime launch (May 19), and as of now, there are only minimum requirements listed. On the GPU front, this means an Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380 or Arc B390. Minimum spec Operating System Windows 10 22H2 (19045) Processor Intel Core i5 8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Memory 16 GB RAM Graphics Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380, or Intel Arc B390 DirectX Version 12 Storage SSD required Note that the B390 is an integrated GPU. The other entries on that list are discrete graphics cards. In other words, if we needed even more confirmation that Panther Lake is capable of bringing the fight to the discrete market, here it is.

Hey, Highguard is out. I played around six hours between launch day and a preview event in Los Angeles last week. It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars.
