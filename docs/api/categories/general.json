Every level in Ultrakill begins with a diegetic shop terminal, sort of like the ones in Prey or the new (oh god, the newest one is 10 years old now) Deus Exes: You can walk up and seamlessly use your mouse to select loadouts without the game pausing, locking you in place, or hijacking the screen for a disconnected UI window. It's a neat effect I'm always happy to see, and now protagonist bot V1 can use it to get some frags in before it gets some frags in. Squaresweets built off the work of xabblll's DoomInUnityInspector and sinshu's managed-doom source port. Sinshu's source port was written in the Unity-compatible C# language, and xabblll's project got Doom running within the Unity editor. Squaresweets then brought it across the finish line to run in an actual Unity game. You'll need a .wad file of a version of Doom 1 to supply the art and assets for Squaresweets' ultradoom.wad⁠—at …",

Browsing CurseForge you'll see all the givens, like HUD tweaks and the gravity gun from Half-Life , as well as stuff that bridges the gaps left open by incomplete features—you can't tame a horse in vanilla Hytale yet, but mods like Traveling Mounts are a suitable band-aid. There's also all the people pushing the boundaries of what's possible, like the folks who got Hytale running in Hytale and invented Minecraft x Hytale crossplay . Then there's jaw-dropping projects like Runeteria, which dropped an \"MMO-style dungeon\" yesterday featuring unique legendary weapons and a custom boss fight. There appear to be piles of lethal goop that will hurt you, which I assume is what they mean by MMO-style.

It's not a side dish to be enjoyed alongside the main meal, but rather an integral ingredient without which the entire recipe would fall apart. Videogame music has long had a huge influence on me—I'm regularly bumping tracks from my favourite games in my day-to-day life, and the emotions they've stirred up over the years remain with me even when I'm listening away from the big in-game moment they were originally orchestrated for. (Image credit: Bethesda, Mick Gordon) One of the earliest memories I have of going \"holy shit, videogame music is really good\" (okay I probably didn't say exactly that considering I was like, four-years-old or something) was the all-out theme song for Killer Instinct Gold on the Nintendo 64.

It's gone down a storm with Terraria' community, but there is one aspect to the update that players will have to wait a little longer for—mod compatibility. This is because Terraria's mod support relies heavily on tModLoader , an open-source addon that facilitates both creating and playing mods. It's an enormously popular tool, with a user-base that rivals some of the biggest games.

It's become a bit of a running joke in the Final Fantasy 14 community that the MMO will never get Blitzball, with the game's director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) playfully scolding players during Dawntrail's pre-release when talking about Gold Saucer updates. Well, jokes on him, because Blitzball's actually alive and well in FF14. I have been to a match (big up the Buccaneers), cheered in a crowd, and even gotten myself a special novelty hat, all without a single lick of game code actually dedicated to it. The Etheirys Blitzball League (also known as the EBL) is a roleplay community that hosts and runs in-game tournaments of the fantasy sport. After attending a game, I simply had to see how it was done—and as it turns out, Blitzball has an entire rules document dedicated to it, one that's over 140 slides long.

But I'm not here to talk about Mario. I'm here to talk about Yoshi. Yoshi, Baby Mario's foster father and adult Mario's horse, is the headlining new character in the Super Mario Galaxy movie, which appears to be a neverending tapestry of references for theater-attending videogame players to point at and whisper, \"I remember that guy\" to their spouses and/or parents. The new teaser Illumination put out yesterday is packed with visuals and characters from Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart, Mario Sunshine, and the titular Galaxy. What's notable about this teaser is that Yoshi does that thing that he does. He gobbles up Kamek the Magikoopa in slow-motion with a flick of his tongue and then poops him out, his glasses comically intact over the fresh egg.

Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design. But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within.

The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist.

If it's not one thing, it's another: the anniversary of Half-Life 2, the latest mention of \"HLX\" (speculated to be an internal codename) in the Steam backend or, my personal favourite, a spike in pizza deliveries near Valve's offices. People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly. This is an over-simplification but games have so many moving parts that the final stages of development are where the whole project starts coming together. It's the most intense period of development and, yes, this is why th…",

The last ten years of Overwatch have certainly been a tumultuous ride, but I've stayed on nevertheless, because throughout it all, I always had confidence in Team 4 that they could learn from mistakes and put their best foot forward. And they have done, not only during the latest Overwatch spotlight , which blew everyone away, myself included, but multiple points over the last few years. The introduction of perks and Stadium last year, alongside map voting and hero bans , was massive for the game. Somehow Stadium manages to feel like an entirely different beast while also being approachable enough for Overwatch players to just pick up whenever, with even more changes coming soon to help its accessibility. Perks may have seemed like a small enough change, but they actually have a huge impact on how fights unfold in Overwatch. Perks give players the golden opportunity to change how they approach fights depending on how the game is going, wi…",

Getting stuck is a death sentence. Josee uses a massive katana that can cover most of the cramped boss arena in a single slash.

There are actually two types of yokai—Nurikabe and Mujina—that you can ward off using emotes. So here's what you need to do. How to emote in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) You can emote in Nioh 3 by pressing the right bumper and the start button on controller, or 'G' on keyboard. This will open the gesture window where you can pick from a bunch of different gestures (there are multiple pages, so no doubt an emote for every mood). Select your emote, and your character will bust a move. If you're wondering why the emotes are colour-coded, that'll come in handy for dealing with Nurikabe yokai.
