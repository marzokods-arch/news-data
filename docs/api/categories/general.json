The British rocker touched down in Sydney earlier this week and quickly drew massive fan attention after attending a pop-up photo gallery exhibition in Newtown, where crowds reportedly became so large that police were called to manage the situation. The event, titled Yungblud: IDOLS , featured photography by British photographer Tom Pallant and showcased images from previous legs of the singer’s ongoing tour. Yungblud — born Dominic Harrison — had encouraged fans to attend the gallery via social media, telling them he would be there in person. Hundreds reportedly queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the artist, with some lining up from early morning. Though no major incidents were reported, the turnout was large enough that authorities asked the event to wrap earlier than planned. “Yo guys, I love you so much, thank you for coming out,” Yungblud said in a voice memo shared to fans afterward. “That got a bit f—ing hectic, didn’t it? The cops said we had to move on because it was just getting mad.” The exhibition is scheduled to run through Jan. 11, with fans lining up as ea…",
