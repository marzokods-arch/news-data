    "body": "A tale of two laptops, this little article of mine is. Or perhaps I should say a tale of two GPUs instead. Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility.

The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit).

There's nothing quite like dropping into a Battlefield game on day one and enjoying the pure carnage and chaos of a good Conquest match. For those who played the beta, you'll know that Battlefield 6 is shaping up to be a solid instalment to the series, channelling its iconic large-scale warfare experience. Battlefield 6 is set to release on October 10, but this is different based on time zone, so when you can actually play will vary. There also isn't any early access to the game (no, not even with the deluxe edition), though pre-purchasing will get you the Tombstone Pack, which has an additional skin. For those who want to shell out even more, there's the Phantom Edition, which contains a whole heap of extra bits that are listed on the Steam page. All that said, here's the Battlefield 6 release time for each region so you know when you can start playing.

The complaint alleges that Roblox Corporation \"repeatedly assure[s] parents and the public that Roblox is safe for its user base of minors,\" but that it is in fact \"a hunting ground for child predators,\" who are able to operate with near impunity because of company's refusal to implement \"basic safety controls\" or even accurately inform users and parents of the dangers on the platform. \"These dangers are not trivial,\" the complaint states. \"They range from child predators acting along to international organizations—lined with terrorist groups—that are dedicated to child sexual exploitation and self-harm.\" \"Our children are not safe on Roblox,\" Coleman said in a press release . \"Predators and criminals aren't just lurking in the platform's shadows; they've been allowed to commit their crimes out in th…",

You’re a tiny weakling moving forward through a hostile world. Where are you going? You just don’t know. Why are you there? It's a dream. Why do all these trauma-inducing monstrosities want to kill you? Because you’re there. These games are not works of narrative genius and that’s entirely to their credit. They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever. In Little Nightmares 3 we can glean a lot about the sordid realities of the environments we move through, but we never learn with any certainty what that means to us, or how we fit into it.

PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them. So the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture.

Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it.

Key specs: RTX 5080 | Core Ultra 9 275 HX | 16-inch | 1600p | 240 Hz | 16 GB DDR5 | 1 TB SSD | View Deal Ah, the MSI Vector 16 HX AI . It's one of our favourite gaming laptops of this generation, mainly because of the sheer value proposition it provides. The RTX 5080-equipped version has been hovering between $2,100 to $2,400 since its release earlier this year, but now it's dropped to $2,000 at Newegg as part of the Prime Day sales, and that makes it even more of a bargain. Relatively speaking, of course. We're not expecting RTX 5080 laptops to drop much below this price for a while, but $2,000 is still …",

    "body": "It's almost hard to believe that a little over a year ago Diablo 4 looked like a completely different game. Blizzard pried it open and rearranged how loot works , giving the action RPG a solid foundation to build off of over the following seasons. The constantly evolving nature of live service games, however, means that enough stuff has been added over the last year that some of those older changes have grown a little stale in comparison. And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck. Let me tell you, spamming an upgrade button to see if you got the right result is not particularly fun, especially when you're doing it for every piece of gear you own. It's even worse when it's …",

By their nature, trains are long, cramped, and narrow, and the only material you're likely to come across is that one weird tissue that some former passenger has left wedged between the chair and the food tray that you will work miracles not to touch. I've been on multiple trains in the past year and I've only rarely had to open fire on anyone. So I was sceptical leading up to my hands-on time with Red Rover Interactive's Enginefall, which is in essence a Dune: Awakening-ish take on Snowpiercer . I might still be a little sceptical, but I see the vision now. Romping about the game's carriages with ad-hoc armaments, getting the drop on other players, and seeing the ruined world zip by out the window: it works better than it maybe should, and provides ample space for you and other players to gin up temporary, make-do alliances that you betray the nanosecond it becomes profitable. (Image credit: Red Rover) Good stuff, but there are caveats. First up, I was playing Enginefall under pretty much ideal conditions: alongside devs and media types…",

It's Tuesday morning on the west coast, and Steam is down. The website Steamstat.us is reporting multiple errors on the gaming storefront. The APIs for multiple Valve games, including Counter-Strike 2 and Deadlock, are also registering as offline. While Steamstat.us reports that many players are still connected to Steam's services, the store and community websites seem to be completely down. A sharp uptick in visits to the page is also telling: a whole lot of people are wondering if Steam is down right now, or if it's just them. It's not just you!

With an announcement trailer released this morning, Vampire Survivors developer Poncle began a weeks-long teaser rollout to preview the additions of the upcoming 1.14 update, starting with the long-awaited online co-op mode. The teaser begins with a mock Windows 95 desktop—presumably Poe Ratcho's, judging by the constantly rotating head of garlic displayed by an application called \"Garlic.exe.\" After a cursor selects a program that displays a large red button and the text \"Press here for online,\" we get a few glimpses of online Vampire Survivors co-op in action. As you might expect, four players can kill a lot of evil bats. \"Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended,\" Poncle said. \"Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665… More players doesn’t make it easier, or does it?\" We've known online co-op was on its way since it arrived on the Vampire Survivors beta branch back in August, but now we have a better idea of when.

    "body": "TCL has a new 27-inch 4K gaming panel out (via Notebookcheck ), the TCL 27R94 QD-MiniLED Monitor , and you might just need a pair of shades to game with it. That's a teensy exaggeration, of course, but with a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, this is certainly one of the very punchiest gaming panels we've yet seen. It's intriguing for one or two other reasons, too. But let's start with that eye-popping 1,600 brightness rating. This is a mini LED monitor, not an OLED panel and it comes with a VESA DisplayHDR 1400 rating. That means it must be capable of hitting 1,400 nits, full screen. By contrast, pun intended, the brightest OLED monitors are currently rated at 1,300 nits, like the LG Ultragear 45GX950A , but can only achieve that in tiny windows measuring a percentage or two of the whole screen. In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time. Either way, this is one very, very bright monitor. That said, it'…",
