We’ve known for a while now that Apple is working on an apparent iPhone Fold, which is set to take on the Galaxy Z Fold series. Now, a leaker has made a rather audacious claim about the Apple foldable’s battery capacity. Korean blogger Yeux1122 has claimed that Apple is testing a 5,400 to 5,800mAh battery in the iPhone Fold. The tipster claims that Apple might settle on the larger capacity at the expense of a thicker, heavier design.",

The alt-rock band will hit the region in May for a run of five arena shows. The tour kicks off with back-to-back nights at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena on May 2–3, then heads to Brisbane Entertainment Centre on May 6 and Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena on May 9–10, before wrapping at Auckland’s Spark Arena on May 13.

Interpol’s inclusion brings a stack of indie-rock staples — from 2000s breakthrough “Obstacle 1” and “Evil” to songs from more recent albums — while Ecca Vandal has earned a reputation at home for fusing punk, hip-hop and electronic influences into high-energy sets.

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

I have a small collection of old Game Boy, SNES, and N64 titles collecting dust in the attic, and I’ve turned to emulation to enjoy them while keeping the aging cartridges out of the reach of curious toddlers. Unfortunately, emulation and a shortage of time don’t really go hand in hand. I can never remember which device I played a game on last, meaning I might have one save on my phone and another on my laptop. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve not even had the correct ROM saved on my tablet. And then there are nights I’d prefer to play on the TV. It can be challenging to maintain enough consistency to really get into some of my old favorites.",

At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",

Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble. And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.

We have verified these claims, with intermittent charging, random stops, and extremely slow speeds. I also tested a bunch of 7.5W, 10W, 15W, and newer Qi and Qi2 chargers with the Pixel 9 and 10 series to find out which ones are the most problematic. With the Google Pixel 10 series , Google went all in on Qi2 wireless charging , embedding a MagSafe-like Pixelsnap magnetic connection. All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging. This upgrade sounds great on paper, but it has left users of older Qi chargers scratching their heads in confusion and frustration, and I’m one of them. As it turns out, Pixel 10 users have been complaining that their phones are not charging properly with chargers that aren’t Qi2 or Qi2 25W-certified. When used with a Pixel 10 series phone, existing Qi 1.x chargers appear to top out at 5W, often really pulling nothing more than 3W, which is significantly slower than those chargers’ advertised 10W…",

Samsung’s revised plan appears to retain the previous dimensions of the S26, with a smaller increase in battery capacity, while focusing on maintaining competitive pricing. Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup. A new report now sheds light on the reason behind some of these changes, and the answer is surprisingly simple: Apple. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Messages is rolling out @mentions in beta. These @mentions allow users in group chats to tag one another without directly replying to each other’s messages. The feature doesn’t seem to be universally available yet. Though it launched as a simple SMS client more than a decade ago, Google Messages has grown over the years, adopting contemporary features like RCS, read receipts, and message editing. Now, the beta version’s picked up a new feature inspired by other modern chat apps: @mentions in group chats. A post by user aniruddhdodiya on the Google Messages subreddit includes screenshots of the new @mention feature in action, apparently on a Pixel 10 running the latest beta version of Messages. We last saw evidence Google was working on this feature in September , but this is the first time we’ve seen it in the wild.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR ARMSX2, a new, modern PS2 emulator, is now available on the Play Store. The app launched a few weeks ago, but Play Store approval took a few extra weeks. It’s still early in development, and performance may be worse than AetherSX2/NetherSX2. PlayStation 2 emulation on Android has lagged behind its PC counterpart for years, but a new project is here to change that. Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

More importantly, it uses Gemini’s Nano Banana to help you create custom artworks. The frame is available in three sizes, ranging from 7.3 to 31.5 inches. AI has become the definitive buzzword for a wide range of technologies, gadgets, and software. But it may now be making way into our homes in an unusual way. SwitchBot, known for products that help you smart-ify various dumb aspects of your home — and also for quirky household robots disguised as stuffed toys — is now bringing AI to the humble photo frame . SwitchBot has launched a new digital photo frame, called AI Art Frame, which it previously showcased at the IFA 2025 trade show in Berlin. Unlike a regular photo frame, this one is far more than a mere screen on the wall. Instead, it features a colored E-Ink Spectra 6 display with a paper-like texture and vivid colors that make your photos look like actual posters.",

The gaming-oriented REDMAGIC 11 Pro excelled in our toughest benchmarking tests, largely due to its fan-assisted, liquid cooling setup. Meanwhile, the realme GT8 Pro runs extremely hot and has to throttle back its performance to make it through — but it manages to hang on. In the lab today, we have the OnePlus 15 — our first mainstream flagship to feature Qualcomm’s latest processor. Unfortunately, it’s the worst performer yet.",
