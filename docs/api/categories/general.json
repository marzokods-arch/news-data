Now it looks like Google could be getting ready to add music creation to the Gemini app. Music you make with Gemini would be stored with the rest of your content in My Stuff. Watching an epic action movie with the sound off just isn’t the same — the right music can really elevate an experience to the next level. Not all of us are musically inclined, though, which is why we were so excited when Google introduced a new feature for its Recorder app with the Pixel 10 that used AI to help us create music . Late last year, we saw access extend to Pixel 9 handsets , and now we’re checking out what could be an even bigger expansion for tools like this.

Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time.

Gemini is slowly but surely replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem. While we wait for a broader rollout, most Google Home users just want the basics to work again.

It’s launched one or two each of the last few years, sometimes under its own umbrella and sometimes licensed through CE Brands (now Vitalist Inc.). And yet, you might not have realized it’s done anything in the wearable space since it tried to reboot the Moto 360 several years ago. That’s how forgettable the Moto Watch experience has been. Somehow, though, I’ve always held out hope that something good was on its way. Until now. With yet another Motorola wearable on the horizon, I’ve decided it’s finally time to give up. I don’t think the Moto Watch will ever figure out its true identity, and I think it’s time we all moved on. Here’s why.",

The majority of the complaints come from Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 users. The reports come from different parts of the world and are not limited to a specific carrier or region. Google was already later than usual when it rolled out the January 2026 update for supported Pixel devices . Perhaps it was a holiday hangover still lingering. But despite the rollout having been initiated over 10 days ago, many Pixel users still don’t have the update. Subreddits dedicated to Pixel phones are rife with users complaining they haven’t received the January update yet. These complaints span across multiple Pixel devices, but we’re seeing the majority of reports for the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 10 series. And these reports are consistent, regardless of whether their devices are unlocked or tied to a carrier. A handful of reports also hint at Pixel 9 or 9a not having received the update either.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code for a new feature that will let users delete all their contributed incident reports. The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month.

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction.

Yesterday, we saw a leak that said Apple’s next flagship phone, the iPhone 18 Pro, might tuck its Face ID sensor under the display, in the process shrinking the now-trademark Dynamic Island cluster and shifting it to the left. Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

Bixby hasn’t seemed like much of a priority for Samsung lately, but it looks like that’s changing with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Earlier this morning, Samsung announced a beta for the latest version of its assistant, “upgraded to operate as a conversational device agent” that leverages Perplexity to answer complex questions. Samsung, oddly enough, has since removed its announcement, with its URL currently pointing to a Page not found error. According to the announcement’s text as preserved by Droid Life , the new Bixby will let you control your device’s settings and features by making requests in natural language. For questions about topics other than your phone itself, Bixby will connect to Perplexity to pull info from the web.",

Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears.
