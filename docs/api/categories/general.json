Sawyer and other viewers began tallying up some of the show's other tabletop inaccuracies. Here are a few, from both this season and prior: Commenter Blake Barton notes that the show's characterization of the Sorcerer is anachronistic, with the modern class not appearing until 3rd Edition in 2000. A roll of seven when casting Prismatic Spray, resulting in the violet version of the spell, is described as causing blindness (\"WRONG!\" Sawyer hollered over a clip of this moment ).

Talking to PC Gamer associate editor Ted Litchfield, Fallout 3 lead artist Istvan Pely said it was an uncanny sort of fun. \"It's all locations that many people on the team were very familiar with. And we didn't take it seriously. It was fun to just be like, 'Hey, let's, let's blow all this up,'\" he said. \"I felt almost like, 'Wow, we're getting away with this?'

Like XCOM, it's a turn-based tactics game with the familiar shield symbols designating cover and blue grid representing movement range. Spend a bunch of action points on moving and your character will transform into vehicle mode to cover the distance, which is a nice touch, and they have ultimate abilities available when you fill up their Energon meter.

Not only have all 12 fights been an absolute joy to play, but the series has some of the strongest identity and cast of characters the game has seen in a good long while. That's thanks in no small part to each fighter having a unique theme song—something that is not afforded to every raid in this game—and I firmly believe the Arcadion series simply would not have hit the same without Soken's excellent and varied musical work on it. A world where I didn't have Bee My Honey permanently stuck in my head? That's a world I don't wanna live in.

Like most FromSoftware fans, I was resistant to the concept of an Elden Ring spinoff you're supposed to play almost entirely in multiplayer. I also recognised its obvious limitations. Despite being a roguelike all about team interplay, as you use your limited time to accrue as much power and pertinent passives as possible while journeying to battle the Nightlord, one thing stuck out to me: It doesn't have comms. Unless you're playing with friends through Discord, you have to limit your interactions to tagging. Predictably, this leads to endless frustrations and horror stories about incompetent teammates, plenty of which you can find if you peruse the game's subreddit. It's an important flaw to recognise, because if I didn't have two other FromSoftware-fanatic friends with which to play Nightreign, I would've quit. As you can see from all…",

But Straftat is also one of the best shooters of 2025, too, thanks to the immense amount of support the Lemaitre brothers have poured into, essentially doubling the map count since launch. Now, one half of Straftat's developers, Léonard Lemaitre, has announced a new game called Vholume , a Mirror's Edge style first-person platformer set in a vast, dystopian city. While Straftat is the easier reference here, Vholume arguably has more in common with Babbdi , which shares the brutalist aesthetic of both Straftat and Vholume.

Here, mapmakers enthralled by id Software's 1996 shooter have gathered to honour architecture's moodiest style, constructing levels designed to evoke its austere, concrete minimalism. The first Brutalist Jam occurred in 2022, spawning 35 maps that were bundled together and released as a single mod. A second Brutalist Jam took place the following year, producing 30 more delightfully grey, angular constructions to blast your way through. Both Jams seemed like impressive achievements at the time. But this year's Brutalist Jam blows both previous events out of the water. After kicking off in October, the Quake Brutalist Jam 3 has received a whopping 75 entries created by the Quake community. For context, the original version of Quake contains 37 maps. Why has this Jam proved so much more popular than the previous ones? Well, it might be partly down to word of mouth spreading, and the Jam didn't run last year, which likely encouraged people who feared they missed out to take part this year. But on top of that, Quake Brutalist Jam 3 doesn't just use vanilla Quake as its foundation…",

Early on there's one where you're hurled into a town as it's besieged by the undead, running through collapsing buildings until you can get to a ballista and shoot a shambling zombie cyclops. The next one happens when the magic crystal you're in town to deliver gets stolen right in front of you by a ghoul, and you have to chase it across rooftops in the darkness and rain. To keep up you jump across gaps, clamber up chains, squeeze through windows, and don't fall to your death as timbers creak and collapse beneath you. It's like the chase from Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth only in reverse, because here you're pursuing rather than being pursued and also you've got a snowflake's chance of getting it right first go.

The most recent release target we had put Ark 2 in 2027, \"if all goes to plan.\" All did not go to plan, and Studio Wildcard is now aiming to get Ark 2 out the door sometime in 2028, according to an Epic Games report . \"That’s our intention,\" studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz said. \"One of the things about doing Ark 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases. Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called Ark 2.\" Stieglitz said that many mechanics and features in Ark 2 will be introduced first in Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion for Ark: Survival Ascended that will also serve as \"a prequel to Ark 2 that basically directly ties into that narrative.\" Le…",

DBOX02 Pro is a 4K gaming projector that wants to take over your living room with thumping speakers, immense projection size, and a wildly adaptable auto keystone. It's an attempt to replace your TV and your Hi-Fi system with something altogether compact and stylish, that won't falter when the sun comes shining in. While there are plenty of TV replacement projectors out there vying for that spot in your home entertainment system, few have the chops to nail gaming too. That's where the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro comes in. Smooth and shiny on the front, this mostly matt black cube features subtly rounded edges and a lightly curved facade. It's a modern aesthetic that proudly flaunts a touch of those lovable retro vibes, without being smothered in buttons and dust-catching greebles. The projector itself sits atop a seamless stand that grips it on either side. It allows for a 360 degrees rotation and 120 degree tilt for ceiling projection. There's none of that twisting the little feet to get the perfect angle, either, since the DBOX02 Pro comes with an impeccable InstanPro AI auto key…",

Fortunately, Death Howl hasn’t been made by evil money men, but slightly-less evil developers who clearly understand what makes good deckbuilders and soulslikes tick. Even if they’re slightly too infatuated with a difficulty curve they purchased from the rectangle factory. I thought all deckbuilders had to be roguelikes by law, so it’s paradoxically a little refreshing to play one that follows a more traditional game structure. You play a grieving mother who’s in denial about her young son’s death (oh, Merry Christmas by the way!) and who’s chased him into the spirit realm in the hopes of getting him back.

Trendforce recently shared its findings that OLED monitor shipments grew 65% from this period last year, and 12% from the previous quarter. With a total estimated shipment of 2.62 million in the third quarter of 2025, this means that OLED monitor shipments have grown by 84% year-on-year. Trendforce also lays out which companies these orders are from. Asus sits at the very top of the pile, enjoying a 21.9% share. You can see the full stats below. Company Market Share Asus 21.9% Samsung 18% MSI 14.4% LG Electronics 12.9% Others 32.7% Naturally, shipping figures and total sales are different metrics, though they are linked. As items sell better, stores will naturally stock more. It's also worth noting that Trendforce's analysis encompasses all OLED monitors, not just OLED gaming monitors. For example, Asus has a whole range of ProArt OLED productivity monitors, which definitely helps that market share. Trendforce's report from last year put OLED monitor shipments at 1.44 million units, growing by 181% compared to the previous year. So, while th…",

In a chat with Bad Company 2's lead designer, David Goldfarb, he says that he thinks the team would \"want to do it\", but after all these years they're now spread across the industry—including at Embark, the studio behind Arc Raiders. \"So there's that part of it, where that band's not getting back together to make that game. But another band could make it.\" But that would require Battlefield Studios—made up of DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion and Motive—and EA itself to take a massive risk, something the publisher isn't exactly famous for doing. \"If they choose to make it, they are choosing, in their own minds, to make a product that is going to have a smaller subset of buyers,\" says Goldfarb, \"just by virtue of the fact that humour is subjective.

However, it's now being used as an unlikely piece of evidence in another bizarre tale of alleged corporate espionage. Amazon began to suspect something was amiss when it looked at the keystroke data from a new IT hire. To the company's knowledge, the employee was US-based so there should have been a comfortably less than 100 millisecond delay between them typing commands on their corporate laptop, and those inputs reaching the head office in Seattle. However, the delay was in fact 110 milliseconds, suggesting the employee was based further afield than first thought. Amazon’s Chief Security Officer Stephen Schmidt communicated to Bloomberg a bizarre bigger picture. It turns out the employee with the lag was in fact a North Korean attempting to skirt international sanctions and funnel money back into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (or DPRK) via remote work. After a few days of investigation and monitoring, they were ousted from Amazon's systems. According to Schmidt, the company has thwart…",
