Country! with a tender track that looks at life from the perspective of man&#8217;s best friend. Meanwhile, bluegrass group The Infamous Stringdusters offer up a country-tilted new track, while Chase Rice brings a rustic, introspective new song, and Lauren Watkins and John Morgan team up for a new collaboration. Check out all of these and more in&nbsp; Billboard &#8216;s roundup of some of the best country, bluegrass and/or Americana songs of the week below. Dasha, &#8220;Train&#8221; &#8220;Austin&#8221; hitmaker Dasha trades boot-stompin&#8217; rhythms for tender introspection on her latest song. Elevated by slashes of pedal steel and dobro, &#8220;Train&#8221; depicts the slow accumulation of moments that prove one&#8217;s transition from stranger in a new town to resident, when the new space begins to feel more familiar. The sound of a train that was once jarring becomes background noise, pictures hung on a wall makes a new place feel cozy and newly-forged friendships begin to give a sense of commun…",

    "body": "Morgan Wallen ’s I&#8217;m the Problem leads Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart (dated Sept. 27) for the 18th consecutive week. This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 204, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black ar…",

Wearing long shorts and a T-shirt with the word &#8220;holy.&#8221; on the front and &#8220;pray for me&#8221; on the back, Bieber bops across the lawn, singing and gesticulating along to the tune&#8217;s chilled-out beat. Shot and edited by Rory Kramer (Chainsmokers, Shawn Mendes), the clip has a casual, low-fi vibe matching the surprise, low-key Swag roll-out. Bieber posted the clip on his Instagram with the caption, &#8220; see u in april. &#8220; The singer also made it a family affair, posting a second Insta from the polo fields in which he&#8217;s carrying his one-year-old son, Jack Blues Bieber, and a second one in which he and wife Hailey Bieber each hold one of the toddler&#8217;s hands as they walk together over the lush grass. &#8220;Speed Demon&#8221; landed at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week on the chart.
