While it's hardly a proper horror story, Windows' update and shutdown reboot glitch is an annoyance that's plagued PCs for years. Now, it's finally getting fixed. According to Windows Latest , when you select 'update and shutdown', your machine will actually update and switch off starting in Windows 11 25H2 Build 26200.7019 and Windows 11 24H2 Build 26100.7019. The fix for this annoying reboot glitch already featured in October's optional update, KB5067036. If you happened to skip that—and who could blame you —the fix will also ship as part of Microsoft's regular Patch Tuesday update. This rolls out on the second Tuesday of every month, with the next one falling on November 11. Microsoft itself hasn't said a great deal about the issue, what caused it, or even how exactly it was fixed. The most they're saying now is well hidden within a support document pertaining to the KB5067036 update . In the drop-down titled Wi…",

If there's one thing that can end your Minecraft session early, it's a Creeper. Fortunately, a mod has come to fruition that forces Creepers to ask you permission before they blow up, which is great for anyone lacking as much spatial awareness as me and doesn't often see them coming. As posted to YouTube by SectorFive , the Creeper Consent mod is exactly what it says on the tin. If you have a close encounter with the mob, just as they are about to explode, a screen will pop up, essentially asking you whether or not they can explode. Obviously, the immediate and only appropriate answer is no, which will make the Creeper disappear entirely when selected. Of course, if you let the Creeper do its business, you'll have to deal with the repercussions as normal, too. As satisfied as I would be with the consequences…",

Ayaneo, arguably one of the best handheld gaming PC makers, is finally taking a step into the mobile market, and early signs suggest it could be pretty unique. The Ayaneo Phone just got its first-ever teaser on the Ayaneo YouTube channel , opening with the phrase \"When mobile phone meets handheld soul\". The marketing language isn't done here, though, as Ayaneo calls it \"a mobile phone truly made for gamers\" and suggests it will be coming soon. This teaser only shows the back of the phone, which includes two camera lenses and a flashlight, but it certainly looks sleek under the intentionally low lighting. A quick adjustment of the image, and upping the contrast, shows notches on the bottom and top of the right side that look a little like bumpers, plus a few buttons in the middle of the right side, which could be lock and volume controls.

However, the most popular add-on currently available on the Marketplace doesn't add terrors or a huge variety of wildlife to the game. Instead, it focuses on one thing and one thing only: owls . Obviously everyone loves Minecraft's existing mob selection, but I can't lie, I do find myself getting a bit bored of seeing nothing but pigs, chickens, cows, and sheep. That said, I still get incredibly excited on the odd occasion I stumble across a fox, so I can understand why so many people have jumped at the opportunity to add an all-new creature to the game.

    "body": "There have been some incredible weapons in the history of PC gaming, and while not exclusive to the genre, there's no doubting that most of them have come out of FPS games. From Painkiller's Stake Gun, through to Quake's Railgun, and onto Unreal Tournament's Flak Cannon, among many others, there are many iconic weapons in first-person shooters. But what is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history? That's an interesting question, and one that when asked by Apogee Entertainment's X account, was answered by none other than the grandfather of FPS games, John Romero, he of Doom fame. Super Shotgun. https://t.co/TikpaEHwhr November 3, 2025 Romero's response was the objectively correct one in my opinion, too, with Romero voting for the 'Super Shotgun', as introduced to gaming originally in Doom 2. Many other gamers agreed with the FPS legend, with comments replying with sentiments such as, 'Agreed! Double barrel in Doom 2', as well as 'it's a scientific fact' and 'it's the Super Shotgun for me too'. One reply simply states, 'I strongly agree, Mr Romero'. How polite. Naturally, there are plenty of other suggestions for most satisfying weapon in gaming, too, ranging from Doom's Plasma …",

One is great at art, another is great at programming. And to share the vision, it's a lot less work.\" With his John Lennon glasses and a tweed newsboy cap corralling graying sideburns, Kimura is the Platonic ideal of an elder statesman indie dev.

Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire.

It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients.

The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements.

But it's actually the latest in a long line of spooky experiences from the game design wunderkind. Previous projects include the lo-fi paranoia generator It Steals , the survival horror throwback Dead Seater , and the physics-heavy frightfest The Upturned . In short, Zeekerss is highly prolific, which makes it all the stranger that his latest game has been in development for longer than any of the above. Welcome to the Dark Place is a creepy single-player text adventure inspired by the likes of Zork and Kentucky Route Zero , which Zeekerss' has been working on for more than a decade. Speaking to GamesRadar , Zeekerss revealed why Welcome to the Dark Place had taken him so long to develop. Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained. This meant Zeekerss could implement his ideas very quickly. \"As soon as I think of something, it can be playable.\" But t…",

    "body": "When REPO announced it would be receiving a bunch of new monsters in September, I naively thought they wouldn't be too scary. Most of REPO's existing critters are unsettling, especially the Upscream and the Animal, but there's nothing that really petrifies you. The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch. However, one of REPO's newest addition…",

Yep, Schedule 1's Halloween update missed the ghost train by two whole days. Developer TVGS apologised for the unseasonal delay. \"Sorry this update is a couple of days late—I was originally planning on skipping the open beta and going straight to full release. At the last minute released [sic] I should probably play it safe and publicly beta test it for at least a day.\" A sensible decision, I reckon. While the delay is unfortunate, in practical terms it doesn't matter that much. The Halloween update isn't overly Halloweeny in terms of theme or aesthetics. You won't see any drug dealers dressed up as werewolves or vampires while engaged in their own highly illegal game of Trick or Treat (The treat is drugs. The trick? Gun.) Instead, the update's main addition is a sewer system running beneath Schedule 1's open world. \"The sewers offer a new way to navigate Hyland Point witho…",

The latter debuted to mixed Steam reviews and muted sales when it carved its way into early access back in January, resulting in layoffs at Heart Machine and work on Hyper Light Breaker ceasing prematurely . But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

I'm also not alone—if we go by Steam reviews, almost everyone who plays this thing agrees. It's got a sterling 98% \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score for English reviews . Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked.

In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts.
