    "body": "Blake Lively’s personal text messages with Taylor Swift have now been made public, the latest in the ongoing litigation connected to the movie It Ends With Us . As previously reported , a judge determined that the friends’ conversations about the working environment on set are relevant to Lively’s sexual harassment and retaliation claims against co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, prevailed in court last June on the issue of Swift’s text messages, which have taken center stage in Lively’s lawsuit. Some of those have come to light. This week, several batches of back-and-forths have been released in which Baldoni is allegedly labelled a “doofus director,” a “clown” and a “bitch” who runs with a “gaggle of supervillains.” In one exchange from December 2024, labelled “Exhibit 89” and seen by Billboard , Swift apparently references a favorable published story on Baldoni, quipping: “I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin.” Swift also likens the broader situation with Baldoni and others to “a horror film no one knows is taking place.” In an earlier message, chunks of which are redacted, L…",

The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite features a more compact and sleeker design, much like the recently revealed Communicator from Clicks. Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

Previously leaked specs suggest the device will feature high-end cameras: a 200MP “super large” primary camera, a 200MP “mid-telephoto” camera, and a 50MP 10x periscope zoom camera The phone is expected to debut in China and globally in March, marking an unusual international push from OPPO’s ultra tier. If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.

You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

News that ASUS hit pause on smartphone development , quite possibly for good, has perhaps just ruined our chance at seeing another novel and brilliant compact smartphone . It’s genuinely disappointing. Ever since the colorful little ASUS Zenfone 10 launched back in mid-2023, fans (myself included) have wondered if we’ll ever see another compact phone of this quality. 2024 slunk by with little more than a teaser of future possibilities. Instead, ASUS banked hard on the gargantuan Zenfone 11 Ultra. 2025 passed with virtual silence, and now it seems that any residual hope has been snuffed out.",

Back then, its Galaxy A54 5G challenged Google’s Pixel 7a as its closest rival, combining a triple-camera system and a robust 5,000mAh battery to win users away from the simplicity of Pixel UI and the reliability of Google’s image processing. By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears.

An existing notification that alerts users their ring is disconnected will be updated to include the battery charge percentage at the time of disconnection. Code for these changes is present in the Galaxy Ring Manager app, but we’re not sure when to expect the changes to go live. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring uses notifications on your phone to keep you up to speed about its battery and connectivity — for example, alerts when battery charge gets down to 15 percent or when connection with the ring has been lost. Today, we’ve seen evidence that those notifications will soon be a little smarter, ideally helping users avoid missing out on tracked health data.

Pricing has yet to be revealed, but this is billed as a premium ‘endgame’ handheld. AYANEO held its first product sharing session of the year this morning, and it finally gave us a look at one of the most anticipated small gaming handhelds this year. The Pocket S Mini, which was first teased in September 2025, brings the ultra-premium all-metal design of the Pocket S series down to a size that actually fits in your pocket. The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September.

Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department.

However, I’ve noticed a growing trend in the last couple of years that’s only picked up more steam in the last six months. I’m talking about the fact that phones like the Pixel 10 series , Samsung Galaxy S25 , and OnePlus 15 all feel like iPhones. And I’m really sick of this lazy approach to smartphone design.",

I didn’t quite believe that the technology would be so pervasive years later, and such is the speed of technology, a screen that folds just once isn’t enough anymore. Before the end of the year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold . It’s the latest phone to compress a small tablet into a candy-bar form factor, but while this larger, multifolding device is impressive as a technological achievement, in practice, Samsung could’ve and perhaps should’ve offered consumers more.",

Ranging from the annoyingly expensive iPad Pro to the M-series iPad Air, Apple’s tablet has always been the default slate in my bag for a few simple reasons. It wasn’t just the premium choice, it was the safe choice, and frankly, the only choice that made sense if you needed a solid balance of hardware and software. But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool. Making the switch from an iPad to a utilitarian mid-range Android tablet might not please my brand and ecosystem-conscious mind, but the reality is that it does everything I …",

Although this is still a patent, and patents have a tendency to remain theoretical hogwash, there’s actually a reason why this particular one might end up in an actual product like the Pixel 12: the European Union’s battery regulation .
