Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Hideo Kojima on stage to present the video, which shows in-engine footage from Unreal Engine 5. The footage shows what could be the protagonist, played by Sophia Lillis, entering a morbid-looking room, and approaching a maudlin little table with an elaborate candle display. As they start to light the candles, weird, scary stuff starts to happen. Kojima reiterated how the game will blur games and film, without going into any specifics on exactly how. Spencer's comments were similarly unhelpful: he said that OD was innovating \"in gameplay, story and player engagement\". Microsoft is offering technical support on the project. It certainly looks a lot like P.T. The sound design is deliciously oppressive, and the footage is mostly first-person. Kojima wouldn't be drawn on how far into development the game is, so that's completely up in the air for now. OD will bear the subtitle Knock, which Kojima explained has everything to do with his fear of knocking (and I think P.T. bears that out). Despite the video's focus on lighting can…",

It's got all the makings of something right up my alley with Spirit Hunter artist Kera and Higurashi When They Cry creator Ryukishi07, plus a bigger focus on its Japanese horror influences. So I was more than relieved to see our Silent Hill f review from my colleague, Elie Gould, sing its praises and call it an entry that can go \"shoulder to shoulder with other goliaths in the series\" while taking risks and doing its own thing. As for when the rest of us can play… well, that depends on your platform and when you buy it. Here's a quick rundown on the Silent Hill f release date and launch time schedule, plus how its advanced access works. When is the Silent Hill f unlock time?

While it retains its unique bullet-hose, explosive personality, the Kaoson looks a little different than you might remember. Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses. If you want to add it to your collection (and you should), here's what you need to do. How to get the Kaoson in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm the Kaoson from Primordial Guardian Origo, the final boss of the Terminus Range vault . To access the Arch of Origo vault, you need to find all three vault key fragments in Terminus Range. Once inside, fight through three waves of enemies until you reach Origo.

According to YouTuber The Phawx , the device feels \"comically light\" without the external battery, and he likes it a lot with the battery slapped on the back. He says, \"I just ultimately prefer the battery pack on at all times.\" Effectively, with the Win 5, you can either keep it plugged in all the time, or connect a battery to the back of the device via a port and locking mechanism. Think of how the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons work, with a clip letting them slide up and out. It is not, however, hot swappable, so plugging out the battery entirely shuts it down. The Phawx points out that the battery strapped onto the back covers some of the device's intake fans, though he hasn't had the chance to fully test the thermals yet. He did, however, notice the fans felt a little louder with the pack on. In exchange for this strange battery system, you get the full-fat Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, complete with 40 RDNA …",

Speaking to Archipel in a new video about his writing process, in which Taro wears his trademark \"Emil\" mask (a character from Nier), the creator says he had no idea where to start with Automata, other than knowing he wanted a new \"starting point each time\" and \"something different to write\" for projects. \"Drakengard depicts a dark and violent story, whereas Nier Replicant is themed around sorrow,\" says Taro. \"At the time, there wasn't really something set in stone that I wanted to do.

As spotted by Hackaday , the half-hour-long video of the YouTuber making a 'portable' Xbox Original is sort of like the lovechild of a mad scientist, a teacher, and a stream of consciousness. After grabbing an Xbox that isn't working, James figures out that the DVD drive is flagging a hard drive issue, and fixes the DVD drive by replacing a tiny failing resistor with four separate, much bigger resistors, then hot-glueing them down. This is subsequently followed by smacking the top of the Xbox until the disk tray comes out. Then, after fixing the original Xbox, James takes it apart again and starts throwing the bits of plastic he doesn't need on the floor. Taking apart this plastic is important to get the central motherboard and necessary components as small as possible, and he replaces the big unwieldy hard drive with a CompactFlash drive, saving a little more space. …",

In a recent, brief chat with YouTuber HarrisonShippp , Ogg was asked how excited he was for GTA 6's release next year. \"I feel nothing inside,\" answered Ogg, definitively. And just in case you're wondering if that's a more general cry for help, he quickly made clear he was speaking specifically about GTA: \"I'm not a gamer. I've never played a videogame, so I feel absolutely nothing.\" Which, hey, fair enough. Some voice actors get super deep into their roles—like the cast of Baldur's Gate 3—and for others it's just a paycheque. Neither's an illegitimate approach, and Ogg has made clear before that he's not keen on GTA fans essentially treating him like Trevor in real life.

My inherent distrust after years of being lied to by the internet urged caution at first, but HandowShandowed looks legit. For one, they have a library of Hollow Knight challenge videos going back years, and while they never explicitly lay out the setup they use or show real world footage of their inputs, their gameplay footage across the two Hollow Knights is synced perfectly. I suppose a TAS-style tool might be able to replicate the effect, but HandowShandowed's play has the believable messiness and flow of a human at the controls—at a certain point, this would be harder to fake than just do .

Once Nvidia's magic \"make it run better\" juice, DLSS and its alternative AI upscalers have become worryingly mandatory to run many of the most graphically demanding games, so why add it to Legends of the Zone, a remaster pack whose oldest game, Shadow of Chornobyl, came out all the way back in 2007? User Avdievs in the Steam discussion page for the patch points out that DLSS' texture filtering and antialiasing components can be desirable even in a game that should be easy to run⁠—and Legends of the Zone can be much more of a performance hog than the original releases. \"That DLSS is the perfect option for the ones wishing to play with their insanely taxing indirect lighting in 4k 60+ fps,\" wrote user Spleen, referring to a new graphical feature introduced with Legends of the Zone's enhanced global illumination.

It's a demo that delivers. Thrasher is a kinetic, engaging little rhythm game that boasts some excellent audio and visual design. It's a pretty classic score-chasing, time attack game where you're always trying to make more and more skillful moves with your \"magnificent space eel\" in order to hit circling motions and rack up a higher combo. The visuals are excellent in that nearly-off-putting, psychedelic way I want from this kind of game. There's a glowing space eel that evolves to get ever-larger as it flies across bizarre and sometimes mesmerizing landscapes. There's a huge baby with glowing eyes, which is a bit upsetting, but hey, look at that glowing eel. The music is, of course, great at inducing that flow state you want from a good rhythm game.

The first Baldur's Gate changed all that, with great dungeons, an epic quest, and most important of all, a deep cast of characters with their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities—and who, just like in the real world, would sometimes gel or clash with their fellows in unexpected ways.

The Internet Archive team hasn’t said much, either, only offering a short update on its blog stating, “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.” It’s the end to a case that was originally filed back in 2023 and marks yet another clash between copyright protection and content preservation. The “Great 78 Project” at the heart of the case aimed to digitize and preserve 78 rpm shellac records , or “78s”, which were made roughly from 1898 through the 1950s.

Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made.

The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla.
