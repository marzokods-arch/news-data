I’ve had thin hard shells, bulky Otterbox armors, flip-case leather, faux-leather, aramide fiber, TPU, slimy and transparent, colorful and rigid — you name it. Recently, every year or two, I’ve also tried Google’s official case for my Pixel phones just to see if it was worth using, and every time I did, it started well and ended in disappointment. I didn’t learn my lesson. I just bought the official Pixelsnap case for my Pixel 10 Pro XL (), and although there’s a lot to love here, I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Here’s why.",

The discovery comes courtesy of Reddit user u/spaceuniversal, who shared the find on the r/kindle subreddit . Their post points readers to KindlePlay.com , a simple but surprisingly delightful website designed specifically for Kindle’s built-in web browser.

This appears to be a consequence of the recent dispute between YouTube and Disney, as Movies Anywhere is owned by the latter. With this change, users will still be able to access their already synced library from YouTube or Google Play, but that may not be forever. Over the past few weeks, Google and Disney have been quarreling over licensing fees, which resulted in Disney recently removing its live TV channels from YouTube TV and discontinuing the option to purchase its shows and movies on Google’s platforms. Neither giant is backing down, and the punches won’t stop landing. In a more recent setback, Google is losing access to Movies Anywhere — a digital library management platform that allows you to sync your content from different apps into a single library.

Voice assistants from tech brands like Google and Amazon have recently undergone significant enhancements powered by AI. Both Alexa+ and Gemini, which has replaced Google Assistant , are now available to users for testing and critique. In the meantime, Apple’s ambitions to catch up to its competitors with Siri continue to drag on . Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner .

I was surprised by the sheer amount of tech packed into something so tiny, and by the promises of powerful, continuous health tracking from a stylish ring that almost made me feel like I’d stepped into the future. Four months in, that’s where the honeymoon phase ended. The hard realities of current smart ring technology became impossible to ignore.

If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",
