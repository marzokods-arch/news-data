Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

Although Android 16 has been available on Pixels for a while now, many other Android phones are just now starting to get a taste. For example, Nothing recently rolled out the Nothing OS 4.0 beta , which is based on Android 16. This beta is only available for the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Pro, Phone 3, and eventually the Phone 3a. However, it appears a developer may have found a way to get the OS running on a Phone 1.

Closer viewing shows One UI failed to keep pace largely due to user error. OnePlus’s latest OxygenOS 16 update is set to begin rolling out broadly next month . The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

Samsung’s plan to end OneDrive integration in its Gallery app now has a date. According to a screenshot shared by X user Nirmal Sri , the feature is set to stop working on April 11, 2026. Once the cutoff arrives, users will no longer be able to sync their photos or videos from Samsung Gallery directly to OneDrive, with the company steering them toward Samsung Cloud instead.

The Edge was supposed to replace the Plus in next year’s Galaxy S family, but those plans are now apparently scrapped. The report cites extremely low sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge as the reason for the S26 Edge’s cancellation. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of poor Edge sales , and Samsung seemingly doesn’t want to risk repeating itself in 2026.",
