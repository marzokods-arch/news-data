Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.) Remember, not every letter I show you is the first letter of the game name! And B sure to let us know how U scored in the comments, K?",

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it. For whatever reason, geese can drown in the world of Where Winds Meet. They won't even attempt to escape as they slowly take damage and fa…",

The 2000s were a time of social, political, and cultural transfiguration: The global paradigm was reeling beneath the impact of 9/11 and the United States' ensuing War on Terror, the internet was ascending as the universal medium of informational and commercial exchange, and everywhere people wondered: How would director Peter Jackson follow his success with the landmark Lord of the Rings trilogy?

That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive.

Over 500 reviews, not a single one of them negative. That is until this week, when one cook spoiled the broth with a red thumbs-down among the sea of blue approval. The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews? Just go play the game, it's great!\" But it's especially bold to post a negative review that breaks that lovely 100% positive streak that's been rolling along for months—just for a joke.

The news was announced by the company's chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, who claimed in a press briefing that the technology is \"pretty accurate\" and can estimate the age of users between five and 25, apparently with an accuracy \"within one to two years.\" Roblox says it is establishing what it believes will become \"a new industry standard\", and one of the key elements is limiting communications between child and adult users. The feature is now live, though voluntary, with the requirement for either \"Facial Age Estimation\" or ID verification becoming mandatory worldwide from December 2025 to January 2026. Users who do not wish to use chat features do not have to complete an age check. \"Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become Trusted Connections with people they know,\" says the Roblox announcement .

As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side.

That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing.

How to complete the Fun! Fun! Fun! quest in Disney Dreamlight Valley To begin the Fun! Fun! Fun! quest, you need to follow Tigger to Pixie Flats. You won't be able to access this area yet as it's blocked by two big \"STOP\" statues. When you speak to Tigger and explain you'll need to get another potion from Tinkerbell to make your pickaxe stronger, he'll beg you not to leave and says he'll make a Tigger potion instead if you gather the right ingredients.

(Image credit: Furcula) It's not the basic premise that's so confusing, though it is odd: you play a mouse living in the sewers, who must battle his way up through the corrupt society above. The clearest inspiration is The Binding of Isaac, with winding dungeon levels, top-down shooting, and a cute-but-gross art style. The biggest twist is the morsels themselves. Each run you choose a card that allows you to transform into one—a kind of ugly little monster with its own unique attack style and special ability. New cards can be found over the course of the run, and you can hold up to three at a time, so you can shift between forms.
