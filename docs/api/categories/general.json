    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon says early 6G devices could arrive “as early as 2028.” Amon and others expect 6G to play a key role in a future where AI is deeply ingrained in daily life. We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

Sure, if one manufacturer keeps knocking it out of the park, year after year, we’re definitely going to want to check out their latest offerings — but if that’s the only brand you pay attention to, you risk doing yourself a major disservice. Among companies making and selling Android phones, Samsung’s held a prominent spot for years, and to a distressingly large number of users, “Android” might as well be synonymous with “Galaxy.” But even with so many users turning to Samsung phones every time they’re shopping for a new handset, could we maybe convince some of you to see if the grass is any greener in another OEM’s pasture?",

While I did own a bunch of OnePlus phones in the past and have hands-on experience with just about every major brand out there, Pixel remains my phone of choice. Pixels aren’t perfect — no device ever is — but they have all the ingredients that make up a great phone , at least for my personal wants and needs. Here are the five key reasons why the brand is so close to my heart.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

The update is currently live in South Korea, but we expect wider availability to be announced soon. Meanwhile, it has also concluded testing for the Galaxy Watch 7, indicating a stable update may be coming soon. Samsung recently rolled out stable One UI 8 to the Galaxy S25 series and has been testing beta builds on nearly a dozen other flagships and mid-range devices. Besides phones, the One UI 8 Watch is also set to arrive on a range of supported Galaxy Watch models. While the Galaxy Watch 8 series came preinstalled with One UI 8 Watch, the Watch Ultra followed soon after. Meanwhile, a beta has been underway for the last generation Galaxy Watch 7 series, and the program is now being extended to the older Galaxy Watch 6. According to a user’s post on Samsung Community forums , One UI 8 Watch beta is now available for the Galaxy Watch 6. It’s safe to presume that the update also applies to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, as the two devices share the same hardware.",

We previously reported that Google may be planning to merge Chrome OS and Android, unifying the two operating systems. This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

Not all users are eligible; the discount offer may be US-exclusive. Google jacked up the prices of its Nest Aware subscriptions in July, bumping fees by 25 to 33% on both monthly and annual plans. The move prompted backlash online, with commenters around the internet (including here on Android Authority) declaring that they canceled their service or planned to in response to the hikes. Now, though, you might be able to hang onto your subscription a little longer without overpaying. As reported by 9to5Google , Google’s trying to appease disgruntled subscribers. Some users who attempt to cancel their Nest Aware plans are being offered significant discounts to keep their subscriptions active.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR The Google Play Store can now handle up to six app downloads or updates at a time. Previously, the Play Store only supported three simultaneous downloads or updates. In the past, if you downloaded or updated multiple apps in the Play Store, you would have to wait as those apps downloaded or updated one by one. Google eventually upped this restriction to three apps at a time, and even tested raising it to four. Now it looks like the Play Store has pretty much doubled the limit. Spotted by the folks over at SammyGuru , it appears there’s been a significant improvement in the number of updates the Play Store can handle. In its testing, the outlet was able to get up to six apps updating at the same time. Any app past six remained in the “Pending” state until a new spot opened up.",

By November of this year, 92% of upgrades and 85% of new activations are expected to be app-based. The aggressive shift risks alienating both customers and employees if the app experience falls short. Just yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s current CEO will be stepping down in November, signaling a shift to an AI-centric, digital-first future. At the time, I suggested this would likely mean customer service would move further away from retail, as well as human reps. Now, a new leak on Reddit suggests this ramp-up is coming sooner rather than later. According to an internal roadmap released by a disgruntled salesperson, nearly 100% of major customer service actions will be handled through the T Life app by the end of 2026.

    "summary": "Google's latest Pixel 10 videos are definitely a vibe, but how successful is their message?",
    "body": "TL;DR Google has published new promo videos for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro. The Pixel 10 clip is classic Google, criticizing Apple fans for their “vanilla” choices. The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Background The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has reviewed flight, ground test, and published data on ultraviolet-induced degradation of silicone based thermal control coatings. Analysis has shown, for at least one silicone coating, that bake-out plays an important role in ultraviolet (UV) degradation, indicating that UV interaction with paint volatiles, and not the structural material, is the primary source of coating discoloration. Discussion Spacecraft temperature is primarily determined by the absorptivity and emissivity of the vehicle’s coating. Absorptivity is the fraction of the sun’s irradiance that is absorbed, and emissivity determines the amount of infrared power that is emitted. The combination of these properties, along with additional heat from internal sources and other external radiation sources, determines the spacecraft’s thermal environment. Choosing an appropriate coating, referred to as a thermal control coating, is key to keeping the vehicle within a desired temperature range. However, these coatings can degrade, (i.e., darken), in low earth orbit (LEO), primarily due to solar UV exposure, complicating the choice of coating. Zinc-oxide (ZnO) scatte…",

We’ve already found a bunch of interesting new features in Samsung One UI 8.5, but we’re not the only ones who have been tinkering with the builds. A leaker on X claims the update will make the Samsung control panel “completely customizable,” and has shared some images as proof. According to tipster @theonecid , who shared three screenshots of the feature, One UI 8.5 seems to go beyond the usual row shuffling already available in Samsung’s interface. It looks as if the whole panel is much more modular, with a vast scope to rearrange it and remove parts that you don’t want to see.",

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging.

While it starts at just $1.99/month for 100GB storage, things get extremely messy and unfair if you subscribe to anything including and above the $9.99/month 2TB Premium plan. What started as a simple way to get extra cloud storage and some benefits has morphed into a Frankenstein bundle of AI perks no one asked for, leaving users like me wondering what we’re actually paying for. The reality is that Google is pushing its AI agenda on Google One subscribers, and it’s starting to really bother me.",

The OnePlus 15 is coming soon, and its updated design is already making rounds on the internet. Multiple rumors in the past have hinted at the redesigned camera bump on the upcoming flagship. And we recently came across purported hands-on images of the OnePlus 15 , which highlight the changes on the back. Although the authenticity of these images could not be ascertained, another teaser from earlier today suggests this change might be legitimate after all. The teaser does not come from OnePlus, but its parent company OPPO, which is set to unveil its flagship Find X9 series on October 16. That is just one day after the reveal of ColosOS 16, which has been confirmed to drive the OnePlus 15 in China. OPPO has been teasing the Find X9 series over the last couple of weeks.

These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next?
