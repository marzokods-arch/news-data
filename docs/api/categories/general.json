Compared to its predecessors, the Pixel 10 Pro is better made, the software is more reliable, and I feel that it better contends with the competition from Samsung and Apple, even if benchmarks don’t agree. Some changes aren’t for the better, though. There are software and hardware features from older Google phones that I miss and would love to see return in future Pixels and Android releases.",

I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025.

    "body": "Credit: Redditor Direct-Till-2680 TL;DR A questionable leak has revealed an apparent Galaxy S26 Ultra dummy unit in a saturated orange color. This color has received a negative reception online along with claims that Samsung is copying Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro phones. We’d suggest you take this leak with a major helping of salt, though. Update: October 8, 2025 (9:22 AM ET): It sounds like the source of this image is more nebulous. Twitter user Najiulloh Berdiev , who claims to be the Redditor who first posted the image, stated that he took the picture from a “random X user” who had “many followers.” This tweet was in response to leaker Steve ‘OnLeaks’ Hemmerstoffer saying the image was likely an AI-generated picture. Either way, you should be very skeptical of this picture.",

The Galaxy S25 series could be among the earliest devices to be eligible for the beta. The final update may arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 early next year. After a laggard rollout of One UI 7 earlier in the year, Samsung turned the narrative in its favor with the speedy release of its One UI 8 interface . But even with One UI 8 in its initial phases, Samsung is gearing up to dish out another major update with a horde of visual and operational changes. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to arrive early next year, in line with the company’s usual launch cycle for the new Galaxy S series. However, the beta will kick off much sooner, and SamMobile indicates it could be as soon as next month.",

    "summary": "Could this mean emulation handhelds are finally ready to replace original 3DS hardware?",
    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

The message will include the hashtag #AndroidEarthquakeAlerts. Google launched an earthquake alert system for Android back in 2020, allowing users to get early warnings before the shaking begins. In 2024, the tech giant expanded the feature to cover all 50 states in the US, plus six US territories. Now, an APK teardown reveals the Mountain View firm is working on a new update that should help spread the word when an earthquake happens.
