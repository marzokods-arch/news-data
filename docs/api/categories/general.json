You can watch BigPapaPlump spend 23 minutes explaining the particulars on how the build worked, but the gist is that it involved spamming a skill that infects enemies with poison over and over until the numbers weren't numbers anymore. Damage over time skills in Diablo 4 have always gotten funky when you have a way to \"pop\" them for one massive hit.

And it's also the latest step in the Saudi Arabian Investment Fund's mission to \"sportswash\" the brutal regime, by using its influence and ubiquity across entertainment industries to distract from some of the world's most appalling human rights abuses. As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium.

    "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 won't just be the biggest game of 2026: it's the first series entry since the departure of several Rockstar big-hitters who've been involved almost from the start. Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA‚Ä¶",

Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale‚ÄîCall of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room‚Äîin which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty.

The trailer starts with a bunch of celebrities: Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett gearing up for a fight, but sadly, they don't really get too far as they're blown to bits in just a couple of seconds. This is followed by an unknown soldier asking, \"Who was that?\" as another soldier replies, \"Doesn't matter, let's move.\" I was pretty relieved when I saw these celebrities get blown up. It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground. So blowing up Zac Efron and co may seem like a bit much, but it has worked wonders in quelling ‚Ä¶",
