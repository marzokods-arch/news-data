    "body": "After a rough few years, Intel has clearly been hoping for better times, and it's fair to say that the official launch of Panther Lake at CES 2026 was a major step in the right direction. However, while all the attention was focused on the new mobile chips, the distinct lack of anything about an Arrow Lake refresh has cast doubt over whether it will actually happen or not. One hardware channel, though, is claiming that it definitely will. That's according to Golden Pig Upgrade on Weibo, as reported by Videocardz , which says that the launch of the Core Ultra 200 Plus range (the rumoured name for the Arrow Lake refresh chips) will arrive in either March or April (via machine translation). Evidence for the refresh itself comes in the form of entries in the Geekbench database. For example, this Core Ultra 9 290K Plus was uploaded only a few days ago, though it's possible that it's not genuine (i.e. it's actually a Core Ultra 9 285K result with a rejigged name). Six months ago, I readily accepted the suggestion that Intel was planning on doing an Arrow Lake refresh, if only because it's done that sort of thing many times before in the past. Core 14th Gen processors are simply regurgit…",

Our Nick reported on the issue when it first began giving Insiders an eyeful in the KB5070311 update for Windows 11. He was able to replicate the issue, which doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world when conveyed via an embedded video, but becomes practically cornea-sizzling if it happens to you while you're sitting directly in front of a 32-inch OLED monitor. Thankfully, this 'flash bang' file explorer bug should now be no more, thanks to a fix contained in the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 28020.1371 which has already begun rolling out via the Canary Channel. The update, displaying the typical art of understatement usually deployed in patch notes, describes the fix as addressing \"an issue causing File Explorer to show a white flash when navigating between pages for some Insiders after the previous flight.\" On the one hand, I'm personally not loving how often being a Windows Insider feels a bit like being an unpaid QA tester for Microsoft.

QPAD has been around for a long time, and back in the day it was somewhat of a leader in gaming peripheral tech. In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again. These products include the keyboard I'm happily typing away on right now, the Hall effect-boasting Flux 65 Model 5. I'm glad to see the company hasn't lost its knack for making quality, no-nonsense peripherals that go some …",

In fact, PC Gamer hasn’t reviewed many laptops with an RTX 5050 GPU. Creeping through the dusty stacks, marvelling at the symmetrical book stacking (just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947) and trying not to attract the attention of the librarian, I could find only one other point of reference: the Medion Erazer Scout 15 E1 . It didn’t do particularly well when put through the testing regime, which might have something to do with the Core i5 13420H and low, low price, but if you’re looking for PC gaming on a budget, it’s worth a look. The Asus TUF Gaming A16 takes the same GPU and mixes it with a much more interesting CPU. The AMD Ryzen 7 260 (from the Hawk Point generation) uses eight Zen 4 cores and can boost up to 5.1 GHz.

It proves surprisingly easy to dismantle the kitchen appliance, with the bottom separating the heating elements from your counter top secured by a single screw (conversely, the separate touch screen module is firmly held in place with a whole two screws). The cooking pot's 'smarts' are down to the Renesas R7S721031VC SoC (system on a chip), which uses a 400 MHz Cortex-A9 microprocessor. Working in concert with 128 MB of RAM and 128 MB of Flash, these modest tech specs are more than enough to play 1993's Doom at a reasonable framerate.

Supply dead. No more coming. Asus has apparently been explicit about this, stating to HUB that it has placed Asus RTX 5070 Ti cards into end-of-life (EoL) status due to the catastrophically low supply. \"This model is currently facing a supply shortage and as such they have placed the model into end-of-life status.\" Other manufacturers have been less to-the-point about it, while still noting they have pretty much zero supply of the RTX 5070 Ti. For what it's worth, this seems to be news to the Asus contacts I've spoken to, who certainly do not have a specific note about the card's EoL status from HQ in Taiwan right now. But of course, of course it's all about the memory crisis , where AI infrastructure demands have put huge strain on the supply of memory for data centres and has subsequently had a huge impact on the prices of not just DRAM, but also NAN…",

The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward. Wayland, a display protocol, has seen a handful of improvements in Wine 11, too, with \"shaped and color-keyed windows\" being supported in the experimental driver.

I asked executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini how the studio had dealt with these blows and come back seemingly swinging for the fences.

It looked great, but the initial release was limited to people willing to pay for it through the mod team's Ko-Fi page, and that seemed like the sort of thing almost guaranteed to attract unwelcome attention from Rockstar's lawyers. Sure enough, just a month after the mod launched, it's gone. \"The Bully Online project is shutting down. Thank you all for playing,\" a message posted on the website of YouTube and project lead Swegta (via Insider Gaming ) now states. The Bully Online page on Swegta's website is already gone, as is the Mod DB page, although it can still be seen through the Internet Archive . A more detailed message about the closure was posted today on Swegta's Discord server . \"The Bully Online project is shutting down forever, which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours: our official Bully Online server (on swegta.com) will be shutdown, development of scripts for Bully Online will stop, the source code will be removed from swegta.com, al…",

Giving a quick glance at some side-by-side screenshots it would be pretty easy to confuse the two, though that's not a huge surprise: Hypixel Studio, maker of Hytale, was founded by Minecraft modders and mappers who decided to create their own voxel game. Besides looks, Minecraft and Hytale have a ton in common: they both take place in \"infinite\" procedurally generated worlds with multiple biomes and deformable terrain, they both feature base-building and gear and weapon crafting, cooking, wildlife and fantasy monsters, and other similar systems. They can both be played solo or in co-op, they both have creative modes, and they're both moddable. And there's blocks. So many, many blocks. So… what's the actual difference between them? Why should you consider trying Hytale if you've already got Minecraft? 1. Hytale is very early access The biggest difference right now, frankly, is that Minecraft has been around for 15 years and Hytale just entered early access—and it's very early access.

Hypixel co-founder Noxy, who went to Riot along with the studio, said when the game was cancelled that \"after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.\" That happens sometimes, sure, but the situation took something of an awkward twist when, after some presumably fast-and-furious negotiations, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought …",

If you're thinking \"hold on a minute\" that's probably because you remember a time when Rockstar and Take Two weren't so happy about modders: Indeed the publisher accused FiveM of hosting code to \"facilitate piracy\", and banned three of the main creators from Rockstar games. This policy changed in 2022 as Rockstar eventually woke up to how massive, forward-thinking, and potentially profitable the whole modding and roleplay scene was. It then allowed non-commercial roleplay servers, as long as they didn't interfere with any official services, before moving on to just acquire Cfx.re outright. The new Cfx.re is a \"curated digital storefront\" that will offer assets, scripts and maps to players, and will host both free and paid-for content.

    "body": "Microsoft releases a list of all the bugs it knows about in Windows 11 every month, and the first of the year reveals over 100 of the pesky lil' guys in the popular operating system. Microsoft has fixed 112 vulnerabilities in its own services and has flagged a further three in non-Microsoft products. Those products are all linked to Microsoft, like the Windows Motorola Soft Modem Driver or Agere Windows Modem Driver. Usually, the addressing of vulnerabilities can go from an official fix to recommended mitigations, but 111 of those this month have an official fix, with one having a temporary fix. That sounds like a high number of vulnerabilities but it's actually a fairly large drop from this time last year, which saw 165 Microsoft vulnerabilities and 18 from non-Microsoft products. That's 115 versus 183. In December, Microsoft addressed just 65 vulnerabilities, 18 from non-Microsoft services. The majority of this month's vulnerabilities are considered less likely or unlikely to be exploited, with eight considered \"more likely\". Every vulnerability in the 'more likely' category has been given a severity score of 7.8/10. The highest severity issues are both logged at 8.8. The first …",

    "body": "You'd expect nothing less from a Minecraft-inspired crafting RPG created by prominent Minecraft modders, but Hytale already has a large collection of mods available from day one of early access. Honestly, it's hard to go wrong when picking the best Hytale mods right now, and just like the vanilla experience, it's only up from here as more are added to the game. Below, I'll go over the Hytale mods I recommend and how to download them for your own worlds. Keep in mind that Hytale is in active development, so you'll need to keep a close eye on what build you're running and likely update your mods frequently. Best Hytale mods Violet's Workshop Packs (Image credit: Hypixel) Install Violet's Furnishings , Plushies , and Wardrobe mods on CurseForge Violet's Workshop packs might just be some of my favourite Hytale mods of all. Why? Because they bring together Violet's amazing Furnishing, Wardrobe, and Plushies mods, allowing you to decorate your builds with unique and cosy furniture, or deck your character out with a fresh fit. Hytale's building tools already allow you to make some very detailed and complex structures, so why not add more decoration? Macaw's Packs (Image credit: Hypixel) …",

That'll a be a huge, 50-storey, fully-carpeted yep according to YouTuber DocJade . He decided that installing and running the construction and management simulation game, Factorio , on a hard drive, like a normal human, is far too straight forward. So, why not use 3.5-inch floppy disks. Like, over a thousand of 'em. This immediately throws up almost countless problems, starting with the circa 1.5 MB capacity of a double-sided variant of such a disk and the fact that they're not made any longer. That's before you even think about the technicalities. Factorio is a very small game by modern standards, taking up about 1 GB to 1.5 GB of storage space once installed. But that's absolutely massive if a floppy disk is your metric. Cost is an immediate problem, with 10 old-stock floppies apparently costing about $23, you're looking at about $2,500 in floppies adding in some spares. In the end, DocJade managed to source 1,250 disks from floppydisk.com for an undisclosed pr…",

Going from a yearly \"chapter\" formula to a seasonal structure where, in a recent conversation I had with executive producer Susan Kath and game director Nick Giacomini, \"nothing is off the table.\" A huge part of this shift has been in addressing long-standing quality-of-life complaints: Update 49 will begin to tackle a ton of long-standing bugbears, such as the time it takes to train mounts, after Zenimax put together a dedicated team whose job is to listen to community complaints and nip them in the bud. Or, as Kath puts it, a team with a \"mandate of: Let's find out what everybody wants to do, and let's do that.\" Some of these planned changes have been a long time coming, and while it can be easy to wonder why a team might drag their feet on such tweaks, Giacomini explains that a lot of these fixes have been a thorn in the developer's paw for a while, as well. \"We communicate with our players, we read, we listen, we play the game—it wasn't like we were blind to the things that players were …",
