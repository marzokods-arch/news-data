Leaks suggest that the 2026 flagship will be an “all-rounder” that has evolved based on current customer feedback. The rumored device is expected to arrive in Q4 2026, in line with the company’s conventional yearly release cycle. OnePlus had an interesting 2025. The company started strong with the OnePlus 13, 13R, and 13s, but then came along the OnePlus 15 and 15R , which left behind some of the highlights of their predecessors. While the new phones are only a few months old at this point, leaks have already begun to emerge for the successor to the OnePlus 15, and it appears the company could right some wrongs this year.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",

Unlike its phones, which get updated every year, Samsung maintains a longer upgrade cycle for its premium wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 3 series was released nearly 18 months ago, which means the Galaxy Buds 4 should arrive soon. Although we aren’t clear on the timeline just yet, we’ve been seeing several references to the Galaxy Buds 4 and the Buds 4 Pro in Samsung’s One UI firmware for phones. While we recently learned about changes to the earbuds’ battery capacities and new head gestures , the recently released One UI 8.5 beta 3 provides more details.

Something that hasn’t changed is the way we protect the flexible inner screens. Pre-applied screen protectors are still the norm, and while they’ve gotten better, there will come a time when you need to replace them. Manufacturers want you to bring the phone back and have a professional do the job. But when the screen protector on my Galaxy Z Fold 4 gave up the ghost, I embraced my inner Jeremy Clarkson and asked: “How hard can it be?” The problem with foldable screen protectors",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

XREAL also announced the XREAL Neo, a combination battery pack and video hub, to go with the XREAL 1S. XREAL is a big player in the burgeoning AR glasses space, and today, ahead of CES, the company’s announcing a “mid-generation refresh” for its XREAL One glasses from late 2024. The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",
