While the big game may still be months away, the excitement surrounding this announcement — made just this past Sunday (Sep. 28) — is already reaching a fever pitch. The event marks a full-circle moment for the Puerto Rican megastar, who first graced the halftime stage as a guest during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez’s iconic 2020 performance. This time, however, it’s his show — la vibra, la energía, and the cultural pride of his meteoric rise all distilled into what promises to be an unforgettable 13-minute spectacle. “I’m really excited for my friends, my family, Puerto Rico — all the Latino people around the world. I’m excited about my culture, not just for me,&#8221; Bad Bunny told hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden during their Apple Music’s&nbsp; Halftime Headliner Special .

As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone.

We don’t know all that much about the upcoming mid-ranger yet, but an image of what seemed to be its back cover leaked in July. Now, we’ve seen a handful of the wallpapers the phone might ship with — and got a possible idea of when the phone could launch. On Telegram, the Mystic Leaks channel recently shared five abstract, colorful images, apparently wallpapers for the yet-unannounced Pixel 10a. They aren’t anything too surprising, mostly curvy blobs rendered in shades of blue, red, and green that should compliment the colors the phone itself will be available in.",

Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this. But after careful consideration, I couldn’t justify paying this much on a Nest Cam and committing to a monthly subscription.

    "body": "TL;DR Google Messages has been working on a system to let you @mention other users in chats. Users who are mentioned in such a manner should see an @ symbol next to the chat. Messages may automatically suggest an @mention when you start typing someone’s name. Being able to get someone’s attention by sending them an @username just feels incredibly natural to so many of us after years and years of these kind of interactions across social media. At this point, we’re honestly just surprised to find cases where it doesn’t work, and while the list of supported platforms includes Google stuff like Chats, so far that hasn’t extended to Messages. Earlier this year, we brought you an early preview of how @mentions in Messages were coming together, and now we’ve got some progress to share.

    "summary": "Android will soon let you continue tasks from your phone on your tablet or PC, similar to Apple’s Handoff.",
    "body": "One area where iOS beats Android is its deep integration with MacBooks, which is to be expected since Apple controls both ecosystems. While tools exist to connect your Android phone to a Windows PC , these solutions often fall short of Apple’s integrations. This gap exists because Android and Windows are developed by different companies with competing interests, which complicates the creation of native, deeply integrated features. For example, Apple’s Handoff feature lets you seamlessly start a task on one device and pick it up on another. Google doesn’t currently offer a direct equivalent for Android, but mounting evidence suggests one is in the works. This new feature appears to be part of Google’s efforts to bring Android to PCs , which would enable the company to build more powerful cross-device experiences.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google devs appear to be considering implementing some changes to how Messages displays link previews. Previews could drop the full URL, and might start omitting page descriptions. Messages may start coloring its previews to match page graphics. What do you think about before clicking on a link? Are you the sort of user who scrutinizes the URL, looking for any info that may help clarify what sort of content awaits on the other end? Do you just blindly click through without thinking twice? Or have you gotten used to apps that offer a bit of a preview, summarizing where the link goes with a headline and maybe even image teaser? Today we’re looking at that kind of preview action in one particular app, as we spot some in-development changes to how Google Messages handles link sharing.
