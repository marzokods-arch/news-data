It features noticeable upgrades to the base iPhone 17, a new design for the iPhone 17 Pro, and an all-new iPhone Air that is a joy to hold . If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.

Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

It’s currently only possible to set timers using the web version of Meet. A necessary evil for organizations with distributed workforces that need to coordinate their efforts, online workplace meetings tend to eat up more time than they should. If your job involves a lot of meetings on Google Meet , good news: Google’s introduced a new feature that might help you shave a few minutes off your weekly meeting load. Google announced today that it’s rolling out a new timer feature in Google Meet that lets meeting participants add a ticking clock to the meeting interface, ideally injecting a sense of urgency into the proceedings.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Supreme Court has denied Google’s request for a stay on some provisions of the Epic Games lawsuit. This means Google must now implement several changes to the Google Play Store within 14 days. The changes include allowing developers to link to alternative download methods, use external payment systems, and set their own prices. In July 2025, Google lost an appeal against the original Epic vs Google lawsuit , which meant the company had just 14 days to make sweeping changes to the Google Play Store. Google appealed to the Supreme Court after this decision and also separately filed for a stay until its appeal is decided. Unfortunately for Google, the Supreme Court has declined the company’s request to temporarily stay parts of those sweeping changes from taking effect. The net result? Google now has 14 days once again to change several Google Play Store policies. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

As with every big Amazon Prime sale, this means you’ll find a ton of Android phones available at heavily discounted prices. While having so many Android deals sounds nice on paper, it can also make it challenging to determine which Android phones are actually worth buying and which are better left ignored. Just because you find a phone at a low price, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good buy. And that’s where I come in.",

From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",
