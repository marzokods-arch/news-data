    "body": "Hades 2 , as is Supergiant's wont with these sorts of roguelikes, had a long and extended early access period—which also means that it had a lot of patches, updates, and fiddling in its guts that might've soured players who were falling into comfy rhythms. After all, if you're getting cosy with certain boons in one run, it's easy to feel like the wax wings have been melted out from under you when a patch snatches that away. Talking to our friends over at GamesRadar , creative director Greg Kasavin seeks to soothe that particular ache: Kasavin uses the example of the Smithy Sprint, which was cut from the game during the Olympus Update . For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx.

Not because the product is incredibly complex or difficult to use; far from it, in fact. And not because it was a bug-ridden, early-release mess either. Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy? In some ways, MSI has made the challenge simple by taking a standard MEG X870E Godlike (though they're hardly what you call standard ) and upgrading the package to produce the X Edition. I mi…",

But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return. There are actually a few mods bringing Marilyn back, but I went with the straightforward Marilyn Restored for my current loadout.

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",

Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\".

    "body": "What a strange history Phoenix Point has. At the height of X-COM mania, when Firaxis was riding high on its subversive sequel to its 2012 reboot, the series' original creator Julian Gollop revealed his own spiritual successor to his massively influential game. Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best. Even Phoenix Point's developer Snapshot Games seems to agree, having just released a new patch that brings the base game closer in line to Phoenix Rising's mod. Titled the …",

Sure, they're usually full of people (or monsters) that want to kill us, but that doesn't make it any less charming to get to play in the snow without getting cold.

All you have to do is look at the screenshots of various wintery locations, and tell us which game each one is from.

Because it really is crucial, even if it did take Blizzard 21 bloody years to get with the program. MMOs are, in a lot of ways, about expression. In ye olden days of the internet, there was (and still is) a game called Second Life —this game is pretty much built on top of player-submitted stuff. Custom avatars, and, more to the point, UGC residencies that take place on a \"grid\". Crucially, the thing has straight-up 3D modelling software in it, meaning players can not only look however they'd damn well please, but they can also create spaces for themselves, too.

The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail.

    "body": "When I flew to China to play Phantom Blade Zero earlier this year, I left without one key piece of information: When it would be out. The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

    "body": "The Epic Games Store's Holiday Sale is now underway—it actually started on December 11 but we were a little busy with other things you may have heard of—and that means, aside from deals, a whole bunch of new free games to pick up. First on the block is a very big one indeed: The hit Harry Potter sim Hogwarts Legacy , which is yours for keeps if you claim it before December 18. Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

With all that adoration comes the freedom to do as you please, and for Larian that's returning from the megabucks success of Baldur's Gate 3 to play around in its very own fantasy setting. The next RPG from your new favorite developer is called, simply, Divinity. It's the studio's \"biggest most ambitious rpg yet,\" set in Rivellon of Divinity: Original Sin fame, where big red lizardmen are princes and elves gnaw on severed forearms. (Image credit: Larian) Is there a Divinity release date? There is no release date or even release year for Divinity , so don't let the AI lie to you when you ask. Can we speculate about the timeline at all? Surely we can narrow it down to something more specific than sometime in the next decade. Back in April 2025, about eight months before revealing Divinity, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the studio was \" deep in the trenches \" with its next project. Vincke also answered a question about the studio's five year plan saying that \"I hope that definitely five years from now…",

Sometimes the contents of these things can't be contained by YouTube scheduling tools or, in the case of Kravitz's villain Bawma, human-made fabrics—as Andy noted in our initial news story, Bawma's \"spectacularly chiselled abs\" are on prominent display in the trailer. And yes, they're the real deal. Earlier in the day Kravitz showed up in person to an event held by IO Interactive to spend a few minutes talking about his first videogame role and his famous workout routines . \"You look like an awesome videogame character already,\" the host said, singling out his abs. \"I try,\" said Lenny Kravitz, far more humbly than I would if I was 61 years old and in fact looked like Lenny Kravitz. Resident Evil actor Milla Jovovich, who was also on stage to promote her role as the next Hitman Elusive Target , had to get in on the abs talk, asking \"they are based on reality, right?\" \"Yes they are,\" Kravitz said. \"That's not a body double.\" It turns out that 'based on reality' is actually underselling…",

Instead of a big, exclamation-point 'one more thing!' —the prophesied return of Gabe Newell, striding onto center stage with three fingers held high—host Geoff Keighley closed the show with a reveal of a brand new game from an unknown studio: A PvP raid shooter called Highguard. Which isn't to say Highguard wasn't hyped up to infinity before the trailer dropped. After a stage-spanning flight across stormy seas and rocky shores, Keighley did what he does and put the pedal to the metal with both feet. \"Sometimes our last reveal at the Game Awards is a teaser for something years and years away. But not tonight,\" Keighley pronounced with dramatic purpose. \"Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built Apex Legends and Titanfall. Four years ago, the principals founded a new independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward with a new original game. They've done it in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development. \"The power of independent, self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing, and I think, positive theme in our industry. …",

These are the nine biggest MIA games and studios from The Game Awards 2025. Blade Copium Status : Blade is probably just getting some beauty sleep in his coffin. If you tuned in to this year's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted on December 4 (and you should have!), you may recall a devilishly handsome and well-informed games journalist explaining why Arkane's Blade adaptation is our 16th most anticipated upcoming game . We're about due for more details, even a gameplay trailer⁠—we last got official word from Arkane Lyon at the 2023 Game Awards with Blade's debut teaser. No reason to panic, though: While I was expecting a repeat TGA appearance, we might see Blade at Xbox's summer showcase, or even sooner if it does another January stream like it did this year.
