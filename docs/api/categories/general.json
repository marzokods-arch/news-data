To win you'll have to build up a base of resources to keep a collection of valiant heroes fed and armed. Each time you build up a new kingdom you'll kick off with a choice of hero, like knight or priestess, as the core of your autobattling army. During the first days you'll build up a base of resources, like stone and wood, before using them to expand your production chains into the big stuff: meals. Every hero has a favorite meal to eat that lets them level up faster, a key to staying ahead of ever-escalating enemy forces. We first got a good look at Super Fantasy Kingdom a while back , and really got intrigued during the December 2024 PC Gaming show, when we saw the undead faction . The roguelike bits between waves are some of the most entertaining parts: As you explore the world beyond your little kingdom you unlock new heroes to recruit, 50-some in total, as well as small static bonuses and new buildings to diversify your economy.

You can load up modder Vriska's latest work in the Duskworld multiplayer mode if you'd like, but it was primarily designed for the game's wave survival mode. I tried out a few rounds for myself, and it's great. Dusk Gulch is a much smaller, more intimate affair than Blood Gulch, and I did some wiki research to make sure that wasn't just my middle school memories playing tricks on me. The scale makes sense for its intended purpose, and it even has fun-size versions of distinct map features like the high path on one side of the canyon, and the protected cave route on the other. The bases themselves are small fortifications with a jump pad in the center, and usually see weapon and ammo spawns depending on what wave you've reached. It's frantic, claustrophobic, and fun. Plus, it had been a minute since I'd actually loaded up Dusk at all, and I'd forgotten just how good it is. Dusk has proudly joined its inspirations, Half-Life and Quake, in the ranks of …",

These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely.

You'll certainly have less of it by the time you're done reading this review, and less still if you decide to pick up Hyperbeat: a rhythm game that roped me in with its oddball UI, low-poly dreamscapes, and atmospheric central hub full of NPCs eager to introspect with you. It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter). Every step you take in the hub world—a liminal space-and-bar called the Wellspri…",

That testing phase is rapidly approaching its end, however, as PP has announced its survival roguelike will arrive in early access on November 20. For the uninitiated, Prologue: Go Wayback is a deceptively simple game about hiking from a cabin in the woods to a distant weather tower, where each run is completely unique thanks to maps generated by the studio's homebrewed machine-learning technology. Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art. I remain sceptical about the functional benefits the ML tech brings, but it's a more nuanced use-case than a studio trying to replace human workers with ChatGPT or whatever. As for the game …",

Thank you for all of the thoughtful feedback.\" The initial change was done as a bit of an experiment. The devs wanted to see if switching the structure up could solve complaints from players that, past round five, matches would snowball with powers and items becoming too strong for players to handle.

Few properly achieve that, happy to focus on just one area while abstracting away others. But the grand strategy genre is always about expanding the view, incorporating into its wargame roots systems of politics, economics and culture. Europa Universalis 5 widens the frame again, adding a new wrinkle: People. It's nothing less than an attempt at simulating the world for centuries with a fidelity beyond anything else in the genre. You play as the controlling force behind a country over 500 years of history, 1337 to 1836, using the same mechanical simulation to present both the late medieval and the entirety of the early modern period.

It did not seem positive. \"Oh, what the fuck,\" said O'Flaherty. \"No. This did not need to happen. Sorry whoever was involved in this. Oh man, yeah, no.\" So not exactly a thumbs-up, there. Still, O'Flaherty does—sort of—get a bit more positive. \"If you’re gonna do it, yeah, alright, why not? Why am I judging?\" Which is less approval so much as it is resignation to the whims of fate. I can't fault the guy. Deus Ex was never a graphical powerhouse, but it had a vibe and a cohesive aesthetic all the way back in the year 2000. \"You wanted to lean into what the engine did well and don’t do the shit that it doesn’t do well,\" said O'Flaherty. The remaster, as we've seen it so far, trades all that in for a slapdash up-rezzing of everything, making the game too bright, too bulky, and strangely even more archaic-looking than it did originally.

A lot of that arises from your freedom to make a mess of things: Your in-game avatar isn't the most hard-charging videogame hero imaginable, and there are many ways to die, most of them awful. The game itself is also surprisingly gross for an isometric point-and-clicker. (Which I mean as a compliment.) So it's a good time!

One YouTuber, Macho Nacho Productions (via Hackaday ), is such a big fan of this aesthetic that they've decided to build their own version, complete with a custom-milled aluminium chassis and the original Xbox internals, albeit with some light upgrades to bring it slightly more into the modern age.. To try and get an understanding of the specific size of the prototype Xbox, Macho Nacho found an image with a Microsoft Sidewinder game pad next to it that was captured at some point in the early 2000s. After comparing a 3D rendering of the two side by side, they then decided that it wasn't quite accurate enough. Macho Nacho took a trip out to New York to see a prototype in a display case, where they took pictures of that case from many angles and sent them to a 3D modeller, where they then created a Gaussian Splat. Effectively, this method grabs as many pictures as possi…",

What am I saying, of course you've done that. We've all been there. Moving on. Anyway, turns out there's a future in which something similar could be possible. Earlier this month, Yokohama City University's Minds1020Lab began trialling \"anime therapy\", as reported by itmedia (thanks, Automaton , for the translation). Here's how it works: Participants will choose one of six anime avatars, each with their unique backstory. Then, in what looks to be a visual-novel style interface, a psychologist will take on the role of said anime character and conduct a counselling session. Some questionnaire-based psychological evaluation happens before and after these sessions, too. Something interesting that's implied here, per Automaton, is the fact that a large chunk of these sessions will also be devoted to learning about these anime characters and their place in the fictional world that Minds1020Lab has set up, here. And listen, it might be easy to see the…",

Since then we've been waiting to see where his performance would land on a scale from total trainwreck to \"okay, I guess,\" which really felt like the best we could hope for from a major recast four seasons deep. Credit to Hemsworth, his performance is indeed: Fine. As if by design, the season's writing stuffs Geralt behind the rest of his adventuring party where he can't commit the sin of being memorable, even for being great, however unlikely that would have been. The Witcher season 4 begins with a set of flashbacks recapping the series so far, sliding Hemsworth into retellings of old scenes as if he'd been there all along. It's a weird first gambit—Netflix attempting to swap the dead goldfish on us even though we've known this was coming for years. It was initially a bit uncanny as I kept trying to peer through the white wig, yellow eyes, grizzled stubble, and superhero silhouette to remember that yeah, that sure is a similar but different buff Hollywood guy.

The point is, there are too many for any normal person to commit to reading. Fortunately, you don't have to. That number includes a lot of extremely skippable short story anthologies, and multiple novels so tangential you won't miss anything if you don't read them. If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change. If you'd like to spend years of your life reading books where that hope is snuffed out like a candle by a galaxy of darkness, that's …",
