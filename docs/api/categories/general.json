    "summary": "In this week’s The Contenders, Sabrina Carpenter’s new album should launch another big single near the top of the Hot 100 — and return its first one around there.",
    "body": "The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Sept. 13, we look at Sabrina Carpenter’s first two singles from her just-released Man’s Best Friend set, and which may have the stronger performance on next week’s chart. &nbsp; Sabrina Carpenter, “Tears” &amp; “Manchild” (Island/Republic) : Pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is all but guaranteed to have the top spot on next week’s Billboard 200 albums chart with her new set Man’s Best Friend . The follow-up to last year’s four-week Billboard 200 No. 1 Short n’ Sweet , Carpenter’s latest arrives on the back of a good deal of discourse around its provocative title and cover — which the singer-songwriter has largely shrugged off — as well as her second No. 1 on the Hot 100 with lead single “Manchild,” which became her first song to debut atop the chart upon its June release. Next week, Carpenter will look to make it two No. 1 debuts in a row with winking, discofied second single “Tears” — which, as “Manchild&#8221; did, arrives along with a big new music video.

    "summary": "Beth Stelling's take on landlord hell, Jim Jefferies' exploration of marriage, and a posthumous showcase of Ken Flores' standup comedy are among September's top streaming offers.",
    "body": "There’s range in this month&#8217;s best comedy specials: from half an hour (or less) to 60 minutes (or more); from young (Ralph Barbosa turns 29 in October) to . . . well, not old, but middle-aged (Jim Jefferies is 48); and from North to South America (Australia is in the mix as well, since Jefferies is from Sydney). In his native Chile, Fabrizio Copano hosts his own late-night show; I’m From the Future is his first English-language special and includes the story of how he fell in love with a woman from Texas in Mexico City and ended up driving a U-Haul full of furniture (and a Mexican dog) across the border to New York City. Beth Stelling lives on the other side of the country, in Los Angeles, and&nbsp; The Landlord Special &nbsp;will put whatever housing woes you have in perspective. Barbosa (single) and Jefferies (married with kids) both have insights to share on matters of the heart, with&nbsp;Jefferies digging in not just on his marriage and that of his parents, but the whole institution: &#8220;My mother never lived long enough to see my father happy—she missed out on it by a couple of days.”&nbsp;As for Ken Flores, his must-see half-hour&nbsp;— part of the LOL!

    "body": "Image Credit: HeroX The next era of lunar exploration demands a new kind of wheel &#8211; one that can sprint across razor-sharp regolith, shrug off extremely cold nights, and keep a rover rolling day after lunar day. The Rock and Roll with NASA Challenge seeks that breakthrough. If you can imagine a lightweight, compliant wheel that stays tough at higher speeds while carrying lots of&nbsp; cargo, your ideas could set the pace for surface missions to follow. For this phased Challenge, Phase 1 rewards the best concepts and analyses, Phase 2 funds prototypes, and Phase 3 puts the best wheels through a live obstacle course simulating the lunar terrain. Along the way, you’ll receive feedback from NASA mobility engineers and the chance to see your hardware pushed to its limits.&nbsp; In Phase 3, to prove concepts, NASA is using MicroChariot, a nimble, 45 kg test rover that will test the best designs from Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 at the Johnson Space Center Rockyard in Houston, Texas. Whether you’re a student team, a garage inventor, or a seasoned aerospace firm, this is your opportunity to rewrite the playbook of planetary mobility and leave tread marks on the future of exploration.
