According to a Phone 3 user, Nothing support confirmed the update was pulled to implement an urgent fix. The company hasn’t officially announced the halt yet, and the rollout is expected to resume once internal testing is complete. Nothing released its Android 16–based Nothing OS 4.0 update for the Phone 3 on November 21. This was followed by a rollout to other models, including the Nothing Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro, on November 28. However, it now appears that the company has mysteriously paused the update.",

Called “smartphone pinky,” it describes discomfort and pain that result from holding and handling one’s smartphone, especially when using the little finger as a platform to seat the device. As I’ve learned the hard way, it’s a terrible way to hold a phone. I regularly experience pain in my hand after using my device, but in my opinion, it’s the most natural grip when using a phone one-handed. Notably, it appears that a host of readers agree with me.",

With the Pixel 10 series shipping out of the box with built-in Qi2 and Qi2 25W , we thought things would finally be standardized and that we wouldn’t have to think about which charger we’re using with which phone. Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers. The takeaway? It’s easy to buy the wrong charger for your phone and, as our surveys have revealed, many of you have fallen for that trap. Here’s what I found out and why that’s wrong.",

Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well.

In practice, it not only lived up to its specs but also naturally slipped into everyday use.",

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

Pricing and availability haven’t been announced. For the past few years, Motorola’s been teaming up with Pantone, whose proprietary color matching system has become a widely used standard, to make an annual phone featuring the company’s Color of the Year. Moto announced the latest in that series today — and it’s surprisingly dull. Pantone’s 2026 Color of the Year is called Cloud Dancer (number 11-4201 in Pantone’s system), a light gray. On its own, Cloud Dancer looks like plain white, but it does have some contrast against a true paper white. Moto’s made a special edition of its Edge 70 featuring a Cloud Dancer-colored finish and crystals from jewelry maker Swarovski .",

Reports span several models, but others say theirs still works, so the issue isn’t universal. Google hasn’t documented any changes to One-Handed Mode; we’ve reached out to the company for comment. A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",
