    "body": "Battlefield 6 's Portal mode, which allows players to run their own servers with custom rules and edited maps, will eventually allow us to construct our own maps from a 'blank slate' template. Portal was the best feature in Battlefield 2042, allowing players to set up pseudo-dedicated servers with their own special rules and map rotations. It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools . Speaking to the Portal development team recently, PC Gamer's Morgan Park asked whether we could go so far as to delete all of the buildings in a map to transform it into a flat wasteland. Not right now, says principal game designer Greg Black. \"Currently spatial editing is entirely additive,\" Black told PC Gamer. \"Players won't be able to modify the existing asset instances in a map, but will be able to add new instances and build …",

Living up to its history, the Wombo Combo in Borderlands 4 shoots two barrels at once: One is your standard assault rifle, while the other is a grenade launcher. Saying the Wombo Combo hits like a truck is an understatement, making it one of the best guns for both mobbing and bosses, even without the bonkers splash damage Rafa build . Such power surely comes with a catch, and you're right, it does: it's very easy to blow yourself up with it if you're not careful. Here's what you need to do to get the Wombo Combo.

Arriving at the school with Shu and Rinko, you go to the back gate, which leads to a mountain pass—your supposed escape route from the horror that is encroaching on Ebisugaoka—only to find that it's locked. Instead of hopping over this shoulder-high obstacle, which is what I would've done, Hinako and her friends opt to enter the school in search of the key. While Shu and Rinko rest in one of the classrooms, you get voluntold to head out into the school and search for the key so you can escape into the mountains and hopefully outrun all the red spider lilies.

But apparently somewhere along the way someone with money to burn decided it's a franchise, and publisher GungHo has just announced we're getting a new sequel in just a few months: Let It Die: Inferno. The original is one of those unique oddities of gaming. On paper it's a sort of roguelike with soulslike-style action combat in an urban horror world. But really that doesn't even begin to describe it. It isn't that fun to play, it runs like crap, and half its systems make no sense—but oh boy, it has personality. The first character you meet in the game is a skateboarding grim reaper called Uncle Death. Your stable of fighters is a meat locker full of reanimated cadavers that you can slap stickers on to give them skills. You catch and eat frogs to heal. Between runs, you hand in completed quests to the most perfectly disinterested teenage girl in media history . You should give it a go if you never tried it at the time.

And there's no avoiding this riddle, unfortunately, as you need to solve it to continue through the Shrine Path and chase after the mysterious Fox Mask.

With the launch of the new 500+ , Raspberry is hoping to attract even more computing hobbyists to the fray, though what one modder has managed to achieve already suggests that its appeal could be even bigger than expected. The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

Gustav Nisser, Starbreeze's head of commercial, said there was no connection—that the timing was simply \"unfortunate,\" and the studio had \"dropped the ball\" on keeping fans in the loop.

However, cut to three years later and the project hasn't come to fruition. In fact, the entire brand of Fluffnest is slowly disappearing from the internet.

The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low.

I have thoroughly and completely judged a book by its cover. Despite having all the hallmarks of a Zenless Zone Zero, or a Genshin Impact—that is to say, being a free-to-play RPG with cute anime girls in it—Ananta won't actually be a character-based Gacha game. That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

So I ought to be thrilled that a proper remaster of the original Deus Ex —immersive sim granddaddy, bonafide all-timer—broke cover at yesterday's State of Play. I am not thrilled, and nor is anyone else, so far as I can see.

I'll admit, I don't really see the appeal of simulating an activity one could also readily engage in—so imagine my confusion when I heard about Deutschland's remote robotaxis. In the now-defunct Tegel airport in Berlin, drivers take to impressive driving simulator rigs to remotely control cars up and down the runway (via The Guardian ). Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that. Besides monitoring car movement on a generously sized triple monitor setup, the remote drivers also enjoy the plush cups of what appears to be the Logitech G430 wired headset.

Your goal is simple: read the clue and try to figure out how it relates to one of the other scarecrows that are standing before them. Picking the wrong one can be fatal, as these scarecrows will come to life and attack you, meaning you'll potentially waste your health and your weapon's integrity.

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand.

Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above. What exactly Rockstar's support means is left ambiguous, but having nopixel V running through the Rockstar launcher feels huge.
