No going around introducing myself to every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the island. There's just a bit of hand-holding with some introductory quests, and the encouragement to go and become certified in a number of professions.

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds.

It suggested a version of TF2 without the proliferation of cosmetics, a return to the readable silhouettes and basic weapons of its early days, and while it is that it's also a reimagining of TF2 that adds cut content and abandoned ideas from its early development. There's an escort mode with a playable civilian class, four-team modes, jump pads, new weapons like the nail gun, dynamite pack, and tranquilizer gun, and more. But that's not the reason for its renaming. As the modders explained , \"Valve requested a few months ago that we rename our mod, because the name Team Fortress 2 Classic was too similar to their Team Fortress Classic.\" \"We've learned that various other mods have recently used the word 'classic' in ways that unintentionally made them look like official Valve products, and as a result, Valve had a new policy put in place back in September.\" Choosing a new name was \"surprisingly difficult\" both because they wanted a name that meant they could retain the TF2C abbreviation, and \"it quickly became apparent that few options actually embodied what we set out to do better than 'classic' had. …",

Notably, Stray's developer, BlueTwelve, and publisher, Annapurna, are mostly in the background of this story. As reported by Gematsu back in 2022, Skybound and iam8bit handled distribution of physical PS5 copies of the game, with iam8bit offering a special edition, as well as a vinyl record of the game's soundtrack. According to the suit, which is seeking over $4 million in damages, \"Skybound failed to provide the monthly reports as agreed,\" referring to financial records related to the partnership. \"It also padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items.\" With regards to Stray, iam8bit alleges that Skybound used insider information⁠—including confidential details of iam8bit's royalty split with Annapurna⁠—to cut the smaller company out of a distribution deal for the subsequent Nintendo Switch physical edition of Stray.

And what better fodder for my super chill, super relaxing playlist than videogame music? After all, its entire purpose is to create ambience. It's vibes personified. Instead of telling you how it's feeling, it's trying to tell you how you should feel. Ooh, don't you feel so fuzzy and nostalgic as I play the flute in this quaint woodland village?

The result is one of the best strategy games of the last decade. \"While the inspiration is clear, it would be a disservice to imply that it's mainly trading in nostalgia,\" Fraser Brown wrote in his Northgard review , awarding it a score of 84%. \"This Viking saga builds on the history-themed RTS romps of the '90s, but it's not beholden to them.\" Northgard went on to sell over 5 million copies and receive a bunch of expansions and DLC. Now, developer Shiro Games has bundled several of these additional adventures with the base game to form Northgard: Definitive Edition , which throws in a few new features for good measure.

The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).
