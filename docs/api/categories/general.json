As results rolled in throughout the annual broadcast on Saturday (Jan. 25), the Adelaide hip-hop trio’s latest entries pushed them ahead of Eilish on the tally, marking another milestone in the group’s enduring relationship with Australia’s most influential listener-voted chart. Hilltop Hoods have been fixtures of the Hottest 100 since the early 2000s, with songs spanning multiple eras of their career consistently finding favour with triple j voters. Their sustained presence across decades places them among a small group of Australian acts to repeatedly chart in the countdown, reflecting both their crossover appeal and deep-rooted connection to local audiences. Eilish, by contrast, has built her Hottest 100 footprint in a far shorter time frame, racking up entries since her breakout years and becoming one of the most successful international artists in the poll’s recent history. Her run has been emblematic of triple j’s increasingly global scope, particularly as streaming-driven pop and alternative releases have come to dominate recent countdowns. The moment al…",
