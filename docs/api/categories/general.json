It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well.

It is unclear if this feature relies on the cloud or on-device processing for these summaries. Samsung’s next One UI release was long expected to be a significant update, but the leaked One UI 8.5 changelog provided a clearer sense of its magnitude. While the leaked changelog serves as a good baseline, we’ve now spotted code for new features in the leaked One UI 8.5 firmware that aren’t included in this changelog. In future One UI builds, the My Files app will soon receive a file summary feature to help you open the right file.

With improved app icon customization, lock screen widgets , and more, QPR2 is a darn good update. One of the more interesting changes is actually a reversal of something added in Android 16 QPR1 this past September. As part of the Material 3 Expressive interface added to Pixel phones with that update, one of the bigger UI tweaks was a blur effect in the app drawer and Quick Settings panel. I don’t mind it, but it’s something a lot of Pixel users have wanted Google to get rid of.",

So, I did what any well-informed shopper would do: I sought out the advice of experts. I pinged a few members of the SoundGuys crew and checked in with our own Rita El Khoury, whose gadget tastes often match my own. I gave them my budget, which wasn’t much considering I was coming from the CMF Buds Pro 2 , and asked what they thought I should get next.",

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

The rest of the hardware remains unchanged, including the 7-inch Kaleido 3 display, stylus support, and page turn buttons. The boosted battery helps reduce one of color e-ink’s biggest trade-offs. Kobo shoppers may be in for a meaningful upgrade if there’s a Libra Colour in their carts. The company just quietly gave the already-popular device a larger 2,300mAh battery. The change, reported earlier this week by Good e-Reader, brings a welcome boost to endurance and should translate to nearly an extra week of reading time. It’s a small tweak on paper, but for anyone who’s eyed color e-ink with skepticism over battery drain, it could improve the day-to-day experience.

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X.
