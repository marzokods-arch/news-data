To ease the sting of delaying just a few weeks ahead of its intended launch, the Paralives team did show off 45 minutes of new, uncut gameplay this week. And you know what? It convinced me that Paralives is going to avoid the biggest flaw in Inzoi's early access: a lifeless Live Mode. The whole 45 minutes of new gameplay takes place with a single playable \"para\" in his small flat and the shopping square below it. That may sound like a red flag for the state of the game, but I was way less worried about seeing the breadth of the Paralives neighborhood and more interested in the depth of its simulation. Some things that piqued my interest: The daily local newspaper that gives some in-world ideas for activities you should pursue Really prominent skill progress bars and skill level up notifications Conversation system that encourages you to choose between options, not spam the same interaction Personality trait upgrades that give gameplay buffs like playing music to remove sad emotions Contextual moods like being embar…",

This new era for the MMO will begin when Midnight launches on March 2. Blizzard dropped the release date today, which is also a deadline for the beta that's currently running. Reactions have been mixed on how the developers are simplifying the many classes of WoW to work without needing mods, or addons, to tell you what to do. Game director Ion Hazzikostas made his case for why these changes needed to happen now and promised to be listening carefully to players as the beta continues. Everything else seems to be going pretty smoothly—well, except the fish that ate everyone's frame rate. Every day I see people coming up with new and clever ways to make skylights and libraries with player housing. And, while it's not all positive, discussion around the story now that Azeroth has been invaded by towering void monsters seems to have everyone curious about how it'll play out. Next month, Blizzard will be opening the gates to player housing early for anyone who h…",

Thanks to Vendetta's hero trial , you can put her kit to the test almost two weeks early. Vendetta, also known as La Lupa, is one of the most distinctive heroes we've seen in Overwatch, and that's primarily because she's the first true melee character. \"But what about Doomfist or Brigitte?\", I hear you say. While these two are technically melee, they're not really when you think about it. Vendetta is almost entirely a sword-slinging brawler with a primary attack that can combo, and that's what makes her different. So when can you play her? Overwatch 2 Vendetta hero trial release time Vendetta's hero trial begins on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT to Monday, December 1 , at the same times, which coincides with the usual update time for the game. With the shop reset yesterday, this update only includes Vendetta's playtest. Once the trial wraps up, Vendetta will officially release in Season 20, which launches on Tuesday, December 9.

You know, the best CPU for gaming you can buy. That processor. Probably not, but I will say a few things that you need to be aware of if you're new to the whole CPU upgrade thing. First of all, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D will only work in an AM5 socket motherboard. If you're not sure what socket your current motherboard has, then download CPU-Z (it's completely free) and look for the package details in the CPU tab. We're curating the best deals this Black Friday on PC gaming products . If it says anything other than Socket AM5 (LGA 1718) , then you'll need to buy a new AM5 motherboard .

Requiem is a new continuation of the mainline story, meaning you don't need any prior knowledge of Resi to make sense of the unfolding narrative. With a new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, who will explore places of interest in the Resi universe, including a destroyed Raccoon City. But some prior knowledge will help sniff out easter eggs and get a good grasp of how the story will likely unfold. (Image credit: Capcom) To this end, two Resi games will be the most helpful to play. Resident Evil 7 is the first that comes to mind, as this was also directed by Nakanishi and follows a similar structure of introducing a new protagonist who is unfamiliar with combat to the world of Resident Evil. Then there's Resident Evil 2. Nakanishi has explained how Requiem will fall closer to RE2 as opposed to Resident Evil 4 . RE4 is considered to fall on the more action-focused side of the series, while RE2 is thought …",

According to the Geekbench entry , we're talking 2,849 single-core points and 15,434 multi-core points. Arguably, it's the single-core result that's most interesting as it theoretically allows for a direct comparison between different generations of Intel Performance cores. The multi-core comparison is complicated by the vagaries of difference Performance, Efficient and Low Power Efficient core configurations, albeit the total result is, ultimately, the total result. The specific Panther Lake model appearing in the Geekbench results is the Core Ultra 9 386H, a mobile CPU as all Panther Lake chips will be at launch. It shows up as a 16-core model on Geekbench and is expected to have four Performance, eight Efficient, and four Low Power Efficient cores. The closest existing Intel CPU for comparison is the Core Ultra 9 285H, which is a similarly configured 16-core mobile chip, albeit with six Performance and two Low Power Efficient cores.

It might be just what you need, too—especially now that Reforged has its own private multiplayer servers, the headline feature of its recent 2.0 update . Even more ambitiously than the popular Seamless Co-op mod (which is also fully supported here), Reforged bypasses the original game's anti-cheat systems while retaining bloodstains, phantoms, summons and invasions. Helpful, as there are more than 1,200 collectible stat-boosting rune fragments hidden throughout the entire game like Crackdown's irresistible agility orbs, many of which you'd never find without other kindly players placing glowing, tongue-in-cheek hints.

    "summary": "Moonlighter 2 combines the ideas of several games into one, though it doesn't yet excel at any one element.",
    "body": "When Moonlighter released in 2018, it was to a fairly positive critical reception. Players seemed to enjoy the combination of cozy shop simulator and dungeon crawling roguelite, inspired by the Rogue Legacies and Stardew Valleys of the time. Some grumbled about a lack of depth and incentive to keep returning to the dungeon again and again, and seven years later developer Digital Sun is ready to show us what it’s learned from those criticisms. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault is now available in early access on Steam. I spent several hours with it over the past week, and it already feels like a more focused and refined version of the original. The premise remains unchanged: you play as Will, a shopkeep-slash-dungeoneer who is looking to turn his spoils into cold hard cash. The core loop involves diving into randomized dungeons, fighting the monsters there, filling your backpack with loot, selling it for a tidy profit, and doing it all again. Inventory management itself is a puzzle, as items interact with each other in your backpack, forcing you to think carefully about how you use the limited space. In essence, it’s three games in one, each section complete with its own rules. Whil…",

It’s the owner of Monopoly Go creators Savvy Games Group, has stakes in Nintendo, Embracer Group, Capcom, and Take-Two, among many others,and most recently was involved in the $55 billion joint acquisition of Electronic Arts . But all that spending may be catching up with the PIF, as a new report suggests that it is running low on cash for further investments. According to the New York Times (via GamesIndustry ) the PIF is restricting operations under the eye of Crown Prince Mohammed, as numerous projects it has invested in are under \"financial distress\". It's worth noting that none of these distressed investments are directly related to gaming. Troubled projects include Saudi Arabia's ambitious (some may say preposterous) city construction project Neom , with its plans for a 105 mile, glass-walled city called \"The Line\" being massively scaled back . Other struggling investments cited by the NYT include a coffee chain with just one shop, a cruise line with one lonely ship, and \"an electric vehicle start-up begun three years ago that has yet to deliver a car.\" The …",

You can find Thomas in everything from Hogwarts Legacy to Elden Ring , but it all began with a 2013 Skyrim mod that replaced all dragons with the resplendent blue engine, as well as adding sound effects from the show. That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player. The reason that you can now get got by countless flying Thomases? Take it away Trainwiz: \"I am incapable of learning lessons whenever it involves corporations, because I fundamentally do not view toy company CEOs or media CEOs as people.\" Expanding on this thought on t…",

Quantic Dream is opening Spellcasters Chronicles up to the public in a couple of weeks, on December 4 at 3 pm UTC until December 8 at 9 am UTC. Over these few days, players across Europe and North America will be able to jump into games and check this new game out for themselves. (Image credit: Quantic Dream) There are six spellcasters for you to try out: Two Duelists ( the Swamp Witch and the Astral Monk), two Conquerers (the Iron Sorcerer and Fire Elementalist), and two Enchanters (the Mystic Scribe and Stone Shaman). Each one will have a variety of decks, expendable summons, and abilities. Everyone also has an ultimate that builds up throughout the match and access to summoning a titan, a huge beast the size of a skyscraper that can destroy almost anything in its path. \"We built Spellcasters Chronicles as a game that thrives on adaptation, creativity, and team synergy, and that only truly …",

Shortly after tanking Fallout 4's \"very positive\" review average on Steam, Bethesda said it was investigating reports of new bugs, performance issues, and crashes introduced with the Creations Menu Update that went out alongside the Anniversary Edition . The studio issued a hotfix on November 17 for its biggest troublemaker, Fallout 4's Creations Menu, and shared plans for more on November 24, followed by another update sometime in December. Bethesda made good on some performance fixes last Friday, on November 21, when it published a follow up Steam blog with patch notes to address stability and crash issues.

Quantic Dream's new MOBA Spellcasters Chronicles did have the leg up in that I had to play it to write this.

(Image credit: Quantic Dream) Instead of going for a top-down approach, Spellcasters Chronicles opts for third-person. Taking control of a spellcaster, I started with a limited number of summonable grunts and abilities, both things I'd build into as time went on and I levelled up during the match. Every character can also sprint along the ground or fly in the sky for an unlimited amount of time, making it easy to get a good grasp of the battlefield. Matches are 3v3, but each player has the option to summon an increasing number of grunts depending on what perks you pick every time you level up. Games als…",
