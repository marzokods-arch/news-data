    "body": "TL;DR Google Play System updates deliver crucial features to Android devices, but uninstalling problematic ones has been tricky. Google has offered a rollback tool, but that requires connecting to a computer over the Android Debug Bridge. Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble. And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.

We have verified these claims, with intermittent charging, random stops, and extremely slow speeds. I also tested a bunch of 7.5W, 10W, 15W, and newer Qi and Qi2 chargers with the Pixel 9 and 10 series to find out which ones are the most problematic. With the Google Pixel 10 series , Google went all in on Qi2 wireless charging , embedding a MagSafe-like Pixelsnap magnetic connection. All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging. This upgrade sounds great on paper, but it has left users of older Qi chargers scratching their heads in confusion and frustration, and I’m one of them. As it turns out, Pixel 10 users have been complaining that their phones are not charging properly with chargers that aren’t Qi2 or Qi2 25W-certified.

Along the way, it collected 10 weeks at No. 1 in the U.K., where it was confirmed as the biggest selling U.K album for both 2019 and 2020, and yielded “Someone You Loved,” a No. 1 smash on both sides of the Atlantic, and around the globe.

Samsung’s revised plan appears to retain the previous dimensions of the S26, with a smaller increase in battery capacity, while focusing on maintaining competitive pricing. Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup. A new report now sheds light on the reason behind some of these changes, and the answer is surprisingly simple: Apple. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This year, Samsung released its first ultra-thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. The tech giant originally planned to follow it up with a sequel, but ultimately ended up canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge due to poor sales. As it turns out, the compromises required to shrink the phone down were not worth the squeeze.

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2.

ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

The launch of the OnePlus 13 is still fresh in my mind. But OnePlus, backed by the earlier-than-usual release of the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 , is already launching a successor: the OnePlus 15. Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship. As it finds a spot among other flagships, it’s worth evaluating how the OnePlus 15 competes against its competitors in the premium segment.",

This time, though, instead of creating a jack of all trades (which, to be fair, was a master of most of them), OnePlus is after power users — or at least, I think it is. The reason I say I think rather than I know is that despite testing this phone for a few weeks, I’m not quite sure how we got to this point. I know the OnePlus 15 is powerful on paper — it boasts the latest chipset, a large battery, ample RAM, and sufficient storage to prove it. But for everything that has improved, it feels like just as much has taken a step backward from a predecessor that is still one of the best Android phones you can buy .

The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Frequent changes to product plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge and Galaxy S26 Plus have delayed Samsung’s design and production timeline.

We first heard that the Galaxy S26 launch is reportedly set for February 2026 in San Francisco. A subsequent leak disagreed with this timeline, stating that the company had managed to pull itself together and is now gunning for a late January launch .
