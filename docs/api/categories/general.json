Although this will still be an early access, I can’t wait to get my proverbial hands on it because I’m sick of Google Assistant’s glitches . The inconsistency, frequent bugs, and silly downgrades have taken the joy out of using a “smart” speaker, to a point where I find myself arguing with it more often than using it. Gemini, however, has been a lot more interesting to use on my Pixel phones and watches, and I can’t help but think that this will be a huge upgrade for everyone. Here’s why.",

The 23-track set follows in the organic-sounding, warm-feeling alt-R&amp;B mode of the first Swag , with many of the same sonic architects (Dijon, Carter Lang, Mk.gee), and even a couple overlapping feature guests in Lil B and Eddie Benjamin. New to the Swag is Afrobeats star Tems, British singer-songwriter Bakar and &#8217;00s Louisiana rapper Hurricane Chris.

On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo.
