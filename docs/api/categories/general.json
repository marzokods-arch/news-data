But maybe there is. \"I would love to [make Stardew Valley 2] because it would just be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012, when I started working with Stardew Valley,\" Barone said in a wide-ranging interview with IGN . \"There's something fun about the number of possibilities in a whole new world, which I think would be fun for me. It'd be fun for my team. We'd be really excited about it.\" Barone said one concern he has about a potential sequel is that Stardew Valley fans are really attached to Pelican Town and its villagers: \"I do fear a little bit that if it's a whole new cast of characters, people might feel put off by that.\" Another possible approach would be to use the same cast in a new adventure, he continued, although that approach would leave him \"stuck with the same thin…",

One of Nesmith's themes is how Bethesda tweaks its games for mass appeal, even when this involves dialling back the complexity of certain systems. But when it comes to the studio's future titles (Nesmith no longer works at Bethesda), he thinks one recent example in particular has shown a way forward. \"I would probably look at two things [to shake up],\" says Nesmith. \"I would probably look at having the world be more dynamic. \"Bethesda games in the last decade have become less dynamic in order to meet the needs of what the games needed and audience expectations, but to be able to have the world be more fluid, I think that would be very cool.\" The example Nesmith cites is Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, which received a whopping 97% from PC Gamer's Fraser Brown and scooped our 2023 game of the year award .

Fortunately for the cape-wearing commandos gleefully detonating ordnance across the galaxy, my input has no bearing on the matter, and today has brought us yet another exciting addition to the armories of managed democracy. Helldivers 2 has a tank now. Described in the patch notes for today's 6.0.1 update as offering \"unrivaled firepower and defense on the battlefield,\" the TD-220 Bastion Mk XVI battle tank is a new stratagem that will deploy a drivable, heavily armored battle tank equipped with a 120mm high-velocity cannon and a heavy coaxial machinegun. It is also big and can run over things—things like bugs. And robots. And, probably, other Helldivers. To unlock the Bastion, you'll need 35,000 requisition slips—which is, tragically, more than I found in my pockets when logging into Helldivers 2 today after months away—and if the mechs were any indication, you'll likely need to be at least rank 25. Once you've spent the necessary military scrip, you're free to deploy your very own tank…",

But Highguard's marquee Raid mode is genuinely unlike any other FPS mode out there, at least in the sense that nobody has ever constructed this particular FPS sandwich before: Two slices of Rainbow Six with a battle royale center. I also appreciate that it's a free-to-play shooter that doesn't bombard players with ads (at least for now) or sell battle passes that expire.

That's a tricky thing to navigate when determining value here, as nothing is as good value as it was five months ago, but I have generally little bad to say about the Element Pro. It's solid. Starting with its choice of components, it comes with an Asus Prime RX 9070 XT 16 GB, which isn't far off the choice of graphics card I'd choose for a PC build of my own right now. It's capable at 4K and has 16 GB of VRAM. That alone is sure to make some gamers swoon. Though you don't get to switch on DLSS, FSR is a decent alternative. And the Prime card, including a triple-fan shroud, is pretty cool and quiet—reaching a mere 61 °C in my testing in Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition. The CPU is the tremendous Ryzen 7 7800X3D , which was once upon a time the best CPU for gaming . That title has swapped hands to the one-generation newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D now, though the 7800X3D isn't hugely far behind. Thanks in part to both chips using 3D V-Cache. It's an eight-core, 16…",

Of course, TV and monitor formats and resolutions are not all exactly the same. See 1440p and ultrawide monitors for proof, equally, of that. Ars points out that the first 8K TV was announced by Sharp way back in 2012, with the first 8K OLED being released by LG in 2019. But wider adoption has been slow. While there are now, by the estimates of data firm Omdia, around one billion 4K TVs out there, only 1.6 million 8K TVs have found homes since 2015.

    "body": "Competitive gaming gear often isn't all that exciting. That's because, like the ill-fated switch to Dvorak or Colemak (if you had to Google that, it proves my point), players get used to a certain standard. You can't push the boat out too much or overcommit to a single selling point. Most competitive players simply want something that functions as they're used to, but better. That's why I was a little surprised to see competitive players as the target audience for Be Quiet!'s first foray into the gaming peripherals market. Unlike the Be Quiet! Light Mount and its wonderful dampened keys, the Dark Perk Ergo and Dark Perk Sym don't have noticeable gimmicks—they miss a USP. I can, however, say that the Dark Perk Ergo is clearly very well built. Despite holes in the bottom to cut down on weight, it's not flimsy. I can apply a lot of pressure on the side (be it for fun or because I've lost a round), and it doesn't move an inch. At 55 g, it's certainly on the lighter side, but Be Quiet!'s material choice is a good one, giving a mouse that could take a drop or jostle without a problem. The Ergo model is clearly a right-handed design, with its side buttons being on the left and a slight c…",

During the TWT Finals over the weekend, we were treated to a trailer for Season 3 which seemed desperate to tell us one thing: Tekken 8 is going back to basics, promise. It literally says that in the trailer, too: Season 3 goes back to basics. Refined balance. More conventional. More focused. More deliberate. A fresh start. It's a lot more straightforward and communicative than Season 2, which is certainly a good place to start. It's also exactly the kind of stuff players have been wanting to hear for the best part of a year. Hell, maybe even two. But how that philosophy will manifest itself remains to be seen.

However, some have sworn it's the way to go, once you're used to it, and I've had what I can only describe as a morbid curiosity ever since. It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller. In fairness, with Valve eventually selling the controller for just $5 by the end of its life , it seems like the general controller-wielding masses weren't massively moved by it…",

Shield TV , however, has been with us now for over a decade in some form or another—and according to Nvidia, the Android-powered set-top box is far from done yet. In an interview with Ars Technica , Nvidia's senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, talks in reverence about the Shield devices and what they mean to the company. Like all good ideas, it seems, Bell says the Shield project came from an enthusiastic group of engineers: \"Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,\" Bell opines. \"To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make... but in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.\" Through a series of acquisitions and partnerships, (including the purchase of PortalPlayer in 2007, which led to the Tegra Arm chips at their hearts), Nvidia gradually gathered the elements that would make up its early Shield iterations .

Bato was apparently the world's largest manga piracy website that hosted thousands of comics illegally, translating them and distributing them without permission from the rights holders. At this stage, it seems like the operation of the site is being pegged on a man living in Guangxi, China, who is under investigation and has, according to CODA, \"admitted to operating all of the related sites and is expected to be formally indicted in due course.\" Investigations are still ongoing, though, with more accomplices potentially being on the hook. CODA says that the case started \"following requests from Japanese publishers—Kadokawa Corporation, Kodansha Ltd, Shueisha Inc, Shogakukan Inc, and Square Enix Ltd.\" Yep, you read that right, Square Enix makes manga, too.

Originally Gamebryo, nowadays the Creation Engine, Bethesda's in-house platform, has been seen as the root of all evils in The Elder Scrolls and Fallout , the supposed cause of everything from instability to floaty combat to lumpy potato faces. In an interview with PressBoxPR , however, former Bethesda veteran and Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith has defended the studio's continued use of the engine, pointing to the huge disruption that would be caused by a changeover. \"It is a massive effort. You are talking about dozens of people spent doing nothing but making an engine work,\" says Nesmith. \"You are talking about putting your developers into a situation where they can't play the game. They may not even be able to work on making the game for long stretches because the engine is not there or up to snuff yet.\" He doesn't quite go as far as praising it, but he does seem to have faith in it as a platform that can continue to be modified and improved as needed. \"The Creation Engine has been tweaked to serve Bethesd…",

While the most reliable consumer processor category seems to have been a tough one to call, the company says that the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K was the most reliable individual chip overall, with a mere 0.77% failure rate across its sample size. Puget Systems also gives a shoutout to AMD's Ryzen X3D processors as having a better track record than its regular 9000-series chips, with a 1.51% failure rate, while Nvidia's Founders Edition GPUs are said to be the most reliable GeForce RTX cards sold by the company in 2025, with a mere 0.25% failure rate overall. The top processor may seem like a surprising pick, as it wasn't long ago that Intel was in the headlines for a host of CPU-crashing issues plaguing its older models. However, the Arrow Lake generation (along with microcode updates for 13th and 14th generation chips) appears to have steadied the ship considerably, and the 20-core Core Ultra 7 265K is something of a favourite around these parts, too.

The GPU was saved by wiring in the VRMs of an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card, creating a monstrous hybrid GPU that looked ridiculous, but appeared to work surprisingly well. Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.
