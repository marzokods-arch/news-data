    "body": "If you've ever fallen for a scam deployed by an account that looks like one of your friends but isn't, Steam is implementing a new pop-up warning that's intended to flag potential bad actors before they can send you links. In the latest Steam client beta , Valve announced a handful of changes and fixes, like better Xbox 360 controller mapping in Linux kernel 6.17, fixed timeline markers in game recording, and, most importantly, a new change to chat. Now, when you receive a \"potentially malicious\" message, Valve will add a \"suspicious chat warning that will appear at the top of the chat window.\" Given that Steam launched over two decades ago, and there were millions of dollars put into skins in games like Counter-Strike 2 , it's a bit of a surprise we didn't have this already. Players can emulate others through similar profile pictures or usernames, so it's not out of the question to think bad actors could fake credentials to get access to Steam users. A simple pop-up like this is a good idea for flagging potential bad actors, but it also disables links in chat while the pop-up is available. This means you have to acknowledge the suspicious chat warning to get access to links. Phis…",

Seriously, there are tons. I'll admit, I completely forgot this was a thing once the game had launched, and it's no wonder why, because these songs weren't actually in the game yet, just the credits and trailers. Well, if you've been jonesing for some legendary tracks, the time has come. With the launch of Season 1 , you can now find radios installed in vehicles in both core Battlefield 6 and the Redsec battle royale—just hold 'Q' to open the command wheel and select a station at the top. That's all well and good; you can listen to beats on the move, and there's nothing quite like dodging mines and rocket barrages while peacefully jamming out. However, what I was not expecting was a paywalled radio station. Those who own the Battlefield Pro version of the battle pass, which costs $24.99/£21.99, have access to an exclusive radio station creatively named Battlepass Radio.

Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

    "body": "Discovering Advanced Decryption Key locations in The Outer Worlds 2 is vital if you want to enjoy the game's best weapons and best armor. While you can find a selection of unique gear by exploring and completing quests, the best ones are sealed in High Security Lockboxes ; containers which require Advanced Decryption Keys to open. Once you've collected a lockbox containing an item you like the look of (you can view them all in the hold of your ship), you'll need enough keys to unseal it. Usually, they each cost about four to eight keys to open, depending on how good the item is, so you'll want to grab all you can while out and about. Outer Worlds 2 Advanced Decryption Key locations You need Advanced Decryption Keys to open High Security Lockboxes (Image credit: Obsidian) Below you'll find 26 key locations across the game's regions, most of which are in the initial area of Paradise Island. Advanced Decryption Keys are quite rare, and become much more scarce once you leave Paradise Island. I'd advise against spending them all at once. It's a better idea to only open a lockbox if it contains an item that fits your build or you want to experiment with. There are, of course, more keys …",

    "body": "Deciding whether to choose the Order or Displaced is the conclusion of the Present and Future Company Excluded quest you can undertake in The Outer Worlds 2 . While not a major choice by any means, it does decide the fate of refugees at the Matriarch's Mercy camp and monastery in Golden Ridge. One group, the Displaced, want to further expand their camp to solve the overcrowding problem and the tensions it's causing, while the Order, a group of predictive scientists and the residents of Matriarch's Mercy, determine that a disaster will occur if they do. In typical RPG fashion, you, a stranger who wandered into the camp, become a mediator who decides the fate of everyone. Here's what each choice entails. Should you side with the Order or the Displaced in The Outer Worlds 2? There are three potential choices you can make (Image credit: Obsidian) After you've been through all of your evidence with the Voice of the Displaced and Administrant Agarwal, you'll be asked to choose whether the Exclusion Zone should be turned into an expansion to the refugee settlement like the Displaced want, or whether it should remain excluded, which is what the Order desires. Here's what happens based on …",

Just as you've made it inside the observatory and are about to confront Seer Wiley, you'll find this puzzle off to the side, and it poses you three astrological questions. You're supposed to use the orrery (the moving map of the planetary system in the courtyard) to solve this one through observation, but it's understandable if you're antsy to keep progressing towards your climactic encounter with the seer and don't want to hang about solving planetary puzzles. For those in a rush or who are simply stuck, here are the answers to all three of the questions, as well as what you'll get for a reward. The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium The answer to this is 4 . If you head outside and look at the orrery in the main courtyard, you'll see that there are four moons rotating around the big central grey planet (Elysium). The second dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit between Dorado and Elysium The answer to this is 1 . Head outside, once again, and you'll see via the orrery that there's only one small green moon that orbits between Elysiu…",

There are a number of different pets you can find in the game, either by purchasing them from vendors, or acquiring them through sidequests. Here, I'll run through every pet I've found and how to acquire each one. Remember, if you want to pet or swap your cute and cuddly companion, you can interact with the pet barrel object in the room next to the medical suite, off to the side of the main chamber onboard The Incognito. Premium Edition Sprat (Image credit: Obsidian) Location : Premium Edition Technically, the first pet you can get in The Outer Worlds 2 is the Premium Edition Sprat by purchasing the Premium Edition of the game. When you wake up in The Incognito after the prologue, you should be able to summon this little fella at the pet station in the room next door to the medical area. You likely will have seen some Spratts already, but they're essentially rat-like creatures. You can also get the ED Drone pet from Commander Zane's B…",
