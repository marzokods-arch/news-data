I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate. Thankfully, that won't be the case for much longer. Hytale Update 2, which arrives in pre-release testing sometime this week, will add the ability to hide your helmet and armour. It was only a matter of time, really, …",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below.

Contrary to what you may have heard, voidhearts aren't exclusive to Void Eyes (the big floating eyes with tentacles). In fact, I've had the best luck getting them to drop from Void Spawns (the humanoid beasts with large swords).

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly.

The Last Titan, as it was announced back then, is gonna be taking players back to Northrend—and, per a recent interview by Game Informer , Midnight's reimagining of Silvermoon and the Ghostlands has been part of the process in sticking that landing. Director Ion Hazzikostas tells the publication that Silvermoon is \"going to inform our approach to Northrend or to other places we may revisit down the line. I think it's about striking a balance between nostalgia and freshness, having those familiar anchors the players are looking for and can't wait to see in fully modern fidelity. \"But also having expanded areas, clearly transformed areas, in a way that makes it abundantly clear that a lot of time has passed.\" Hazzikostas is relatively thin on details for the time being (which is fair, they've an entire expansion to get through before we're heading up north) but he explains that \"we definitely need to be very mindfu…",

Larian's previous game, Divinity: Original Sin 2, by no means caught on like wildfire, but it achieved nearly 94k concurrent players back when it launched in September 2017. Since then, it's been seeing 10-20k player peaks every month. That's all to say that Larian's games hang around like almost no other single-player RPGs do, even competing with live-service titles intentionally designed to maintain a consistently strong playerbase. Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of Divinity. D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.

The fact that I am only writing about this now suggests that PC enthusiasts are perhaps not all that interested in these CPUs, but they should be and for good reasons. First of all, the Alder Lake architecture marked Intel's first attempt at implementing a hybrid core design in desktop processors (it had done so previously with mobile-only Lakefield in 2020). Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs. All the 'Lakes' since the launch of 12th Gen Core have been hybrid, with the latest iterations ( Arrow Lake and Panther Lake ) boasting so…",

No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer.

While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both.

Oh, but ignore me. I’m just too British to understand this emotion you humans call ‘joy’. A fairly rote save-the-universe-from-aliens plot is livened up considerably by constant silly digressions. Like the side mission where one of my crew accidentally ingested hallucinogenic strawberries and convinced himself he was a bear. Or when another crew member went undercover as an obnoxious c…",

Instead, it's refocusing all its efforts on Vortex , its Windows-only mod manager that first hit alpha all the way back in 2018 (it's fully out now, mind you). Nexus announced the news on its site last week (via GamingOnLinux ), writing that it has stopped making sense—if indeed it ever did—to divide its development efforts between two separate mod managers that aimed to do the same thing (uh, manage mods). \"Instead of moving forward together, we were splitting our focus. Every feature built twice. Every bug fixed in two places. Every conversation about 'which one should I use' was a reminder that we were competing with ourselves instead of solving the actual problems in front of us.\" The short and the tall of it is that \"We're stopping development on the Nexus Mods App and focusing all our efforts on Vortex.\" Which, sure, makes sense. It is an odd move to develop two separate apps that try to do the exact same thing, but the death of the Nexus Mods App means the death of …",

The first murmurings about the feature came in Oct. 2025, when developer ZeniMax Online Studios confirmed to Forbes it was being worked on, and it came up again in a Reddit AMA last week when the studio said that while crossplay is still being developed, it \"won't be a 2026 item.\" In that same thread, though, executive producer Susan Kath confirmed that cross-progression is coming too: \"We will be doing crossplay and cross-prog at the same time,\" she wrote. It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work.

Here's the new trailer: The video is mostly cinematic, a stylish collection of environmental shots, fast cuts, and occasional bits of gunplay: Bungie is definitely going for a vibe here, and this trailer looks like it was built in a lab to drive hype and deliver the climax of a campaign to turn around what was looking like a full-on crisis for Bungie.

    "body": "If there's one thing that the tech industry really loves to do, it's speculate on the future, especially if someone of note in the sector has made some newsworthy remark. Of late, there seems to be quite a bit of talk about the future of the home PC and that it might end up going the way of the dodo, all because of something Jeff Bezos said. We have to go back in time to a little over a year ago, to when the founder of Amazon was interviewed by Andrew Ross Sorkin at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit . At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

    "body": "World of Warcraft 's changing in a big way— announced a while back , Blizzard's decided that you shouldn't have to download a huge list of UI mods (addons) just to play at a competitive level with others, and will kneecap the ones related to combat in this week's patch. Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.
