Instead, newer and more secular hits have once again swarmed the chart&#8217;s top regions — including &#8220;Choosin&#8217; Texas,&#8221; the late-2025 breakout hit for rising singer-songwriter Ella Langley . The catchy and quintessentially country heartbreak lament had previously peaked just outside the Hot 100&#8217;s top 10, but now rebounds all the way from 48-5 — marking Langley&#8217;s highest career peak to date, and her first visit to the top 10. How big a deal is this for Langley? And is her success part of Nashville turning a corner in its gender representation? Billboard staffers answer these questions and more below. 1. With the holiday rush finally clearing out of the Hot&nbsp;100’s&nbsp;top tier, Ella&nbsp;Langley’s late-2025 runaway hit “Choosin’ Texas” jumps 48-5 on the Hot 100 this week.

Besides these, Acer has also announced a budget 5K monitor for gamers and a premium 6K screen for creators. Acer is kicking off 2026 with a host of new launches at CES 2026 . While its updated portfolio of gaming laptops and consumer laptops takes the center stage, the brand is also showcasing new products, including a range of desktop monitors for gamers and professional creators. That comprises new products in the Predator, Nitro, and ProDesigner series. The new lineup includes the Predator XB273U F6 and X34 F3 gaming monitors. Both of these deliver palpable smoothness for high-speed gameplay. Of the two, the XB273U F6 supports a 500Hz refresh rate at QHD resolution and can clock 1,000Hz when downscaled to 1280 x 720 pixels. It’s backed by a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with a 2,000:1 contrast ratio and a claimed brightness of 350 nits. The panel is also calibrated to cover 95% of the DCI-P3 color space for saturated tones while gaming.",

Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

    "body": "Credit: LG TL;DR At CES 2026, LG brought back its Wallpaper TV in the form of the LG OLED evo W6. It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",
