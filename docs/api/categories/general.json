The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 8 could get a significantly thinner and lighter design compared to the Z Flip 7. It’s believed Samsung could reduce the phone’s thickness and weight by over 10%. This comes after the Galaxy Z Fold 7 received a radical redesign. Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Both corporations are projected to lose millions of dollars. Google is reportedly demanding a “special price,” lower than that of three bigger distributors. Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions. With its subscriber count estimated to be over 9 million in the US, that’s a cumulative loss of nearly $200 million for the tech giant. The los…",

Google Maps is a mostly reliable and robust mapping application on Android, but its problems become apparent when used through Android Auto.

Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back.

This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US.

One such contender is the Dreame H15 Pro CarpetFlex (), a flagship wet-dry vacuum with a self-drive system, RGB sensors, purpose-built interchangeable rollers, and an intelligent dust-suppression system. I’ve tested it for a few weeks around my home to see how it performs.",

The 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display pairs with 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, 4G data, and a physical AI shortcut button. It is available now, priced at $279.99, from Viwoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Viwoods’ newest AiPaper Reader just became the first E Ink device to ship with Android 16 . While Viwoods isn’t the first brand to blend E Ink with Android, it’s the first to do so on Google’s latest software, a distinction that hints at faster updates and a push to make e-readers feel less isolated from the rest of the Android ecosystem. Specs-wise, the pocket-sized e-reader is built around a 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display at 300ppi, offering faster refresh rates and higher contrast than older panels. With a design that measures 6.7mm thick and just 138g, it looks more like a small phone than a tablet, making it an easy everyday carry for readers who want something portable.",

This was especially true for new customers until fairly recently, as you could previously get a year of unlimited service for just $180 upfront, or what works out to an outstanding $15 a month. Unfortunately, this promo has finally ended, and so the same price will only net new customers a 15GB a month data allotment (currently on sale for $14 per month).

But if there’s one feature that makes the mobile version feel incomplete, it’s the lack of extension support. Since it is a highly requested feature, Google is working on bringing extension support to Chrome on Android , although we aren’t yet close to delivering it as a feature. Meanwhile, some other web browsers on Android already allow you to use extensions , and one of them is receiving a significant upgrade in this regard.
