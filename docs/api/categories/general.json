From Dec. 10–21, the sold-out concerts drew more than 520,000 fans to Estadio GNP Seguros, according to figures from the promoter Ocesa. The Puerto Rican chart-topper performed a nearly three-hour stadium set, transitioning between the main platform and the Puerto Rico-inspired “casita” before returning to wrap up the performance.

Although the &#8220;Fever&#8221; singer did not take home his first Grammy for Party With Me , he did spend 2025 playing his first U.S. shows in 20 years , winning the MOBO impact award, and launching his globe-trotting Worl&#8217; Boss Tour .
