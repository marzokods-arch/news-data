Pre-applied screen protectors are still the norm, and while they’ve gotten better, there will come a time when you need to replace them. Manufacturers want you to bring the phone back and have a professional do the job. But when the screen protector on my Galaxy Z Fold 4 gave up the ghost, I embraced my inner Jeremy Clarkson and asked: “How hard can it be?” The problem with foldable screen protectors",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

I had to learn to live life on life’s terms.” Jackson also addressed the mental health challenges she has faced during her sobriety, naming several conditions in her post. “Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder is a b&#8211;ch, so is PTSD and OCD,” she wrote. “If you’ve got this s&#8211;t or anything of the sort, you’re not alone.

At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",

The models I’ve been testing deliver a genuinely enjoyable viewing experience even in lighting conditions that used to send me scrambling for blackout curtains. Built-in Google TV also strengthens the projector push. It helps turn what used to be an obnoxious setup process into something refreshingly TV-like, especially since features like autofocus and auto keystone correction handle fine-tuning.",

Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

    "body": "TL;DR OnLeaks has published what appear to be images of Galaxy S26 dummy units. The units in the images should be nearly identical to the S26 series’ final designs. The Galaxy S26 series will have camera bumps that look quite a bit like the ones on Galaxy Z Fold phones. The new year is right around the corner, and that means we’re coming up on Galaxy Unpacked. The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

As color E Ink continues to try to escape the shadow of e-readers , the PicPak is the latest attempt to see where else the technology can go. The tiny E Ink display acts as a trendy, miniature digital picture frame you can fill up and forget about, thanks to extended battery life and storage for more than 500 images.

New details reveal what makes the device stand out and help clarify its place in the current market. Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate. At the center, the device’s 11.5-inch NXTPAPER Pure display uses a 3:2 aspect ratio with a 2200 × 1440 resolution. It supports 16.7 million colors, reaches 300 nits of typical brightness, and refreshes at up to 120Hz, giving it a clear responsiveness advantage over E-Ink alternatives.
