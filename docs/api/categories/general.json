    "body": "There's been a deep, unfortunate friction between voice actors and videogame studios, recently—the looming spectre of AI hangs large over everything, with some bigwigs salivating at the idea of getting infinite performances out of people without actually paying them. That is, despite the fact that—aside from efforts so far mostly being bland as all hell, and confusing for the actual voice actors —players seem to have a deep appreciation for human performances. This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront.

Listen, that last one is good, but it's terrible for fighting games thanks to its ridiculously mushy d-pad. Nobody wants a mushy d-pad when they're trying to rapid-fire directional inputs. And as someone who loves getting a long nail manicure, they were causing me to misinput all over the gaff. I tried fight sticks previously but couldn't get with the whole, well, stick part of it. Then earlier this year, I finally made the switch to a leverless controller. One that trades out any sort of analog inputs for a flat, all-button setup. And you know what? It's been a game changer.

Besides, that is, the standard routine of a new realm opening up in the Dream Castle, and needing an extortionate amount of Dreamlight to get there in the first place. This lack of information is what makes preparation for an update like this so important. Even though you likely have the funds to get into the new realm, you might not have the friendship levels or materials you need to start making your way through Cinderella's unlock quests.

Tactics RPGs about students who fight demonic analogues of small-town problems at night, yet have to balance that with school and social obligations by day? I'd say sign me up, but even the shorter ones take 80+ hours and the longer ones demand well over 100. I tried Metaphor: ReFantazio and gave up in boredom during the second dungeon. They are not games that respect your time. So Demonschool, which seems to basically be a Persona game in all but name and the fact it can be wrapped in under 40 hours, should have been an instant slam-dunk. Our reviewer, Mollie Taylor, liked it well enough , praising the intricacy of its battle system and the wit of its dialogue, but had an important reservation. At launch, it suffered from \"some wonkily-threaded narrative beats\" and \"some general visual bugs and systems that felt a little obtuse at times\". No problems that couldn't be patched it seems, which made me put it on the \"wait\" pile rather than the \"play immediately\" pile. With every update it shifts a little closer to that second pile, and the latest, which Demonschool developer Necrosoft is calling its second big post-release patch , seeming like a s…",

The mod drops players into the boots of the LSPD’s most infamous unit, CRASH, in a story that blurs the line between justice and vice. The result is something gritty and unmistakably GTA, and it’s being built by two people: Cascavel, a veteran roleplayer and modder, and giacobbe, a software engineer with a lifelong love for the series.

He spent years on a text-based server called Los Santos Roleplay, crafting characters and stories with hundreds of others in real time. \"That experience made me appreciate strong writing and believable characters,\" he says.

Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief.

They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer.

Get a bigger pair of bookshelf speakers if you're building an audiophile hi-fi setup, but for a warm sound in a stylish form that's easy to stick on your desk and connect to your PC or phone, I'm very happy with these.

While chatting about the nuts and bolts of their in-development Grand Theft Auto project, modders-turned developers Cascavel and giacobbe cited Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, Mafia, and Schedule I as sources of inspiration for their standalone game. Although details are scarce, the pair describe it as a systems-driven game with a strong narrative core—something that blends the charm and loop-based depth of life-simulators with the grit and atmosphere of crime dramas. \"We’re being tight-lipped for now,\" says giacobbe. \"We started overly ambitious—it would’ve taken us years. So we’ve refined the idea into something more realistic and achievable. Right now, we’re focused on building our MVP gameloop while balancing our modding commitments.\" The duo cite Schedule I in particular, a solo-developed breakout hit, as a major motivator. \"It wasn’t the financial success that inspired us,\" adds Cascavel, \"but the f…",

No, I'm not talking about Unreal, I'm talking about Half-Life: Element 64 , a fresh mod that released a demo today on Steam . After spending some time with that demo, I can say it's more of an asset flip into an original game with new levels and music than a mod merely tweaking Half-Life's mechanics. There's no train ride, no resonance cascade, nothing waiting for you in the test chamberrr ; it drops you into a level select hub not unlike Quake, HEV suit and all, and from there you'll be blasting away head crabs and vortigaunts in a matter of seconds.

Like roughly half of the internet, I am fascinated by Kowloon Walled City . Built on the site of a military fort, the Walled City was a Chinese enclave situated within former British Hong Kong. Its existence was tolerated by Britain provided China made no effort to exercise its jurisdiction. This peculiar legal status left it largely ignored by both nations, and as such it became the site of rapid, unplanned urban development through the latter half of the 20 th Century. At its height circa 1989, Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. More than 35,000 people lived in an area of six and a half acres, giving it a density ten times that of Earth's most tightly packed cities like Giza and Manila.

Still, 1440p remains the sweet spot for those of you looking for the best bang for your buck, and we've seen a steady march of excellent contenders released in the last year, so expect to see some good discounts, particularly for models with a larger panel size. 1080p stays as the budget choice, but given the influx of high refresh rate screens, it's safe to say this resolution is sticking around as the competitive choice for a while yet. And for those of you on a higher budget with a…",

The only bummer is that early pets aren't very strong, but upgrading the flute turns the instrument into a real game changer. Some classes start with a taming advantage (and the Beastmaster even ranks quite high in my 99 Nights in the Forest class tier list ), but the flute is available to everyone regardless of role. Every upgrade unlocks new animals to befriend too, so instead of squishy bunnies, you can roll up on the Cultist Stronghold with a Mammoth. To keep you from meandering too long, I've got a quick step-by-step on how to upgrade the Taming Flute in 99 Nights in the Forest. Then, after mastering the basics, I suggest checking out my complete list of tameable animals to start your own survival crafting zoo. How to get the Taming Flute in 99 Nights in the Forest (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games) You can get the Taming Flute for free at the animal shelter—it's sitting out in the open to pick up—or by giving the Pelt Trader a Wolf Pelt.

Even some of the mid-tier pets, like the Alpha Wolf, are a bit greedy. The angry pups demand more fish than I'm willing to catch during a normal run, but if I know I need to pacify one, I'll start hoarding Salmon day one. I have my pet preferences, but since some quests and badges require dabbling in a bit of everything, I've hunted and tamed every animal in 99 Nights in the Forest.

Its next patch will introduce two new superweapons to its near-future conflict—one for each faction—each with the potential to reshape the battlefield. Introduced to Tempest Rising \"by popular demand\" , the superweapons take the form of base structures and come equipped with a powerful standard ability, plus the potential to \"unload devastating payloads\" onto your opponent. The GDF's superweapon of choice is the drone strike station, which Slipgate summarises as \"a battle-management node that syncs directly with the GDF's satellite constellations to coordinate orbital strikes\". When constructed, it establishes a \"massive vision radius\" around itself, significantly expanding the range at which the GDF can use their intel-based abilities. (Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks) Once fully charged, the station can send a signal into orbit to call in a drone strike at player-designated coordinates. When you hit that big red button, nine drone turrets plummet to the ground like meteors, dealing massive explosive da…",

There's been no better time to try it than its 15th anniversary, as the original game is going for just $1.19 on Steam . That's the lowest it's ever been, with a price of $5.99 standing as the steepest discount recorded by SteamDB in the last two years: that's a jump from 70% to 94% off. You can also get the bundle with all the games in the series that made it to Steam for a little over $13. Thematically it's somewhere between a high school drama, Saw, and an Agatha Christie novel, with a psychotic teddy bear turning an academy into a prison of murder and mischief. While it is a visual novel, it's more gamey than the genre name perhaps implies: you investigate murders as they happen and try to pin the deed on the right culprit in a stylish minigame, literally \"firing their words back at them\" with metaphorical truth bullets.
