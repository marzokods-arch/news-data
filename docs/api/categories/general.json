However, the new update coming on Tuesday, December 9, not only adds a haunting new enemy, but an entirely new setting which already gives me the heebie-jeebies. In a trailer uploaded to the Red Barrels YouTube channel , Project Messiah has been revealed. This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge. Except, unlike a lot of churches I've been into, this one is filled with masked mannequins, statues, and of course—dead bodies. This is The Outlast Trials after all. But among all of the masked mannequins is Liliya Bogomolova, also referred to as Sister Liliya, who is adorned in an almost identical outfit to some of the mannequins.

That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March .

The skateboarding Grim Reaper Uncle Death also makes a return. Buy it now Download Let it Die: Inferno on Steam In the sequel, out now, you'll have to fight other players and monstrous creatures known as Yuckies as you search for a treasure known as the Eye of the Reaper. As you can see in the trailer above, this is a frenetic action game. You'll be wildly swinging your melee weapons to save yourself as you explore the ever-changing maps. Two is more than one, so you'll have both a right and left-hand weapon to dish out damage with. Be ambidextrous and swap which you want to focus on, or use both at the same time to smash through an enemy's guard. As a roguelite, the arms you come across will be randomized, and each has its use. Some deal more damage, some are better at range, and some disrupt your opponents and stop their movements, leaving them open for follow up attacks. Each time you descend, you'll …",
