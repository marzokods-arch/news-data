    "body": "When Google released Android 16 this past June, many users were disappointed by its lack of new features. Fortunately, the open nature of Android allows OEMs like OnePlus to add their own changes on top of Google’s releases. That’s exactly what OnePlus has done with its latest OxygenOS 16 update. It not only brings many of Android 16’s key features to OnePlus phones but also adds a host of additional features to improve your productivity, touch up your photos, make your phone feel faster, and more. Here’s everything new in OxygenOS 16! A new look and feel for OnePlus phones in OxygenOS 16 The biggest change in OxygenOS 16 is the new design. While not as extensive as Google’s Material 3 Expressive overhaul in Android 16, OxygenOS 16 is still a significant refresh. OnePlus divided the design changes into two categories: “Breathe With You” for visual refinements and “Thrive with Free Expression” for new customization options.",

The moment took over radio, TV and eventually the charts, with pop stars as massive as Nelly and Beyoncé eventually having huge hits influenced by this H-town movement. And while he might not have been the most obvious star for the moment, one guy ended up serving as the connective tissue for pretty much the whole thing: The People’s Champ, Paul Wall . This month on the Greatest Pop Stars podcast , our Vintage Pop Stardom spin-off series Vintage Almost-Pop Stardom is welcoming on first-time guests to look at really interesting artists during years in which they brushed up against pop stardom, but perhaps never quite got all the way there. Last week, we began with 1995 Björk , and this week we continue with 2005 Paul Wall, as the Texas writer Jonny Auping (of the excellent My Time Back newsletter ) helps us dive deep on the white rapper/jeweler who commanded the spotlight without ever hogging it, and who 20 years after his clear commercial peak, still maintains a higher universal approval rating than nearly any of his peers…",

It features TMR sticks, analog triggers, gyro controls, flip-out handles, an optional dock for external displays, and more. Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance.

Across several Reddit threads, such as this one , this one , and this one , affected owners describe the same behavior: a main Glyph segment suddenly turns on and stays lit, ignoring normal controls in settings. A few users say it started after using the Essential Recorder feature, while others noticed it appearing without warning during calls or at a specific time of day. Restarting the phone clears it, but only temporarily.",

According to Nothing, patent restrictions prevent Android manufacturers from making phones optimally compatible with MagSafe. A company trying to develop its own compatible magnetic system could expect to invest $10M or more. Years and years after smartphones first started supporting it, wireless charging is having a moment. And it’s all Apple’s Qi2’s fault. At least, while we’ve been able to drop phones on charging mats for ages, the convenience and efficiency of magnet-aligned wireless charging has only really taken off with the introduction of MagSafe accessories — and now with the arrival of Qi2 25W, Android devices are finally starting to get in on the action.

Various glitches and broken routines have tested people’s patience, even among those who’ve stuck by the platform from the start. Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw. Understandable as that is, his geospecific issue won’t apply to many of our readers, and the poll results below suggest that a majority of you are willing to roll the dice with Google’s smart home ecosystem at least one more time.",

The tool generates per-device QR codes that you and your contacts can scan to verify unique device keys. Google also mentions that links in texts marked as spam are now automatically blocked. Scams are everywhere in digital life, from phishing emails to “wrong number” texts to voicemails about nonexistent large purchases supposedly charged to your credit card. Ideally, you should be looking critically at any communication from sources you’re not familiar with, but scammers are getting sophisticated, and a little help spotting a suspicious message can go a long way. Today, Google’s highlighting a couple of recent Messages features that should help keep you (and your less savvy family members) out of hot water. The more interesting anti-scam feature Google is calling attention to is Key Verifier. Initially announced last year and further detailed in May, Key Verifier adds an extra layer of security that helps ensure messages are actually coming from the person you think they are, rather than a bad actor who may have gained access to their phone numbe…",

This made me wonder if I could just stick with an older adapter and receive pretty much the same charging experience. The thing is, the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s higher 39W power limit is locked behind a rarer 20V PPS charging protocol requirement, meaning most customers are looking at buying (another!) new plug.",

Evidence for this unreleased feature was discovered in the code of the Google TV Ambient Mode app, though it’s not yet live. When you’re relaxing at home watching a show on your Google TV , interruptions are the last thing you want. Still, a package delivery or a strange sound outside can pull your attention away. That’s why the customizable button on select Google TV remotes is so useful, as it can be configured to open the smart home panel , letting you view a camera feed or control other devices.

After the cap, speeds still drop to very slow levels, making it better suited for light to moderate users who rely on Wi-Fi. While not the cheapest overall, Tello’s plan includes free calling to 60+ countries, adding strong value for international callers. Tello is easily one of the very best prepaid options out there for those on a tight budget who don’t need truly unlimited data, but it’s typically not ideal for heavier users unless you keep most of your data consumption to Wi-Fi. Up until now, Tello’s $25 Unlimited plan has been capped at just 35GB of high-speed data, after which it essentially goes down to nearly unusable speeds that aren’t much better than dial-up. The good news is that Tello has officially changed its limit to 50GB, while keeping the same reasonably low price. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google reportedly began deploying a fix for these app crashes yesterday. The fix is supposedly implemented server-side, so affected users should be seeing the changes already. Making sure your phone is running all its latest software updates is supposed to be how you keep it operating at peak performance, right? After all, fixes and patches are designed to take care of bugs and ensure system stability. That may be the idea, anyway, but every once in a while we hear about an update that inadvertently introduces a few new glitches of its own, and somehow ends up breaking just as much as it fixes.
