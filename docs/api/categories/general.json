That's where the Payday 2 subscription option comes in: For $5 per month, you get \"full access to all available Payday DLCs.\" You can subscribe and cancel as you like—any progress earned in DLC content will be maintained even if you cancel your sub, so you can pick up where you left off if you resubscribe in the future—and all content will remain available for individual purchase as it's always been. \"With more than a decade of content behind Payday 2, we want to give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game,\" Starbreeze's head of …",

Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet.

Seeing the before and after pictures next to one another, it's clear how much was lost to the fog, aesthetically speaking. (Image credit: Konami / Fellow_Demo) The images with no fog look brilliant. The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine.

Need to Know What is it? A roguelike action RPG with a cast of Greek gods and goddesses. Release date: September 25, 2025 Expect to pay: $29.99 Developer: Supergiant Games Publisher: Supergiant Games Reviewed on: RTX 5090, Intel Core i9 12900K, 32GB RAM Multiplayer: Yes Steam Deck: Verified Link: Steam It took some time, but Hades 2 convinced me it was worth it: It's a sequel worthy of the title that expands but doesn't diminish what made the first game great. I did like aspects of Hades 2 when it launched in early access. Protagonist Melinoë's magical array of attacks were more immediately satisfying than Zagreus' at the start, and the new cast of characters, like Hecate and Nemesis, gave it a sharper, darker tone. I just couldn't get over how tedious it was. Because of its new crafting system, I had to mine ore and pick flowers on every run as if th…",

The set is called the Genesis Collection, though sadly Valve neglected the chance to name them all after Phil Collins songs, and can only be bought through an item called the Genesis Uplink Terminal: which is kind of a case, but not as we know it. A quick primer before we get into the functionality. Both CS:GO and CS2 award their players weapon skins or cases for hitting various in-game milestones. The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50). Weapon crates are pure RNG, and have their share of critics: some would say that the upfront cost and unknown outcome make them gambling. The new Genesis Uplink Terminal seems like a respon…",

I just wrapped up my 60-hour playthrough of all three acts, and I did not walk out of Pharloom with the same thumbs I started my journey with. I did almost all the mementos (I didn't bother with the Hunting Journal; I'm here to hit stuff, not collect things), got all the fleas , and alt+F4'd out of petty spite while trying to beat Seth's score in Flea Dodge. Managed it later, though. Shudder. Never again. Nice. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Silksong isn't just hard, though. It's actively mean-spirited at times. I've managed to write not one , not two , but three bench-based PSAs about hidden resting spots in terrible areas. At times, the game actively goes \"ner-ner\" and gives you a wedgie for daring to play; It hits you over the head with an Acme frying pan; It paints a tunnel on the side of the cliff, watches you splat into it, and then nicks your wallet while you're twitching on the ground.

Secure Boot is a security feature within the UEFI and used for signing Kernel-level code that runs on your PC to ensure it's not, er, dodgy. The idea is, if everyone agrees to sign their code using cryptographic keys, an OS and its apps can be more confident that malicious software is not running in the background, such as a rootkit or low-level cheat software. Game developers are increasingly turning to Secure Boot to ensure their anti-cheat software isn't bypassed. Battlefield 6 has become somewhat infamous for requiring Secure Boot, through EA's Javelin anti-cheat software, though Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat and Riot's Vanguard also require it. Secure Boot will be required to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, too. The flipside is, there are a good deal of people that don't trust various game developers to have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat applications.

Since this is a \"walking simulator\" and this logic applies to real life too, it may seem overly obvious. And it might be. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I know I'm not alone in that. Baby Steps is played from a third-person perspective and it lets you change whether the camera is oriented to the left or right of Nate. But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up. The physics in Baby Steps are detailed and fun to mess with, but even when you're just walking along seemingly safe surfaces, a simple obscurely placed rock can send you tumbling. It's fine to fall—sometimes in Baby Steps you have to fall—but…",

And hell, Epic was right: over 126,000 concurrent players flocked to it during its weekend stint, according to IGN , making it one of the most popular game modes on offer during that time. I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them. Sounds kind of fun in practice but hey, this is the internet we're talking about. What's an open voice chat without having a slur or two hurled your way, eh?
