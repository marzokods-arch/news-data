It's the biggest leveraged buyout in history, meaning that the new EA is instantly saddled with $20 billion of debt, and will face intense pressure to crank those profits. And it's also the latest step in the Saudi Arabian Investment Fund's mission to \"sportswash\" the brutal regime, by using its influence and ubiquity across entertainment industries to distract from some of the world's most appalling human rights abuses. As the crack team at PCG towers discussed the deal, one line stuck with me: \"I wouldn't want to be sitting in a BioWare chair right now.\" The vibes around one of the all-time great RPG studios have not been good in recent years, and the fairly decent Dragon Age: The Veilguard didn't persuade anyone that the studio is capable of surpassing contemporary greats like Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium. Early this year, the studio was apparently cut to the bone in a round of layoffs , though a new Mass Effect game remains in development. For now.

Things didn't go so well for longtime GTA producer Leslie Benzies, whose studio Build A Rocket Boy released MindsEye earlier this year. That was a bit of a disaster, to the extent the developer immediately went through a round of layoffs . Another departure was Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar who left in 2020 to establish Absurd Ventures, which is so far living up to the name by releasing a graphic novel, an audio drama, a novel, and recently announcing the Absurdaverse . Before leaving Rockstar, Houser was a lead writer on every GTA game since GTA London 1969 (released in 1999), and with GTA5 first releasing in 2013 it's not unreasonable to think he may have had some involvement there. Not so. In a new interview with IGN Houser says he had no involvement with GTA 6: \"They're always a new story. It's not going to be a story I wrote or a character set that I developed, but I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure.\" Houser's asked if it'll be a bit weird playing a new GTA…",

Valve said back in February that the Autumn Sale would fire up a couple months early for 2025: It didn't say why, but the obvious guess is to put more room between it and the Steam Winter Sale: In previous years, the big year-ending blowout would kick off just a couple weeks after the end of the Autumn Sale, and that's just not enough time between two of the biggest videogame sales of the year.

This week I've been: continuing to play way too much Borderlands 4 and waiting for Battlefield 6. One thing that surprised me from the Battlefield 6 beta back in August was that Battlefield Studios seemed to be aiming for a more casual, fast-paced experience. Smaller maps are one thing, but the remarkably frictionless weapon handling seriously ramped up the speed of shootouts and all but removed the need to tap or burst fire at longer ranges. Simply by slapping a single-port brake or the basic folding vertical grip on any weapon would immediately resolve any recoil issues. In this way, the Battlefield 6 beta felt an awful lot like a battle royale—Call of Duty Warzone being the elephant in the room—in which weapons are highly efficient at way further ranges than they really should be. It was a shame, considering Battlefield has long prided itself on being more realistic/grounded/authentic (you name it) than Call of Duty. It's also ironic, given that Battlefield 6 will actually have a battle royale component, and I've no doubt this more streamlined weapon handling was designed with…",

As a result, I now have one forearm bigger than the other. Stop writing your own punchlines, I beg of you. Hardware fashion trends, they come and go. Some of them even stick around, like case windows, RGB lighting, or hidden cable internal designs. But there's one relatively modern trend that I think is starting to turn from the sublime into the ridiculous, and that trend is slapping screens on components that really, really don't need them. Now, before I go full on \"old man shakes fist at cloud\", I'm going to start off with a heavy caveat. I can appreciate that, for some people at least, CPU temperatures are a major concern. Hidden underneath a substantial water block, or a skyscraper-esque tower of an air cooler, your machine's processor is a mysterious beast. Modern chips have a tendency to run hot, and can clock themselves down significantly if they hit their thermal ceiling. Plus, case windows are definitely here to stay.

Curry actually made a similar announcement almost exactly a year ago, releasing a video in which she announced there would be \"no more gaming videos\" from her—in effect, that she was retiring from the Let's Play life. But the following December, Curry felt the Skyrim urge once more and returned to the game, and even fired up Oblivion Remastered in May to check out Cyrodiil for the first time. So it's entirely possible that Curry might change her mind once again, and have a second come-to-Todd moment after a well-earned rest much like she did before. But I wouldn't put any bets down to that effect. Curry sounds tired, and in particular she doesn't seem to be getting the things she wants from her Skyrim uploads. \"I have a few older regular viewers\", Curry said, \"but most of them seem to be very young k…",

Capcom and Square Enix teamed up during Tokyo Game Show this weekend to show off a little more of the crossover. Monster Hunter: Wild's half is out right now—with hunters able to take on Omega Planetes—while Final Fantasy 14 joins the party on October 7 with The Windward Wilds trial that lets Warriors of Light face off against Arkveld. Even skimming through Final Fantasy 14's portion of the showcase this weekend, the encounter with Arkveld felt considerably more MMO-y than Monster Hunter. Which sounds daft, but not so much when you compare it to the game's previous collaboration with World which introduced a fight against Rathalos. While it was still quite MMO-like—it was literally in Final Fantasy 14, after all—it felt like there was a real concerted effort to integrate as much Monster Hunter madness as it could.

It turns out the seemingly perfect alternate dimension Peacemaker has been hanging around in is actually one where America lost to Hitler in World War 2.

It's not like I've got anything against them, but seeing a Battlefield 6 trailer with guest stars didn't fit the vibe that I thought Battlefield Studios was going for with this latest game. One of the biggest fears many players have had throughout the lead-up to Battlefield 6 was that it would unceremoniously morph into Call of Duty at some point, be that by adding ridiculous skins or with weird collabs that are out of place in its gritty battleground.

The over-reliance on literal toilet humor in Borderlands 3 was so universally disliked that a follow-up was always going to pare it back a bit. Which Borderlands 3 does, though sometimes too much. The villains in particular end up feeling like personality-free zones, some of them not even having enough going on to fill the empty space on their introductory title cards. They're just names and hit points. The sidequests squeeze in some of the personality the main questline leaves out, and even (whisper it) reference the occasional meme. My favorite so far is Forgive Me, a quest based on a viral joke about the storytelling in Soulsborne games—a joke tweeted by Borderlands 4 head writer Sam Winkler back in 2022. (Image credit: Sam Winkler) Because the internet is the way it is, Winkler ended up having to explain in the replies that he actually likes FromSoftware games, saying, \"I am begging anyone who thinks I'm dunking on fromsoft to learn how to make fun of the things you love\".
