Meanwhile, bluegrass group The Infamous Stringdusters offer up a country-tilted new track, while Chase Rice brings a rustic, introspective new song, and Lauren Watkins and John Morgan team up for a new collaboration.

This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 204, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black ar…",
