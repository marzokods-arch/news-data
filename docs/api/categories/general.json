These stores will be located in Queens Center, NY, Mall of America, MN, and Los Cerritos Center, CA. The company is offering an enhanced trade-in value of up to $800 for qualifying devices and the Galaxy Buds 3 for $99.99 if you visit before November 9. Who says that brick-and-mortar retail stores are dead? Samsung certainly doesn’t think so, as it plans to launch new physical stores across the US. And if you visit these stores within a certain amount of time after their grand opening, the tech giant is offering some special deals. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s still as elegant as when I first saw it, with its reduced front bezel and larger display, and more specifically with its eye-catching Jade color. I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025. What you can’t see are the two major upgrades under the surface, and in my opinion, even though they don’t justify upgrading from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to the 10 Pro Fold, they do mark a new era for foldable hardware.",

If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.
