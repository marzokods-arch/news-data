This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi.

The FCC teases further interest in backpedaling on labeling requirements it believes “provide minimal benefit to consumers.” When you’re signing up for internet access, how confident are you about what your bill’s actually going to look like? ISPs and cellular carriers both have a reputation for positively opaque billing practices, piling on fees and passing taxes along to end users. As a consequence, responsible lawmakers pushed for legislation aimed at simplifying bills, and forcing ISPs to be upfront and clear about all their fees. But right now, current FCC leadership is doing its darndest to undo some of those changes and make things easier for the ISPs. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

User Setati said that their Echo Show 5 had stopped persistently showing the time on its home screen, instead surfacing news and other content. Setati says that canceling Alexa Plus removed the unwanted additional content from their Show 5’s screen. Alexa Plus is Amazon’s new paid digital assistant. Available for $20 per month (or included for free, if you’re a Prime subscriber), Alexa Plus injects extra AI functionality into your Amazon devices, like the ability to engage in more natural conversation-style interactions with Alexa through an Echo device. Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables.

Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

The company notes that “not every type of channel termination will be eligible” but seems intentionally vague on details. YouTube policy enforcement isn’t great, to put things mildly, and the platform has a reputation for often being unnecessarily difficult for creators, exposing them to spurious copyright claims and the like. But for all the ways YouTube struggles there, we’ve had to give Google credit for the steps it’s taken to silence some of the worst people you’ll find both on- and offline, spreading politically motivated lies and doing real harm through their messaging. And now, in all its wisdom, it’s letting them back . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The change isn’t live in any user-facing version of Maps, but we expect it could be coming soon in an update. Google’s still engaged in a years-long project to replace the legacy Google Assistant with its newer Gemini AI assistant across its entire ecosystem. It looks like Google Maps navigation is next in line for that treatment. Experimenting with version 25.41.03.815390258 beta of the Google Maps app, we were able to activate a new Gemini integration. When enabled, this integration sees Gemini respond when you tap the microphone icon in the top right corner of the navigation interface, rather than the the Google Assistant. This is the second in-progress Google Maps/Gemini integration we’ve spotted this week.",
