As usual, Keighley is playing his cards close to the vest about what announcements will be in the show. A few appearances are already confirmed, such as Resident Evil 9, Exodus, and a performance from Evanescence (sure to bring the crowd to life). Of course, there are also the far less certain rumors about what will appear based on a mix of insider reports and good ol' gut feelings. For instance: That Assassin's Creed 4 remake that Ubisoft refuses to say is real has gotta be imminent, right? Here's what we know about The Game Awards 2025 so far. Confirmed trailers We know for sure we're getting a \"terrifying new look\" at Resident Evil Requiem during The Game Awards.

To be more accurate, her exact words were \"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy. You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\" She added later in the interview that what Lucy and the Ghoul have is a \"really beautiful thing\" and said \"they're both looking for the people that they love; let's leave it at that.\" Much like Walton Goggins in that clip, who remarked he had never heard of this pairing with a beaming smile, Ghoulcy was not on my radar. However, there is a small but fanatical subreddit dedicated to the theoretical ship. It doesn't seem like they're taking the news well; one comment from user Funishin replied to a thread about the interview saying, \"Writers are too cowardly to make Ghoulcy actually happen.\" I shouldn't be surprised; the internet is …",

It's got its issues, like outdoor decor limits being somewhat stingy at present—but Blizzard has otherwise hit the nail on the head. Objects can be scaled, rotated, and clipped into each other to your heart's content, which has already led to some excellent creations.

    "body": "The Undertaker Remembrance is fairly simple compared to many of the other Nightfarers in Elden Ring Nightreign . There's only one step that's likely to trip you up, as you help this corrupted abbess search for the Scholar in Limveld. The reason this step is so hard is because it's entirely inaccurate; the Scholar is actually in The Great Hollow event. I guess that's technically in Limveld, even though it's an entirely different map. As you'll quickly discern from the Remembrance entries, the Undertaker is a nun who started consuming the night corruption, hence the rather questionable screenshots circulating of her licking night juice off the wall while the Scholar watches her. Hey, who am I to kink shame? After you reach Chapter 6, you apparently have to defeat Heolstor in order to get the Dismembered Finger item, and then drop it next to the body during the ending. This should get you her Remembrance skin. I haven't done that bit myself yet, but I'll add details when I do. Otherwise, here's how to complete everything up to that point.

While the move had been long planned and not unexpected, the change did have one disappointing outcome: every game that used 32-bit PhysX libraries for visual effects would be forced to either disable it or process them on the CPU. Well, not any more, as Nvidia has had a change of heart and it's back again in the latest driver set. However, it is worth noting that the new Game Ready Driver 591.44 drivers won't suddenly run every 32-bit CUDA program, as Nvidia has only added support for certain games. Fortunately, it seems to be all the popular ones that were badly affected by the CUDA change, as detailed in the relevant driver blog . The full list of revitalised games is: Alice: Madness Returns Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Batman: Arkham City Batman: Arkham Origins Borderlands 2 Mafia II Metro 2033 Metro: Last Light Mirror’s Edge Batman: Arkham Asylum will eventually join the others, but not until \"the first part of 2026\".

It's been one year since I first reviewed the (now Sandisk) WD Blue SN5000 , and boy oh boy, what a year it's been. That drive, at the time, didn't have a lot going for it. It was hot. It was slow. It was beaten by cheaper options, and thanks to using aging QLC NAND flash, it didn't quite deliver on the promises it made in a way that it needed to. Thankfully, the brand spanking new Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 I have here on review remedies practically every single one of my initial complaints. From a newer, refined controller to far more advanced (though still QLC) NAND flash package with higher densities and better all-around performance, it makes a damn good argument for being one of the best SSD s money can buy, at least if the price is right.

That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment.

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Windrose now on Steam Previous trailers showed off the character creation menus, along with some combat, building, and farming, but this is a more distilled look at the kind of combat we can expect in game. It begins as we make off from our shuttered island sanctuary, complete with a grandfather clock, brimming bookshelf, and gorgeous marble planters decorating the terrace. My eyes are on the writing desk by the window that's buried beneath a mass of what I can only assume to be tasty, tasty treasure maps. Moving toward a small armada docked at the quay, we zoom in for a quick closeup shot of a tricorn-wearing player character, hands caked in tattoos and eyebrows out to the brim of his hat.

The company split up while working on Open Roads, and Gaynor's management was a central cause : He admitted that his strengths \"do not lie with attempting to manage a large project or direct the work of others.\" \"I hope that along with continuing the self-reflective work of the last couple years and moving forward with a sense of humility, that by taking Fullbright down this new path I'm able to make my next steps positive, productive ones,\" Gaynor wrote in 2023 when he announced that he'd started work on a new game on his own. That path first led to Toilet Spiders, a small horror game about scouring an abandoned government facility, lifting up toilet lid after toilet lid, hoping you find a key rather than a deadly spider.
