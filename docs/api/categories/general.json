This week, Luke Combs is feeling wistful, Leon Thomas is feeling vindictive, and of course, the most anticipated pop release of the entire year is finally upon us. Check out all of this week’s picks below: Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl Yes, Taylor Swift &#8216;s finally back doing big pop, and yes she&#8217;s got Max Martin and Shellback in tow again — but 1989, Pt. 2 this ain&#8217;t . The Life of a Showgirl has some of the big drums and plenty of the big hooks of this trio&#8217;s extended collaboration a decade earlier, but the songwriting and sonic palette are both updated for the mid-2020s, with many tracks based around an organic-skewing pop-rock sound more reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac than Forever Your Girl . Plenty of its songs seem destined to impact on a similar scale though: &#8220;Actually Romantic&#8221; and &#8220;Wood&#8221; will be the headline-grabbers for their provocative subject matters, but &#8220;Ruin the Friendship&#8221; and &#8220;Eld…",

Swift’s last album, 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department , may have scored the superstar’s biggest opening-week debut and ruled the charts for months on end, but the sprawling, relatively mournful project was a departure from the immaculately constructed pop anthems that had defined her career (give or take a Folk-more ) for a decade. When Swift announced that its follow-up was created in Sweden during the Eras Tour with pop geniuses Max Martin and Shellback &#8212; who helped create some of Swift’s most enduring pop smashes from the mid-2010s, and who hadn’t worked with her in eight years &#8212; the expectation of wall-to-wall bangers that Swift set seemed attainable, given their skills and shared history. The timing for a return to anthemic pop felt right, too: with Swift recently engaged to NFL star Travis Kelce and the Eras tour conquering the world, a full-length celebration seemed to be in order.

She was just 13 years old when she played Miley Stewart, a teenager leading a secret double life as a Malibu student by day and a global pop star by night. The show ran until 2011. After her success on the show, Cyrus made a bold transformation with a more edgy and provocative image, releasing albums like 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed and 2013’s Bangerz , the latter debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses.

The leak corroborates the feature activates automatically in crowded spaces. It also suggests users will have the option to choose which aspects to restrict and which ones to allow. The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well.

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone.

Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube TV needs to renew its carriage contract with NBCUniversal. The service is reportedly frustrated with the high rates it pays, and wants to leverage its size for a better deal. The companies have since reached a short-term extension. Update: October 1, 2025 (3:03 AM ET): YouTube TV has announced that it’s reached a short-term extension with NBCUniversal. The two parties are still negotiating a longer agreement, though. You can read the full story here . Original article: September 25, 2025 (6:02 PM ET): Is there anything more pathetic than when big companies take their petty spats public? You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation.",

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon is launching a smart light switch that doubles as a remote control. The remote’s four buttons are programmable, and each one can activate an entire smart home routine. Sales open October 30, when the remote will be priced at a mere $19.99. Amazon unveiled its fall 2025 hardware lineup today, complete with new additions to the Kindle , Fire TV , Echo , Blink, and Ring families. Tie all that together with the AI processing power of Alexa Plus , and you’re looking at a pretty solid collection, capable of pulling off some seriously impressive technological feats. And my favorite thing there might have been a dinky little $20 light switch. To be fair, this is more than just a simple switch, and the $19.99 Amazon Basics Smart Dimmer Switch and Remote for Music and Routines does a whole lot more, as its mouthful of a name should hopefully convey. It may live on your wall, but pops right out at a moment’s notice to serve as a convenient remote control.",

    "summary": "A small but important tweak.",
    "body": "TL;DR Currently, when you search for an app on the Pixel Launcher, tapping the bottom-right keyboard button searches the app’s name on Google Search. Some users are seeing that keyboard button change to an arrow/open shortcut, allowing you to quickly open an app right from the keyboard. Google only appears to be testing this with a small number of users, with unclear plans for a wider rollout. The Pixel Launcher ‘s search bar is already one of its best features, allowing you to quickly perform a Google Search or find an app right from your home screen. According to some user reports, it appears that the latter functionality may soon receive a notable upgrade. As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it. If you tap the search button at the bottom right of your keyboard, the Pixel Launcher (annoyingly) searches for the app name on Google rather than opening it.",
