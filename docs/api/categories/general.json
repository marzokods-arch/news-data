Turns out, it's exactly because Valve doesn't want that sense of continuity between the two. \"This is a new product. That's one of the reasons we changed the name from Valve index to Steam Frame, because we're trying to do something new with this,\" says Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve, during our visit to the company. \"We're really trying to blur the lines from your catalogue, where you just think about, you have your games, this is another device that lets you enjoy them. So I don't want to put too many sort of preconceived expectations on how people will use this.\" The Valve Index is an accessory for a gaming PC. Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so. The Steam Frame contains its own Arm-based processor and runs SteamOS to be able to play games without requiring a second PC. It's a great experience, too, as you can read in my Steam Frame hands-on . \"If you think about the Valve Index, awesome…",

The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community. But it's important to note that there remains a small number of people that argue that it was, in fact, a good controller. It even has a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam to this day.

It is the gaming PC. For this demo, however, Half-Life: Alyx is running on a PC nearby.

The SanDisk Extreme Fit USB-C flash drive looks to be a real tiddler of a USB device, so much so that SanDisk says you can leave it in the side of your laptop for \"everyday use and travel.\" I think you'll probably have to for safekeeping, as it looks small enough to be lost the second you pull it from the box. It's also not the fastest drive in the world, given its 400 MB/s top read speed for the 128 GB to 1 TB versions, but it's still a fair bit quicker than your average USB stick. Yes, it comes in a variety of capacities, although interestingly SanDisk is claiming the world's smallest crown for the 1 TB variant specifically. I can only presume that somewhere out there exists a low capacity drive no bigger than a USB Type-C connector itself, greedily holding on to the \"smallest USB Type-C drive that isn't 1 TB\" title. Anyway, something that strikes me about the overall design is how it sits slightly proudly over the top of a laptop bottom deck in the product photos.

I can finally let those frustrating memories go—Raccoin's machines will let me win, and win spectacularly. The structure is simple—each round, I get a certain number of coin drops (which I can aim rather more precisely than with a real machine) and have to try and reach that round's target score. That score translates to prize tickets, and between rounds I can tip the odds in my favour by spending them on special coins, power-ups, and passive bonuses. It's a very simple thrill at first.

I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be. To what's right for them. It started with custom PCs, moved on to keyboards, and is now spilling over into almost every area imaginable in this humble little hobby of ours. This isn't the first time we've seen custom mice; ones with swappable plates and grips have existed before the Pathfinder, but no other comes even close to matching what Orbital provides with this setup. It's utterly astonishing. Is this the best wireless gaming mouse of 2025? Honestly? Probably.

Today's patch, which kicks off the roadmap schedule, includes some welcome polish: a save on exit feature, a crash fix, and two dozen or so assorted bug fixes. The rest of the roadmap stretches beyond a Christmas-themed winter update and into next year, though it's a little light on details; there's a Valentine's Day update, and two DLCs due for the latter part of 2026.

The trouble is, 3D V-Cache-equipped AM5 chips are usually quite pricey. Those looking for a properly sub-$300 beastie with AMD's game-crunching cache tech (the 7600X3D has an MSRP of $299, and usually retails for a lot higher than that) have traditionally had to make do with chips built for the previous-gen AM4 socket, like the Ryzen 5 5700X3D .

However, while the internals of the TV are relatively compact for the era, fitting them into a console-friendly frame and interfacing them with modern hardware turned out to be quite the task. After reaching out to a number of exper…",

    "body": "Bungie's next game, the troubled reboot of Marathon , is most easily described as an extraction shooter—currently the hottest genre on the planet due to the enormous success of Arc Raiders . But if one former Bungie developer had got his way, Marathon wouldn't be an extraction shooter. Not because he would have made the game differently, but because he hated the term so much, he wanted to change it. Speaking on the Shooter Monthly podcast (via TheGamePost ), Bungie's former director of product management Chris Sides said that he thought about collaborating with the studio's marketing team to come up with a different term for extraction shooters, one that presumably would have been pushed in the runup to Marathon's launch. The reason for this, Sides says, is the vagueness of the term. \"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like: \"Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb. It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic.\" Sides then elaborated on why he broug…",

Last night's State of Play trailer for inKnobini: One store. Many stories renewed the excitement I felt after playing inKonbini's short demo over the summer. Set in '90s rural Japan, it captures the unique energy Japanese convenience stores have—there's a sense of care and reverence to truly provide a service to the community. I wouldn't want to do a Tesco simulator , but this, I like. As someone who works in customer service, it's not something you'd think I'd want to replicate in my downtime—that being said, I took a busmans holiday in Two Point Museum this year and thoroughly enjoyed it—but Two Point has a knack for turning the mundane into goofy Aardman-style skits.

According to the presentation slide, and CTO Mark Papermaster, Zen 6 and Zen 6c will launch in 2026. Zen 6 \"was the first tape-out in TSMC 2 nm\", and the slide says that Zen 7 will be based on a \"future node\" at a yet-undisclosed future time. In a different presentation for the Financial Analyst Day, Jack Huynh, senior VP and GM for the Computing and Graphics Group, presents a slide laying out the APU (accelerated processing unit) roadmap, which for us is of course most relevant to handheld gaming PCs . On this front, apparently we'll be seeing 'Medusa' APUs in 2027, which will presumably mean the first big new architecture for APUs, ie, chips with powerful integrated graphics for efficient light gaming in low-power laptops and handhelds.

Though the 240 Hz is only available when hooked up to a PC. It'll run at 120 Hz connected to PlayStation consoles. Aside from the resolution, refresh rate and panel type, the rest of the speeds and feeds are unclear. Sony doesn't quote response times or brightness. Even the quoted HDR capability is awfully vague. \"High Dynamic Range support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping that automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring rich and vivid picture quality,\" is what Sony says, which could mean almost anything from very basic HDR signal support right through to full-array local dimming. That said, you might have expected Sony to make a big deal about any fancy backlight tech on offer. So, we're probably talking about the most basic entry-level HDR support for this monitor.

But despite its busy setting, Coffee Talk Tokyo will still offer \"a cosy place to be\" for anyone who passes through its doors, which is bound to be a welcome relief in a virtual rendition of the most populated city in the world.

At the 1:15 mark in the trailer above, Artorias of the Abyss from the first Dark Souls appears as a new addition to the pool of bosses you'll have to face before one of the end-of-run Nightlords. He's not the first Dark Souls boss to apear in Nightreign: DS1's Gaping Dragon is in the game, too, as one of the easier bosses to dispatch. Something tells me Artorias will be a bit more of a challenge. That something is probably my memory of fighting Artorias in his namesake DLC for Dark Souls, Artorias of the Abyss, released in 2012.
