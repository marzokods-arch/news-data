The pop artist was the musical guest Tuesday night on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon , where he performed his new song “Changes” and sat for a chat with the late-night show’s host. At the top, Puth confirmed what many of his fans already. “I’m gonna be a dad,” he told Fallon. We&#8217;re aware of the good news because Puth used the music video for “Changes” as the platform for his big reveal. Around the 2:30 mark in the Charlotte Rutherford-directed clip, Puth and his wife Brooke Sansone both place their hands on her belly, a sign that changes are coming. “I didn’t leave much up to the imagination there,” he admitted to Fallon. “But yeah, we’re expecting a baby in March.” He’s not giving away the gender just yet, but it’s safe to say the bub will be immersed in music. Puth plans to revisit what him mom did for him, by placing headphones on Sansone’s pregnant tummy. “I hope baby likes music, because it’s the only thing I’m good at,” he quipped. “I think I listened to James Taylor and Luther Vandross, I got a wide array of music. So I’ll do the same thing, whether Brooke likes it or not.” This will be the …",

Chu’s&nbsp; Wicked with routines set to songs from the popular musical-turned-film.&nbsp;Chu even stopped by to join regular judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli. Irwin gave it his best shot with a jazz performance of “Dancing Through Life”. The 21-year-old and his professional partner Witney Carson completed an energetic, free-flowing performance with smiles glued to their faces. Irwin gave viewers a little more than they bargained with a perfect dolphin dive early in their routine, and pulled off a floor slide that&#8217;d make Bruce Springsteen proud. When the votes were counted, 39 out of a possible 40 points went to the pairings of Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa, and Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas, while Irwin and Carson nabbed nines from all four of the judges, for 36/40.

    "body": "John Williamson , the Australian “bush music” legend, has criticized a nationwide anti-immigration protest where his signature song, “True Blue,” was reportedly played without his approval. Thousands gathered in several Australian capital cities last Sunday, Oct. 19 for the “March for Australia” rallies, which formed as a collective voice against the federal government’s immigration policies, and for counter protests. Williamson, not for the first time, has called out the unauthorized use of his music. Turning to Facebook , Williamson writes: “‘True Blue’ is a song for all Australians and should not be hijacked by any group that seeks to use the song to sow division. I believe in a multicultural society &#8211; one where all Australians come together in unity to celebrate our unique multicultural nature and freedoms.” A decade ago, the ARIA Hall of Famer put conservative event organizers on blast for attempting to weaponize his famous song. Back in 2015, he shared a post on Facebook in which he noted that “True Blue” was reportedly being used at rallies by various groups including the Reclaim Australia movement, and “did not have my approval to use it.” On that occasion, he wrote,…",
