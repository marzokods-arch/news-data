Southwest Airlines is partnering with T-Mobile to provide its travelers with free Wi-Fi during flights. While you might assume this benefit only applies to T-Mobile customers, the scope is broader. Anyone who signs up for a free Southwest Rapid Rewards account can access in-flight service powered by T-Mobile, regardless of their wireless provider. T-Mobile has long offered free in-flight texting and Wi-Fi options on select plans, but those relied on partnerships with providers like Hughesnet, EchoStar, and ViaSat. With the advent of T-Satellite, T-Mobile is now directly powering in-flight connectivity across entire airline fleets.",

If you prefer taking matters into your own hands, you’d be glad to learn that the Pixel 10 series has made battery repairs slightly easier than before, but a lot can still be improved. The good folks at iFixit took apart the base Pixel 10 to see just how repairable it is.

Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

You only get the discounted price for two months, but a $66 benefit is better than none. If you’ve switched over from a traditional cable TV, you probably know about virtual providers like YouTube TV, DirecTV, or Hulu. However, if you haven’t and want to explore cutting ties with a traditional TV operator, YouTube TV could be one of the more beneficial options. The base pack starts at $82.99, which isn’t cheap but feels justified for the features it offers . And for its existing customers, YouTube TV is introducing a new discount offer that saves $33 per month. Reddit user oestred recently discovered a discount offer that reduces the monthly cost to $49.99, resulting in a $33 monthly savings. However, you must note that the offer applies only for two months, and your subscription costs will revert to the original price from the third month onwards. Despite that, it doesn’t sound like a bad deal, but you must act quickly, since we don’t know how long the offer will last.",

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025. Most e-readers stick to the basics: an E-Ink screen, a bookstore tie-in, and enough battery to survive a long vacation. At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an “AI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.” This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed. On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn’t shared an actual usage estimate.",
