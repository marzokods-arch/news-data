Simply put, folks who want to avoid spooky songs around All Hallows’ Eve don’t have a ghost of a chance. And while we all have our favorites, there are some seasonally appropriate songs that loom larger in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 than others. We decided to round up the 25 Biggest Halloween Songs based on their Hot 100 chart achievements (see below for a detailed explanation). No bones about it &#8212; the results might leave some people howling mad. Frightening as it may be to fans of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson’s iconic “Thriller” isn&#8217;t in the top 20 of this list of 25 songs (it peaked at No. 4 in 1984 and spent 22 weeks on the chart), though it’s inarguably a perennial staple – one as essential to the season as those holding Frankenstein’s Monster together.
