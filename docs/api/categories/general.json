That’s pretty long range, and as a very, very, very amateur astronomer, I wondered whether OPPO’s lens kit would be a gateway to some even more amateur astrophotography. Given the rise of brilliant camera phones , computational photography, and dedicated astrophotography modes, I set out to answer whether smartphones are finally catching up to entry-level telescopes for casual sky-watching. Before I braced myself for the cold, I did some quick math to set my expectations. “My Newtonian telescope has a 750 mm focal length, just bright enough to make out nebulae and galaxies on a dark night, such as Andromeda, with a 28mm lens (27x magnification).",

Which manufacturers excelled this year and which ones had a bad time, though? Well, I decided to rank major Android brands from worst to best, based on how well their year went. I took into account their products, innovations, software/updates, overall strategies, and more to create this best-to-worst ranking. Disagree with my list?

New photos of the phone have surfaced, showing what looks like a plastic back in a blue-green colorway. An official reveal is expected in early 2026. The phone may not end up being released in the US. We heard that OnePlus was prepping a new line of phones to be sold under the name Turbo earlier this month . A little later, leaks indicated that the a new OnePlus phone — potentially the first OnePlus Turbo — was being developed under the codename Volkswagen , and that it’ll come with an enormous 9,000 mAh battery. Now, courtesy of a new leak, we’ve seen what appear to be live images of the forthcoming OnePlus Turbo. Android Headlines has published live images of an unreleased OnePlus device that it says is the Turbo. It looks like a standard-issue midrange Android phone, with flat edges and a glossy back that appears to be made of plastic. The model Android Authority shows off is shown in a bluish green color.",

If you’ve ever used BlueStacks to emulate Android games on your PC, you’ll know ads are part of the deal, but the popular emulator is now offering a way around that. The company has just announced BlueStacks Prime, a new monthly subscription that offers an ad-free experience and other perks. According to a post on the BlueStacks support site , Prime is positioned as a premium layer on top of the existing emulator rather than a replacement. The headline feature is ad-free gameplay across the App Player, but subscribers also get 500 NowBux every month (worth $5), extra discounts on select in-game purchases, and faster access to support.",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

Instead of two AI hosts chatting things through, Lecture appears to stick to a single narrator delivering a continuous, lecture-style explanation that can run for up to half an hour.

Leaked information suggests that the rotary mechanism may adjust optically variable zoom levels and includes aesthetic cues, such as custom watermarks and red Leica engraving. Xiaomi is gearing up to launch the Xiaomi 17 Ultra flagship on December 25, promising great specifications for its top-of-the-line smartphone experience.

Yesterday was Day 8, and the group put out another three-plus hours of livestream, continuing the tiring endeavor of folding and unfolding the phone repeatedly.

A couple of months back, user Blazgamer posted on the r/GooglePixel subreddit that photos they’d taken on a trip failed to appear Pixel 9. Earlier today, user portmafia9719 described a similar experience on Pixel 10 Pro .

Familiar Face detection should be more accurate, and Google’s AI should be better at telling between cats and dogs at a distance. AI-generated descriptions of people and summaries of videos should be more accurate and detailed. Google’s announced the latest wave of updates for the Google Home app. An update rolling out today brings a number of improvements to the Nest camera experience, including changes that should make your cameras better at identifying people and animals. In a help forum post, Google outlines a handful changes that are making their way to users beginning today. Thanks to changes in the Familiar Face feature, Nest cameras should be getting better at identifying individual people. Google also says its cameras will be better at distinguishing between dogs and cats at a distance. Animals should also appear with more accurate colors in low light.",

The Brazilian court argues that because Brazilian citizens have accessed Yout, Nader is subject to Brazilian law. Nader may appeal the verdict, which imposes fines or potential jail time. Yout is an online utility that lets users download copies of videos from various sources, including YouTube. Founder John Nader insists that the service Yout offers doesn’t break the law — but a Brazilian criminal court disagrees. File sharing blog TorrentFreak reports that last week, a judge of the 12th Criminal Court of São Paulo issued a ruling against Nader, imposing a hefty fine for violating Brazil’s copyright laws.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung is hosting its CES 2026 “First Look” event on January 4. Ahead of that date, the company has released a teaser video previewing some of its announcements. So far, though, the video only appears to highlight home appliances, and doesn’t seem to include new mobile hardware. Update, December 22, 2025 (2:12 PM ET): Sure enough, those “appliance” vibes we were getting from the teaser video appear to be spot on. Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",

Single Take and Dual Rec can be reenabled through the Camera Assistant app. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta that dropped earlier this month introduces plenty of small quality-of-life improvements , but mobile photography buffs weren’t pleased to see that it also removed a couple of niche camera app features, Single Take and Dual Rec. A second One UI 8.5 beta released today brings those features back, but makes them a little harder to access than they were before. SamMobile reports that the Single Take and Dual Rec camera modes are accessible in the second One UI 8.5 beta via the latest version of Samsung’s Camera Assistant app. Prior to One UI 8.5, the two modes were baked into Galaxy phones’ standard camera app.",
