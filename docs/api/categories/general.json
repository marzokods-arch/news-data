We’re slowly and steadily marching towards the release of Android 17 , which could come with new features such as a long-awaited native App Lock solution. We already have a decent idea of how this rumored feature would work, but there were a few unknowns, one of which was how the feature would handle incoming notifications from locked apps. Thanks to the Android Canary 2601 release , we have an answer. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

And even if you went the robot lawn mower route before, installing base stations and perimeter wires is another complicated and tedious chore. Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

It’s called the Clicks Power Keyboard, and it snaps onto the back of your phone via MagSafe/Qi2 magnets — instantly turning your phone into a modern-day BlackBerry. Compared to Clicks’ keyboard cases , the Power Keyboard has a couple of key benefits: 1) You can attach and remove the Clicks Power Keyboard much more easily than a case, and 2) it allows the keyboard to be attach to any phone that has magnets, whether built into it or via a compatible case.",

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

The Better Value Plan has impressive perks that actually compare favorably with Experience More, for around the same price. While T-Mobile is still arguably the best value in the postpaid wireless market , the gap between it and its rivals has narrowed over the last few years as the Un-Carrier has increasingly mirrored competitors on pricing and overall value. Likely in an effort to push back against that perception, T-Mobile has announced a new value-focused plan it claims AT&amp;T and Verizon can’t compete with.

For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning.
