The chatbot can write essays, brainstorm ideas, and even generate code, making it an important resource that many now rely on. But what if it’s not working for you? For those unfortunate times when ChatGPT is down, we’ve put together a list of potential solutions you can try to get it running again. Check if ChatGPT is down Give ChatGPT some time to recover Check your internet connection Log out and log back in Try incognito mode or a different browser Use the ChatGPT smartphone app Clear your browser’s settings and cache Try a ChatGPT alternative Check if ChatGPT is down The first thing you should do is check if the servers hosting ChatGPT itself are down right now or facing connectivity issues. Such disruptions were common in the early days of the service, as the company struggled to meet the ever-increasing user demand.",

Other recent leaks suggest a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1.5K OLED screen. Motorola just rolled out the Edge 70 in global markets, but the company clearly isn’t slowing down. A new render shows what’s purported to be the first official image of the Motorola Edge 70 Ultra, hinting at where the next flagship is headed. The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70.

The “Clear Voice” feature has been renamed to “Auto Clear Voice,” and Google now notes that the feature uses more storage. A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings. Google is now rolling out Recorder v4.2.20251104 to users, introducing a few changes to the Clear Voice feature, as well as introducing the account switcher into the app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 could alleviate notification spam by blocking specific apps. As per a recent leak, One UI 8.5 may put apps with “excessive ad” spam into a state of “deep sleep.” It may also begin analyzing notifications on device to ensure they’re only blocked if they’re spam. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

If true, this would be the first wireless charging speed upgrade for the lineup since the Galaxy S20 series. Samsung’s flagships have long been criticized for their slow charging speeds, but there’s a sliver of hope on the horizon with the Galaxy S26 series. We’ve spotted branding for Super Fast Charging 3.0 , which aligns well with rumors of 60W PPS charging destined for the Galaxy S26 Ultra .

Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified .
