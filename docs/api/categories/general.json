The Luba 3 mower combines all-wheel drive with upgraded Tri-Fusion Navigation, including 360° LiDAR, dual-camera AI vision, and NetRTK for ±1 cm accuracy. The Spino S1 Pro pool cleaner features AutoShoreCharge, a robotic arm system that automatically lifts the unit out of the water and docks it for charging. Outdoor maintenance can be tough. Wrestling with a mower on a steep hill or pulling a heavy pool cleaner from the water makes the dream of a perfect yard feel like hard work. Mammotion wants to change that, and its CES 2026 showcase shows it’s almost there.

The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees. We’ve already seen the company increase its telco fees as recently as last April, but it looks like the company is doing it again. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
