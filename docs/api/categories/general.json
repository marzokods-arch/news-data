The best thing about Nano Banana is that it isn’t locked behind a paywall. It’s available in every country, across personal, work, and paid versions of Gemini, so just about anyone can try it out. Now, it seems Google is preparing to bring the magic of Nano Banana to an even wider audience by building it directly into Google Photos.

Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history.

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon says early 6G devices could arrive “as early as 2028.” Amon and others expect 6G to play a key role in a future where AI is deeply ingrained in daily life. We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

OnePlus is the only other brand to score more votes than Samsung die-hards who refuse to try other phones. Loyalty will only take you so far in life, and while we still value it enormously when it comes to personal and professional relationships, are you really doing yourself any favors by remaining ceaselessly loyal to a big, faceless smartphone conglomerate? Sure, if one manufacturer keeps knocking it out of the park, year after year, we’re definitely going to want to check out their latest offerings — but if that’s the only brand you pay attention to, you risk doing yourself a major disservice. Among companies making and selling Android phones, Samsung’s held a prominent spot for years, and to a distressingly large number of users, “Android” might as well be synonymous with “Galaxy.” But even with so many users turning to Samsung phones every time they’re shopping for a new handset, could we maybe convince some of you to see if the grass is any greener in another OEM’s pasture?",

But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

We previously reported that Google may be planning to merge Chrome OS and Android, unifying the two operating systems. This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect.

    "body": "As an Android fan, I’ve always been big on customization. I want the software on my device — no matter what it is — to feel as unique as I do. And, as a runner, I’ve always been big on Garmin GPS watches . Sure, I’ve explored a Coros here and a Galaxy Watch there, but I’ve always come back to the comfort and capabilities of what I know best. Along the way, I’ve learned a thing or two about my favorite wearable ecosystem. I’ve learned that there’s a right way and a wrong way to make a workout in Garmin Connect , and I’ve learned that if left unchecked, I could probably spend $100 on watch faces in Connect IQ. But, most importantly, I’ve learned that I have a favorite Garmin watch face — and even better, it’s a free one.",

    "summary": "The Eureka J15 Max Ultra is the brand's most powerful robot vacuum yet, and you can buy it now at a discount.",
    "body": "Remember when you had to pick up a stuck robot vacuum and clean the roller because of minor hair tangles? Those days of needing to frequently fix a stopped vacuum during cleaning have become a thing of the past, thanks to incredible advancements in technology. Today’s robot vacuums can run smoothly for months without needing any help. This rapid evolution is partly because brands like Eureka always push themselves to innovate, and certainly don’t believe in incremental updates between models. The J15 Pro Ultra is a wonderful robot vacuum and remains a top pick on our list of the best robot vacuums . But it’s truly overshadowed by the company’s latest and greatest – the Eureka J15 Max Ultra . With more suction power, smarter AI, better navigation, and enhanced cleaning features, the J15 Max Ultra definitely earns its moniker. Here’s everything you need to know.",
