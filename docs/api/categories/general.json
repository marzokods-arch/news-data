The latter debuted to mixed Steam reviews and muted sales when it carved its way into early access back in January, resulting in layoffs at Heart Machine and work on Hyper Light Breaker ceasing prematurely . But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

I'm also not alone—if we go by Steam reviews, almost everyone who plays this thing agrees. It's got a sterling 98% \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score for English reviews . Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked. Tactical Breach Wizards' agents all have really interesting, and powerful, suites of abilities—and by the time you get to its final missions, you're cleanly sweeping through its challenges without much trouble. Which isn't a deal-breaker, mind. As I put it: \"If the worst I can say is that I simply want more of Tactical Breach Wizards, that's a sign we've got something special on our hands.\" And hey!

In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts.

What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

You've collected every coin. Done every side quest. Spoken to every single NPC. S-ranked every level. Now, at last, the ultimate reward: an all-out fight against one final boss complete with an epic song that usually encapsulates your hours of hard work and your character's growth into some freakishly powerful being. For me, most of my exposure to boss themes growing up came through the endless stream of JRPGs I played. Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo. (Image credit: Eidos Montreal) I'll also forever adore the final battle in Kingdom Hearts 2, where Yoko Shimomura takes a far more stripped-back approach with gentle piano and vocals that almost feel like the antithesis of a big boss battle—eerily calm and unsettling all at once.

Two of these games are similar to the point where they could've been laid by the same hen.

Egg (subtitled 'Why not be an egg'?) is the new game from VVVVVV and Super Hexagon creator Terry Cavanagh. Available on Itch, it's a lo-fi, 3D puzzle platformer where you must guide a box of half-a-dozen eggs across a vertiginous, grassy cliffside searching for a lovely nest to, well, nestle in. The eggs navigate across the landscape by jumping. The longer you hold down the spacebar, the farther your chosen ovum will jump. If an egg falls off a platform, it breaks,…",

Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask. The moment-to-moment play looks more promising than the brief snippets shown in the original trailer.

The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth.

You'll certainly have less of it by the time you're done reading this review, and less still if you decide to pick up Hyperbeat: a rhythm game that roped me in with its oddball UI, low-poly dreamscapes, and atmospheric central hub full of NPCs eager to introspect with you. It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter). Every step you take in the hub world—a liminal space-and-bar called the Wellspri…",

The studio has been running an open beta for the last two and a half months, giving players curious about Greene's first proper game since PUBG: Battlegrounds the chance to try it out. That testing phase is rapidly approaching its end, however, as PP has announced its survival roguelike will arrive in early access on November 20. For the uninitiated, Prologue: Go Wayback is a deceptively simple game about hiking from a cabin in the woods to a distant weather tower, where each run is completely unique thanks to maps generated by the studio's homebrewed machine-learning technology. Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art. I remain sceptical about the functional benefits the ML tech brings, but it's a more nuanced use-case than a studio trying to replace human workers with ChatGPT or whatever. As for the game …",

Stadium's competitive format changed from best-of-seven to best-of-five, the structure that Stadium Quick Play has had and continues to have. But just two weeks into this update, and the devs have gone back to best-of-seven. (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) \"We are reverting the format of Ranked Stadium back to best of 7,\" the recent patch notes say. \"This is a direct result of both player feedback and internal data. Best of 7 provides players with more space to let their builds breathe and, of course, make those incredible comebacks. Thank you for all of the thoughtful feedback.\" The initial change was done as a bit of an experiment. The devs wanted to see if switching the structure up could solve complaints from players that, past round five, matches would snowball with powers and items becoming too strong for players to handle. And it did just that. Not only were Stadium games faster with the best-of-five format, but with less time for teams to purchase tonnes of expensive …",

Few properly achieve that, happy to focus on just one area while abstracting away others. But the grand strategy genre is always about expanding the view, incorporating into its wargame roots systems of politics, economics and culture. Europa Universalis 5 widens the frame again, adding a new wrinkle: People. It's nothing less than an attempt at simulating the world for centuries with a fidelity beyond anything else in the genre. You play as the controlling force behind a country over 500 years of history, 1337 to 1836, using the same mechanical simulation to present both the late medieval and the entirety of the early modern period. Political systems start with decentralized vassal feudalism, steppe hordes, and administrative empires but end with constitutional states and enlightenment monarchs.

I'm a sucker for replaying the games I love, but I often find NG+ modes can leave me feeling cold. I always want new story beats or remixed levels, like Dark Souls 2's devious black phantom mixups and upgraded bosses, but so often a NG+ run can feel flat, with retained gear and levels just trivializing the experience and removing any feeling of progression or reward. Labyrinth of the Demon King sounds like it's doing things right, tempting me to jump back into my second playthrough (where I learned from my mistakes and unlocked the game's best katana ) and punch through to the new stuff.
