Recently, some Galaxy Watch owners have noticed their sleep scores rising through the stratosphere. With no obvious behavioral changes to blame, this may be due to a change in the sleep score algorithm. Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of.

After all, the jury acquitted him on the central racketeering and sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The feds overreached and the jury slapped them down, the narrative goes — let’s get those White Parties going again. But the star was convicted, albeit on lesser charges of interstate prostitution. And these weren’t misdemeanors: Prosecutors want at least 11 years in prison, and the probation office says he deserves seven years. Combs&#8217; lawyers, on the other hand, want just 14 months — a sentence that would send him home almost immediately on time served. When Combs is sentenced by a federal judge on Friday (Oct. 3), how much time will he actually get? Legal experts told me that it will largely depend on one tricky question: How much the judge separates the “acquitted conduct” that was rejected by the jury from the actions on which Combs was actually convicted. That might seem like common sense, but it’s actually a controversial issue and the key dispute between Combs and prosecutors ahead of sentencing. Experts say it’s also a serious challenge for a federal judge: “I…",

I’ve been on Team Pixel for years, and when the Pixel 10 series launched, I jumped on the Pixel 10 Pro on day one. And honestly? I absolutely love it. It’s a phenomenal device that packs an incredible amount of power into a relatively compact and beautifully designed body. The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone. For many people, the premium features of a “Pro” moniker, especially the fancy camera tricks, are overkill for their daily needs. This is where the standard Google Pixel 10 comes in. It promises the core Pixel experience at a much more palatable price point.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority AT&amp;T handles its promotions differently from Verizon or T-Mobile. Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

    "body": "TL;DR Currently, when you search for an app on the Pixel Launcher, tapping the bottom-right keyboard button searches the app’s name on Google Search. Some users are seeing that keyboard button change to an arrow/open shortcut, allowing you to quickly open an app right from the keyboard. Google only appears to be testing this with a small number of users, with unclear plans for a wider rollout. The Pixel Launcher ‘s search bar is already one of its best features, allowing you to quickly perform a Google Search or find an app right from your home screen. According to some user reports, it appears that the latter functionality may soon receive a notable upgrade. As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it. If you tap the search button at the bottom right of your keyboard, the Pixel Launcher (annoyingly) searches for the app name on Google rather than opening it.",

While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future.

This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this.

It lets you cast Bluetooth audio to multiple connected audio devices — or listen to the same audio via different phones — simultaneously. Using this feature, up to 20 devices can connect to the same audio, which is excellent whether you want to share your music or watch a movie with a large group of friends. However, when you’re allowing other people to connect to your audio stream, you must either pair another pair of headphones manually or scan a QR code using another phone that’s already connected to those headphones. Now, that’s becoming a little easier as Google has added support for audio sharing through Fast Share.",

It is available now in China, with global release not yet confirmed. Credit: Boox For anyone after the distraction-free charm of E-Ink in a more portable package, Onyx Boox just announced the Note X5 Mini, a compact tablet that pairs a 7.8-inch E-Ink Carta 1300 display (300 ppi) with stylus support and a built-in DeepSeek AI assistant. Unlike the oversized Note Air 4 Pro and other productivity-heavy slates, the Mini is designed for mobility. It slips into a bag while still offering a paperlike display for reading, jotting notes, and sketching.",

OnePlus handsets have been among the better Android options for some time now, but the OnePlus 13 strikes a particularly special balance in its design, performance, cameras, and software. Because of that, you might think that I’m eagerly looking forward to OnePlus’s next flagship Android phone, the OnePlus 15. We’ve had tons of news about the OnePlus 15 over the last few days, and a lot of what we’ve heard sounds quite promising. But despite all of that, I still have this concern that the OnePlus 15 will lack what makes its predecessor so special. And if you love the OnePlus 13 like I do, I think you’ll find yourself in a similar boat.",

The feature appears to be similar to Apple’s approach, passively analyzing data to alert users of potential hypertension risk. The company is gearing up to launch a Fitbit hypertension study to advance research on the upcoming feature. Smartwatch makers have been attempting to integrate blood pressure monitoring technology into their watches for some time now. Several watches come with this feature, each employing a different approach to blood pressure monitoring, with their own pros and cons. Now, Google also wants to jump onto the bandwagon, as it could bring blood pressure notifications to the Pixel Watch.

It’s just too little at this point when system files and updates already block a sizeable chunk of it, and the remaining is taken up by the ever-ballooning app sizes — God knows what kind of data they are storing, because Excel has no business running into hundreds of MBs (or sometimes GBs). And did you see what a clown the newly launched Pixel 10 series looked like a clown when the iPhone 17 launched with a minimum of 256GB storage across the board? While Google does offer 256GB as base storage in a handful of markets, in most countries, including the US, the Pixel 10 still starts with 128GB of storage. And if you’re already stuck with the latter or cannot stretch the budget for a higher capacity, Google has a lifesaver built right into your Pixel phone.",
