    "body": "Galaxy Z Fold 4 Credit: Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is rumored to revive S Pen support for the Galaxy Fold. Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

Leaked information suggests that the rotary mechanism may adjust optically variable zoom levels and includes aesthetic cues, such as custom watermarks and red Leica engraving. Xiaomi is gearing up to launch the Xiaomi 17 Ultra flagship on December 25, promising great specifications for its top-of-the-line smartphone experience. The company just revealed the design of the phone this week, and it was admittedly disappointing to see the company shed its camera-centric aesthetic with the new phone.

Yesterday was Day 8, and the group put out another three-plus hours of livestream, continuing the tiring endeavor of folding and unfolding the phone repeatedly. And while my nonextant grasp of the Korean language prevents me from understanding the banter, watching them go on is definitely satisfying.

Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",

    "body": "Credit: Paul Jones / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus is rumored to be working on a new phone, codenamed Volkswagen, with a large 9,000mAh battery. The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, positioning it below the recently launched OnePlus 15R. We’re unsure if the said phone is the Nord 6, the OnePlus Turbo, or any other. With the earlier-than-usual unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, followed by the less powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, we’ve already seen Android flagships lining up for global launch. Although Samsung is expected to delay its announcement of the Galaxy S26 series , OnePlus’ flagship, the OnePlus 15 , is already up for sale in global markets. The brand also recently followed up with the launch of the OnePlus 15R , much sooner than the typical launch cycle. Now, with the spare time on its hands, OnePlus is working on less premium options, and one of them is already emerging in leaks and may launch soon. Per fresh leaks, OnePlus is gearing up to launch yet another phone set for global markets. Leaker Abhishek Yadav recently posted on X and Instagram Threads that a OnePlus phone codenamed “Volkswagen” is under development.",

In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity.

See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",
