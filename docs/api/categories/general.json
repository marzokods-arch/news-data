Many success stories for new names have played out over the past 12 months, signalling the dawn of the next generation of homegrown stars. Olivia Dean , Lola Young and Myles Smith consolidated their momentum on the global stage, while the likes of Skye Newman and Sienna Spiro proved that breakout buzz can scale quickly, each turning early releases into charting moments. That wave has continued to ripple outward. Newer musicians breaking through are driving conversation once again and building audiences on their own terms. You only have to look at some of the names in our list below to garner a sense of this cultural shift: rapper Kidwild, for one, has flourished as an independent act after a previous major label deal fell apart; Kwn , an R&amp;B star from London, is finally seeing the fruits of her labour after several years spent finding her feet as an artist.&nbsp; A renewed appetite for U.K. and Ireland voices across pop, rap, indie and beyond is certainly something to celebrate, especially as we look towards festival seaso…",

So, I started recording all the ideas that came to my mind in the hospital. I poured all that frustration and discomfort into my lyrics.” We are chatting in a private room at El Cilantrillo, Arcángel’s go-to Puerto Rican restaurant in Orlando, Fla., where he’s been living for five years. It’s been an ideal home base — far enough from Miami and Puerto Rico to grant him some anonymity, yet close enough to the buzz — for the renegade reggaetonero who’s become an icon of the genre despite his unapologetic and explicit lyrics; controversial tiraeras (diss tracks); and his vocal criticism of other artists from Héctor El Father to Polaco to Anuel AA.

The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

In addition, Philips Hue video doorbell and Secure camera will soon also support Apple Home. If you have multiple smart lights and mingle with their different color settings for the perfect mood lighting, Philips Hue has an update that will excite you. Signify, the company behind Philips lighting, has announced a new feature, called “SpatialAware,” at CES 2026 that will let you set different scenes by using multiple Philips Hue-compatible light sources together. You can use your phone’s camera to scan the various Philips Hue smart lights spread across any room. The app will create a spatial map of the different placements and automatically design lighting scenarios. In its announcement , Signify says that the feature aims to recreate lighting scenarios inspired by nature. It will automatically manage the colors and intensity of the light to create a harmonious blend.",
