However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Distributing your music as an independent artist can be tricky. Yes, you have outlets like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and even YouTube, but if you&#8217;re looking to move your work over to major platforms including Apple Music, Spotify or Tidal, it&#8217;s not as easy as hitting the upload button. To help distribute your music to an even wider audience, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about distributing your music as an independent artist. For signed artist, your label should take care of all this for you, but if you&#8217;re independent, to share your music on major streaming platforms you&#8217;ll have to go through a third-party distributor. With sites like DistroKid , the process to upload your music becomes a lot more simpler. The platform will handle most of the work for you, pushing tracks and albums to major streamers, automatically adding metadata and song credits to each platform, schedule release dates and upload as many track as you …",

Kicking down doors for female performers in both country and pop music, she has soared in the worlds of books, television, philanthropy and movies &#8212; and pretty much whatever else she tackled. On Jan. 19, Parton &#8211; who has topped the Billboard Hot 100 twice and Billboard &#8216;s Hot Country Songs a whopping 25 times &#8212; is turning 80 years old. Her expansive roster of hits reads like a “best of” list of the 1970s and 1980s, and it remains one of the strongest song catalogs of any singer-songwriter in any genre. As a writer, she has penned everything from poignant, detailed ballads about life in the Great Smoky Mountains, where she grew up, to some of the most defining love songs of all time. Her prowess as a songwriter and performer is so great, it earned her a historic induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022 &#8212; an accomplishment she almost didn&#8217;t accept, telling Billboard at the time that she didn&#8217;t feel like she &#8220;measured up&#8221; to past inductees.

Ed Sheeran , R3hab , Seeb, Shawn Mendes , Clean Bandit , Elvira , Bleachers , LP Giobbi and The Chainsmokers are among those tapped to turn Swift’s work into something new. Alternate versions of her tracks like “Everything Has Changed” from Red ; “Wildest Dreams” from 1989 ; “Delicate” from Reputation ; “You Need to Calm Down,” “Lover” and “Cruel Summer” all from Lover ; “willow” from evermore ; “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) ; “Anti-Hero” and “Lavender Haze” from Midnights ; “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from The Tortured Poets Department ; and “The Fate of Ophelia” from The Life of a Showgirl are perfect, whether your dance floor is at the club, in your living room or at a wedding reception.

As reported by 9to5Google , Visible has been sending texts to customers who temporarily lost service, apologizing for the outage and offering an account credit as “a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to” the MVNO. But while Verizon offered $20 account credits, Visible is only doling out a fraction of that, giving customers $5 toward their next bill.",

In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price.

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",
