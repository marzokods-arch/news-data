    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that Samsung might overhaul its Galaxy S26 series lineup. What especially caught my eye was evidence that Samsung was planning to launch a Galaxy S26 Pro in place of the expected Galaxy S26. The name alone suggested that we were looking at a more feature-packed base model. That would be a long-overdue move as the base Galaxy S flagship has always been small yet bereft of upgrades. Unfortunately, spec leaks point to anything but a Pro handset. Furthermore, a recent leak also suggests that the entry-level model will revert to the standard Galaxy S26 name rather than the Pro moniker.",

Thankfully, we know that Google is working to improve Android’s multitasking capabilities. The company is making big changes to the platform in preparation for Android-powered PCs , and these changes will benefit not only future Android PCs but also existing Android tablets. One such change Google has been exploring is the ability to launch any Android app in a floating bubble, taking a niche feature currently reserved for messaging apps and turning it into a powerful, general-purpose multitasking feature.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through.

Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line.

The phone also packs 100W wired fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and even 22.5W reverse wireless charging. It gets a triple 50MP camera array at the back, a Bose-tuned 2.1-channel speaker system, and a serious 6.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate — all under $600. Just as flagship phones are starting to roll out with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a new mid-range Android contender is here to steal the spotlight. Priced under $600, this fresh release isn’t exactly gunning for the Pixel A series in affordability, but wow, does it bring some heavyweight specs to the fight.",

Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR The new Pixel Camera 10.x update now requires Google Play Services, reportedly causing crashes on GrapheneOS and other de-Googled systems. Users can fix this by rolling back to version 9.9.106.773153235.19 of the app. Users on Reddit point out that if you’re running a sandboxed Google Play Store and Play Services on your Pixel with GrapheneOS, you’ll still be able to use the latest version of the Pixel Camera app. Google’s latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) apparently doesn’t play nice with privacy-focused operating systems. According to a report from Kuketz Blog , the new Pixel Camera app now has a hard dependency on Google Play Services. That means if you’re using GrapheneOS or another de-Googled system, the app will probably crash or fail to launch entirely.",
