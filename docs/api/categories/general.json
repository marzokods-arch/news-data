Even though we no longer need to plug soundcards into our gaming machines, the ability to output music that doesn't sound like a horde of angry wasps learning to play the kazoo in a sex toy factory is important in a world where games have actual composers working on them rather than expressing themselves through a series of bleeps the programmer made up. No disrespect to Jeff Minter there. Even having a basic pair of desktop speakers can elevate your gaming over hooking up to some earbuds via Bluetooth (or, heaven forbid, using the speakers built into your monitor). And the Creative Pebble Pro is most certainly a basic set of desktop speakers. You can get cheaper ones, sure, and you can definitely get more expensive ones. You can get ones with more bass and more inputs, but these cheap speakers from computer audio specialist Creative have got you covered for most game music and sound effects, and look pretty alongside your monitor too.

    "body": "One of Phasmophobia' s greatest successes is its lasting effect on the horror genre. Multiplayer horror has always had a foothold amongst the subgenres' finest, but after Phasmo's release five years ago, the scene has totally exploded with more horror games, both intense single-player experiences and wacky multiplayer romps. Part of this was certainly thanks to other factors, such as the pandemic keeping people inside, meaning that many were looking for new ways to hang out with friends, but it's safe to say that Phasmo's success spurred on the appetite for co-op games we've seen recently, like Lethal Company or REPO . (Image credit: Kinetic Games) You'd think that Phasmo's creator, Daniel Knight, would want to keep some of that success to himself, but that's just not the case. \"There's definitely some games out there that have taken a lot of inspiration from Phasmo,\" Knight tells me. \"But the reason why I made the game was because nothing like it existed, and I wanted to play that game. So now that there are all these other games out there, the same as Phasmo, it's just really good to see. Because at the time, there was nothing, now there's obviously quite a lot.\" Knight has said…",

The game was due out the following year. A year later and the game was not out, but Mitsoda and creative director Ka'ai Cluney were suddenly and shockingly fired. In 2021, Hardsuit lost the project entirely . In 2023, Paradox revealed it had given it over to The Chinese Room , which had dramatically overhauled the game in its own image. Today, we are six days away from that game's release, and hoi polloi like us still don't know any more about what went down with HSL's Bloodlines than we did several years ago.

Probably one of the closest updates for that is the player character coming out, basically reworking all the character models and all the animations. It's not very immersive at the moment.\" (Image credit: Kinetic Games) I would say that Phasmo is far more immersive now compared to what it was like on launch. But I do miss some of the bugs, like being able to hold doors shut to shield yourself from the angry ghost trying to catch you, or being able to climb onto the kitchen counters to hide from ghosts. But now Phasmo is going for more serious vibes, stripping all of the comedic bugs away.

See, if you take enough damage by bumping into walls/each other—or, uh, a meteor strike—you crash out, becoming uncontrollable as you throw a fit in your forklift and bump into goddamn everything. Which, to be fair, is a measured response to being hit by a rock from space.

It's job is to help simplify, improve compatibility for, and increase the capabilities of x86. Now, exactly one year on, AMD and Intel are letting us know the fruits of this perhaps peculiar collaboration. Those fruits, outlined by AMD , read a little like elvish to my weary eyes, but the general gist seems to be that there have been four big improvements made, in the form of new standards for upcoming Intel and AMD chips. Those four areas are the development of Advanced Matrix Extension (ACE), AVX10, Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED), and ChkTag. The latter two should improve CPU interrupt security and performance as well as memory safety. The last point is particularly relevant because Arm already has memory tagging for memory safety, so ChkTag will be x86 catching up in this regard. AVX10 will be the latest iteration of x86's AVX SIMD instructions, which should improve vector performance. Then there's ACE, about which AMD says: \"Accepted and implemented across the stack, ACE standardizes matrix multiplication capabilities, enabling seaml…",

And no, it's surprisingly not to do with the performance, as it's one of the only games in recent memory that actually runs really well . My gripe is much more odd: why is the sun so bloody bright? Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times, especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas. It's an issue almost everywhere, but it plagues maps like Operation Firestorm and Liberation Peak, where the contrast is even greater. Thankfully, I can put down my sunglasses, as there is actually a bandaid solution hidden in the game's menus. Simply head into the settings and look for the 'world brightness' option—you'll find it in the accessibility section when you first open settings, or at the top of the graphics tab.

Although every other mainline Splinter Cell game has been easy to pick up on PC digital storefronts for years, Pandora Tomorrow has always been strangely and sadly absent from the Ubi digital lineup. The corp wasn't just playing favourites—it wasn't available on Ubisoft Connect (née Uplay) either. That may be because Pandora Tomorrow's PC version was a bit busted (which is saying something for this series on PC: Double Agent will subject you to a gamut of errors and crashes if you dare try to run it).

For many players, WoW Legion Remix is an opportunity to collect achievements and cosmetics they previously missed—or the new ones Blizzard added on top. Many of them require completing raids and dungeons that take full groups, but finding parties has proven to be a problem in the early stage of the event. Weirdly enough, players are running into completely the opposite problem you'd expect if this was the regular version of WoW: Tanks, out of all three available roles, are the overwhelming majority. That's because, as you gain more and more gear upgrades, characters dedicated to healing or pure damage-dealing aren't really needed. Unfortunately, this leaves behind all the players who haven't had the time to grind themselves into godhood.

The game's community is so enthusiastic that modders are practically making entire games in the snowiest slice of Tamriel, and there's no sign they'll slow down any time soon. It's something that leaves Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith \"eternally shocked,\" as he told FRVR : \"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, ten. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?\" Speaking on the FRVR Podcast, Nesmith shared that Todd Howard would roll out the concurrent player numbers every now and again, to which Nesmith could only respond \"'You've got to be kidding me?

Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg, as I've just got my hands on the SCW-10 SMG.

Now, I'll admit, the SCW-10 might be the worst-looking gun at first sight, owing in large part to its very small frame, low precision stat, and measly 15 bullets in a magazine.

George W Bush is president, and the subprime mortgage market can only go up, up, up, baby! Wait, no, sorry. It is in fact 2025, but all those things I said about Serious Sam 2 remain, inexplicably, true. To mark SS2's 20th anniversary, Croteam returned to the game to give the whole thing some new polish and \"keep those Serious vibes alive for years to come!\" The changes are many, but the biggest is that Croteam has packed the SS2 Renovation Mod right into the base game. That's \"a global cosmetic mod to ensure the most comfortable Serious Sam 2 experience possible\", that does things like rework the interface to be closer to the Serious Sam Xbox version, tweak weapon visuals, and make \"enemies gib in a much more satisfying way\". Which, thank god. The new update has also split the game's controller and KBAM control menus out into their own separate fiefs, separating the bindings entirely. HUD icons have been redrawn in HD, fonts are better, movies play in full screen, and the default res is now 720p. In essence, Serious Sam 2 is now rea…",

    "body": "Psychological horror can be one of the hardest genres to get right. Developers either stumble and make a game that just seems too gimmicky to scare anyone, or they manage to hit the sweet spot and create something that's more than just terrifying—a horror game that'll stick with you. And from what I've seen so far, Eyes Out's latest game, Sleep Awake, does exactly that. My hands-on preview for Sleep Awake saw me enter the ever-shifting world of The Crush about midway through. The protagonist—Katja—had to make her way to a location, bypassing hordes of violent cultists to find the one person she cares about in this deteriorating world. (Image credit: Blumhouse Games) This was a stealth mission: Katja is navigating through broken apartments via rickety impromptu bridges, holes in walls, and decrepit elevators, all while making pit stops at almost every source of cover there is—that may just be my way of playing. The cultists don't have a particularly harsh line-of-sight—perhaps that's thanks to their ill-fitting gas masks—so if you're careful, keeping to the shadows and making use of all the cover there is, you can weave your way through them without many issues. But that doesn't me…",

    "body": "If you're in the market for a low-profile keyboard, you might have a few options in mind—the Asus ROG Falchion RX Low Profile , perhaps, or the NuPhy Air60 HE . But if you move a little off the beaten path, you'll find an absolutely superb board that ticks a bunch of boxes for gamers and typists alike. Enter the Lofree Flow 2 , which follows up on the original Flow. The latter stands as one of my favorite low-profile mechanical keyboards, so it's a tough act to follow. The Lofree Flow 2, however, has proved lightning can strike twice. One of the surprising aspects of the original Lofree Flow—considering how little-known the brand was at the time—was its undeniably high-quality construction. The good news is that you still get that premium feel and attention to detail in the Lofree Flow 2. If anything, it's been stepped up a notch. First, though, you'll need to choose from three size options: 100 keys (96%), 84 keys (75%), or 68 keys (65%). We reviewed the 84-key version, and it provides a comfortable balance of functionality and portability.

    "body": "With each iteration, Razer seems to take its Wolverine gaming controller to new heights. The V2 Pro was a step up over the original, while the V3 Pro repeated the trick, ending up as one of the best PC controllers money can buy. Now Razer has found a way to improve on near-perfection with the wordily named Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC . If you've got the cash for it as a PC gamer, it should be top of your list. Let's start with the build, which is sturdy and solid all over. The edge of each hand grip is coated in a dimpled, textured surface that helps it stay firmly lodged in the palm of even the sweatiest neckbeard. The durable construction should last you years of gaming, but Razer has included a robust carrying case in the box, just in case. To top it off, the controller's weight has been significantly reduced compared to the previous Wolverine V3 Pro, and it now sits at 220g, down from 304g—a 28% reduction. If you enjoy your fair share of marathon gaming sessions, you're not going to feel weighed down here. Almost every element of the Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC is decked out in a matte black finish, with a few gloss highlights thrown in for good measure. It feels classy in an understate…",
