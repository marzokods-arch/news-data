For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

In 2023, Asus took over the NUC product line and started creating mini PCs alongside Intel parts. Dropping the NUC name here is presumably a choice made due to the AMD CPU the GR70 is packing. Asus isn't dropping the NUC branding entirely, however, as the Intel-powered 2025 version of the ROG NUC , using the exact same chassis design, has been around since the summer.

Welcome to the Dark Place is a creepy single-player text adventure inspired by the likes of Zork and Kentucky Route Zero , which Zeekerss' has been working on for more than a decade. Speaking to GamesRadar , Zeekerss revealed why Welcome to the Dark Place had taken him so long to develop. Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained. This meant Zeekerss could implement his ideas very quickly. \"As soon as I think of something, it can be playable.\" But t…",

Most of REPO's existing critters are unsettling, especially the Upscream and the Animal, but there's nothing that really petrifies you. The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch. However, one of REPO's newest addition…",

Developer TVGS apologised for the unseasonal delay. \"Sorry this update is a couple of days late—I was originally planning on skipping the open beta and going straight to full release. At the last minute released [sic] I should probably play it safe and publicly beta test it for at least a day.\" A sensible decision, I reckon.

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked.

Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders.

Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million.

    "body": "Andrzej Sapkowski recently wrote a prequel to his Witcher novels, Crossroads of Ravens . At an event to publicize that novel, our colleagues at GamesRadar asked the author if he'd been involved in any part of the development of The Witcher 4. And he said, basically: nope. While explaining that the developers at CD Projekt Red did ask for advice and extra details about the setting while working on the previous games, these days apparently \"it's so rare\" that CDPR contact him to ask about the lore. Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth. The Witcher 4 is the start of a new trilogy of Witcher games, though since it only entered full production l…",

To win you'll have to build up a base of resources to keep a collection of valiant heroes fed and armed. Each time you build up a new kingdom you'll kick off with a choice of hero, like knight or priestess, as the core of your autobattling army. During the first days you'll build up a base of resources, like stone and wood, before using them to expand your production chains into the big stuff: meals. Every hero has a favorite meal to eat that lets them level up faster, a key to staying ahead of ever-escalating enemy forces. We first got a good look at Super Fantasy Kingdom a while back , and really got intrigued during the December 2024 PC Gaming show, when we saw the undead faction . The roguelike bits between waves are some of the most entertaining parts: As you explore the world beyond your little kingdom you unlock new heroes to recruit, 50-some in total, as well as small static bonuses and new buildings to diversify your economy.

You can load up modder Vriska's latest work in the Duskworld multiplayer mode if you'd like, but it was primarily designed for the game's wave survival mode. I tried out a few rounds for myself, and it's great. Dusk Gulch is a much smaller, more intimate affair than Blood Gulch, and I did some wiki research to make sure that wasn't just my middle school memories playing tricks on me. The scale makes sense for its intended purpose, and it even has fun-size versions of distinct map features like the high path on one side of the canyon, and the protected cave route on the other. The bases themselves are small fortifications with a jump pad in the center, and usually see weapon and ammo spawns depending on what wave you've reached. It's frantic, claustrophobic, and fun. Plus, it had been a minute since I'd actually loaded up Dusk at all, and I'd forgotten just how good it is. Dusk has proudly joined its inspirations, Half-Life and Quake, in the ranks of …",

These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely.

It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession.
