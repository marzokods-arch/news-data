    "body": "Britney Spears shared a pointed message on social media over the weekend, criticizing her family after they appeared to celebrate Christmas together without her. On Sunday (Dec. 28), Spears posted a message to Instagram alongside a photo of a decorated Christmas tree, using sarcasm to address what she described as long-standing hurt tied to her family relationships. “Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can’t fix,” Spears wrote. “To my dear sweet innocent family… so so sorry I was busy this Christmas but I will definitely show up and surprise you soon.” The post appeared to be in response to a festive photo shared earlier in the week by her younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, which showed Jamie Lynn celebrating the holiday with her husband Jamie Watson, daughters Maddie, 17, and Ivey, 7, as well as their mother Lynne Spears and Britney’s son Sean Preston Federline. In a separate line within the same post, Spears directly referenced her niece Ivey, writing, “Hello, beautiful Ivey… I just want to hold you, my love… Godspeed, friends.” According to P…",

For what it’s worth, the TriFold is only being produced in small numbers and is only sold in a few markets. Samsung is reportedly struggling with Galaxy S26 series pricing as well. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is perhaps the most interesting Galaxy phone of the last few years, featuring a dual-folding design that differs from the trailblazing HUAWEI Mate XT . Samsung’s device isn’t cheap at ~$2,440 in Korea, but it sounds like the company might not be making a profit. Korean news outlet The Bell reports that the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold reportedly has a higher production cost than its selling price.

The duo is set to launch in China on January 8 and may be exclusive to the market. However, they are rumored to launch globally under the Nord series. OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

I am personally at a point where I wouldn’t side-eye anyone for picking one over the other for whatever reason. The year 2025 has been fantastic for the Android world — there have been so many great phones launched this year that you could go over each one of them, drooling. The newly launched OnePlus 15 comes with such a massive battery (with super-fast charging!) that you could run it for two days straight without topping up in the middle. The Pixels double down on their AI game, and there seems no looking back at this point.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR A lot of users are complaining that they don’t see the option to make their Google Photos 2025 recap. Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

    "body": "Galaxy Z Fold 4 Credit: Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is rumored to revive S Pen support for the Galaxy Fold. Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

The order prevents new drones and components from being authorized for sale in the US, though it does not affect already sold or certified models. The biggest loser in this appears to be DJI, the Chinese drone and action camera company that occupies the largest share of the US drone market. The long-anticipated ban on Chinese-made drones in the US has finally been enforced, with the US recently clearing the way to ensure that only drones assembled in the country “dominate” its airspace. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently issued a new order that places drones manufactured in countries outside the US on a “Covered list,” which comprises products that “pose an unacceptable risk to national security.” Besides drones, the order basically includes anything with wireless radios.",

Samsung just took home our Reader’s Choice award for the best phone of 2025 with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but will it be able to repeat that success next year? Even with Samsung’s launches still a couple months away, some of us have already been souring on the idea of the Galaxy S26 lineup , worried that Samsung’s gotten too complacent, and isn’t doing enough to keep things feeling fresh. Those concerns extend to the phones’ cameras, but even if we don’t get a big upgrade to camera hardware, we’re still spotting a few improvements on the horizon for Samsung’s camera software.
