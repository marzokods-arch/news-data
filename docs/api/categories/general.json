This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick). Instead, I'm suggesting you take a gander at Printables user jq910's wares and 3D print yourself an RTX 5090 FE PCB Drink Coaster (via Videocardz ). Even if you don't already own a 3D printer, I bet this one is a cheaper craft than cracking open a two-grand card. All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files. However, jq910 writes that they chose to omit the power connector \"because it would get in the way of larger cups and also make the coaster annoying to stack.\" As such, jq910's representation of the PCB is somewhat simplified, and also much flatter than the…",

So it's lovely to discover that Mechanicus 2 is shaping up to be even bigger and better. Playing the free demo currently available on Steam, I'm really impressed with how the core strategy has evolved. (Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away. As Harvey pointed out in his Mechanicus 2 …",

For instance, original Halo designer Jaime Griesemer was vocally disappointed with the new remake , calling it out for mucking with the level design in a way he reckoned was deleterious for the game as a whole. Well, buckle up, because yet another Halo OG has entered the ring and this one's a lot more positive. Marcus Lehto, art director on Halo 1, 2 and 3 and \" father of Master Chief ,\" took to X to declare that he's a fair bit keener on the remake than his former compatriots. \"It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this,\" says the man himself. \"My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this,\" wrote Lehto, \"I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001.\" Which is quite the stamp of approval from the original game's art director, I suppose, …",

Unfortunately, I can't do that in real life, but I can do it in the ridiculously morish clicker game Scritchy Scratchy . (Image credit: Lunch Money Games) I admit I was quite disappointed when I first booted up the game. I had expected to go right into the scratchers, but instead I'm forced to pick up a spaghetti-coated plate and scrub it clean for a few pennies. Scratchcard money doesn't make itself, I suppose. Once I'd washed a few dishes—and broken some, a light introduction to Scritchy Scratchy's luck system—I was finally bestowed my first scratchcard. A simple little thing with three boxes, and all I have to do is match two of 'em. I either win something or I win nothing.…",

    "body": "Fraser Brown, Online Editor (Image credit: Future) Last week I hopped from Bloodlines 2 to The Outer Worlds 2, mainlining RPG sequels. This week I've been regretting my decision. I am a man on a mission—a mission to roleplay. My craving for quality RPGs never subsides. I finish one, and then I'm off on a new quest, to find another. But like so many RPG protagonists before me, I'm also cursed. Specifically, I live with the curse of having played too many great RPGs, which means that even a perfectly fine one just doesn't cut the mustard. For a week now, I have been trying to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 . I tried to shed all my expectations and just go with the flow, to immerse myself in the off-kilter sci-fi universe that Obsidian has created. But folks, I simply cannot get into it. And this time I can't blame its proximity to Disco Elysium. (Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment) See, when the first game came out, I made the mistake of hopping in right after I'd just finished Disco Elysium . Most games would have suffered after that; Disco Elysium has become my all-time favourite RPG. But The Outer Worlds felt particularly conservative, relying on surface quirkiness to make up for its…",

When PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter gave the game a spin, he conceded he thought the game was an elaborate bit at first. It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG.

Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing. I think we, in two or three meetings, wrote down, like, three pages of ideas, and it's 'Okay, we need to get this game out quickly, and it needs to be done so it's sold in the US market before Christmas, because we need the money [or] else we cannot pay people.'\" That didn't curb the team's ambitions, mind you. Players had already tinkered with EU1—wherein you selected from a small batch of scenarios, each with a designated playable nation—to make any country accessible from the get. The mod maker behind that feature, named Henrik Fåhraeus, was hired as content designer for the sequel, which aimed to have every country playable in the base game; today, Fåhraeus is Paradox's chief creative officer. \"So, that's a good hire.

Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase.
