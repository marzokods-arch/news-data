I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009. Meanwhile, Dark Ties—a bonus Gaiden game releasing with Kiwami 3 that has you play Yakuza 3 villain Yoshitaka Mine—acts as the wholly new red meat to draw in those of you who already know Okinawa like the back of your hand. (Image credit: Sega) But don't let me undersell it: Kiwami 3 looks absolutely gorgeous and plays wonderfully. It just, you know, does those things much in the same way Kiwami 2 did.

It's set in an isometric city covered in rust and filth, is intensely detailed with surreal art, and sticks all its dialogue on the right side of the screen. However, the Disco Elysium comparisons don't seem to apply to protagonist Hershel Wilk, who appears to be a relapsed spy called back in to assemble a squad. I don't think that you'll be waking up hungover and naked in your hotel room at the start of Zero Parades. Hershel, the two off-screen characters in the State of Play trailer explain, hasn't been around for five years, but is still considered one of the best. That doesn't mean she won't get into trouble. There's a scene where she's being interrogated while strapped to a chair and getting up to some hijinks around the city wearing a rectangular mascot's jiggly head. I can only imagine it's to pass a tough skill check. There are a few glimpses of familiar systems from Disco Elysium, like a black and white detective vision for piecing together bits of evidence and a menu screen of ongoing tasks in the form of playing cards.

There's no mention of Xbox or PC versions in the trailer, but we've confirmed separately that Deus Ex Remastered will also come to both platforms. On PC, it'll be available on Steam, and there's a store page up now. As beloved as Deus Ex is on PC, I wonder if this will be bigger news for the console crowd. Deus Ex is a PC classic through and through, and as such, fans have kept the original fresh themselves with mods. GOG will supply you with fan overhaul Deus Ex: Revision , for instance. The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?) In a press release, Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal also noted a few quality of life additions: Deus Ex Remastered will include \"autosaves, faster loading, achievement tracking, and cloud saves on supported pla…",

This is, I kid you not, just a partial list from Steam: (Image credit: Starbreeze (via Steam)) It's a massive collection that would cost hundreds of dollars to purchase in total—not an issue if you've been playing for years and slowly amassing the stuff, but an awfully heavy load for newer players. That's where the Payday 2 subscription option comes in: For $5 per month, you get \"full access to all available Payday DLCs.\" You can subscribe and cancel as you like—any progress earned in DLC content will be maintained even if you cancel your sub, so you can pick up where you left off if you resubscribe in the future—and all content will remain available for individual purchase as it's always been. \"With more than a decade of content behind Payday 2, we want to give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game,\" Starbreeze's head of …",

FiveM enables the use of custom cars, maps, and weapons among other content, but crucially also allows for a much bigger player count in online games. Together, these capabilities made it a key piece of software for GTA Online's roleplay (RP) community. At the time, fans hoped this heralded a bright new era for GTA RP. Then it all went quiet. But finally we're starting to see the fruits of that acquisition, and Rockstar itself is helping to promote it. \"Nopixel V is the next evolution of the GTAV Roleplay experience, created in collaboration with Rockstar Games,\" said the X announcement . \"Coming soon to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms—stay tuned for more information at nopixel.net .\" \"We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP,\" said Rockstar , retweeting the above. What exactly Rockstar's support means is left ambiguous, but having nopixel V running through the Rockstar launcher feels huge.

The town looks much more vibrant, which really helps you appreciate the quality of the graphics. It also strips away any eeriness and actually makes it look like a lovely, normal town that I'd love to visit, as long as none of the monsters are still lurking around. It's a fun mod to see out so soon, but in all honesty, I don't think there's much need to tone down the fog for those who aren't just interested in sightseeing—you can see everything you need to with it there just fine.

The way they've been awarded has changed over time, and the game's added additional cosmetics like graffiti, but these gun skins are the bedrock of a vast marketplace, the true size of which is unknown. And yeah: the ones you get just for playing can look nice, but generally hold little value, while the finishes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars are almost exclusively found in weapon crates (unlocked with a case key that costs $2.50).

    "body": "Nioh 3 , the next installment in Team Ninja's brilliant soulslike series, seems to have had its release date spilled by Amazon Japan, as spotted by Gematsu . Thanks for the slip up, Amazon. We already knew that Nioh 3 would be getting a simultaneous release on PC and PS5, so no more waiting around for us this time, but now we know when to expect it: February 6, 2026, which fits the \"early 2026\" window we were given previously. Before Amazon corrected its mistake, the release date could be seen on the listings for both the standard and Treasure Box editions, along with the first reveal of the PS5 box art. Sony's next State of Play airs during the Tokyo Game Show today, which seems like a more appropriate place to announce the release date, so it seems like Amazon Japan just jumped the gun. I'm pretty excited for this one. Nioh 2 is up there with the best of FromSoftware's fare, but like the greatest soulslikes, it's not content to simply ape a competitor's games. The varied weapon stances, ki system, transformations and randomised loot sets it apart, and, frankly, it's considerably trickier. The setting has always been a draw, too, melding fantasy, mythology and historical twists t…",

As a matter of fact, there's nothing wrong with having multiple clear inspirations, smushing them together into a glossy frankengame, and then sticking anime bunny girls in 'em. As is the case with Ananta , which released a meaty seven-minute gameplay trailer recently. It's the first major effort by Chinese dev Naked Rain and published by NetEase—a self-described \"free-spirited open-world RPG\" that seems like it'll be one of them free-to-play gachas trying to corner another bit of the market. And if you watch the trailer above, you'll see the Spider-Man influence clear as day in some eerily familiar ledge-perching and swinging. And the Sifu-esque, Batman: Arkham-style, Yakuza-ish combat. And the GTA vehicle handling. There's even a little Watch Dogs-y drone tossed in there, too. Honestly? I'm here for it.

If you are at that point (and also plan on moving to China), Maxsun has you sorted. If not, well, it's still quite a pretty design all things considered. As spotted by VideoCardz , Maxsun has announced the GeForce RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA Plus S0 . This is very similar to the RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA , which it launched earlier this year. Both have three fans, and both GPUs have the same imagery spinning on those fans. Where the older model has a blue and white tint to said imagery, the newer one combines a grey and pink. However, spin that GPU around and you will spot a big change. On the back of this RTX 5070 card sits an anime cat girl with blue hair, a top hat, and a waistcoat. This gives her a magician's look. The previous card also has a cat girl, but a hole in the rear plate of the GPU gets in the way of the image, which means the new card will get you a smidge more cat girl, should you care a lot about cat girl economics. Speaking of cat girl economics, though you may demand it, the supply of this card is solely within China, so yo…",

Since this is a \"walking simulator\" and this logic applies to real life too, it may seem overly obvious. And it might be. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I know I'm not alone in that. Baby Steps is played from a third-person perspective and it lets you change whether the camera is oriented to the left or right of Nate. But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up. The physics in Baby Steps are detailed and fun to mess with, but even when you're just walking along seemingly safe surfaces, a simple obscurely placed rock can send you tumbling. It's fine to fall—sometimes in Baby Steps you have to fall—but…",

Fortunately there was a dry path beside the mud, and unfortunately I found a single rock on that path, tripped, hit the mudslide, and slid to the bottom of it.
