Those who hopped on board with Fallout 3 tend to rather like Bethesda's take: sure, it's not doing much of enormous narrative ambition, but it's fun to explore the great rambling wastelands the studio gins up for its game. Decrepit grognards (me), meanwhile, get misty-eyed thinking about how awesome Fallout 1's pulpy, morally dubious take on the post-apocalypse was. And we will literally never shut the hell up about New Vegas . So colour me surprised that when The Vile Eye asked OG Fallout co-creator Tim Cain about things he'd love to see in one of the games (via GamesRadar ), Cain's answer was unequivocal: \"The one thing I always wished was in a Fallout game was an actual good faction. Like 100% good.\" Cain has a pretty clear idea of what \"100% good\" means, saying that they'd spend their time \"growing food and making shelters and looking for old tech and maybe looking for old medicine, and they're really trying to help people.\" As to why he wants to see this, it's not (just) because he's an old softy, but because he thinks it'd be interesting to see how players approached them. In particular, Cain wants to explore how…",

It's well, imminent: Hades 2 hits 1.0 this September 25, or 13 days from now. It'll hit Switch at the same time, should you want to play it there. You might actually want to, by the way, because one of the bells and whistles Supergiant's bringing to the game on the 25th is cross-saves. \"In v1.0, Hades II offers cross saves between the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam. If you've been playing in early access and wish to continue the journey on Nintendo's game consoles, you'll be able to transfer your save data through a simple in-game menu,\" quoth the announcement post . If you're staring slack-jawed at the headline, swearing up and down that Hades 2 was already out, I don't blame you. The game's been in early access for over a year now, and was already good enough that our Harvey Randall made it his personal GOTY pick for last year.

If you hadn't clocked it, this all involves the Green Prince—a mysterious grasshopper (he might be a cricket…) you can rescue in Sinner's Road. Visiting Verdania is related to his overall journey. Obviously, this guide will contain some spoilers for the Act 3 main quest (as far as having to progress it to reach Verdania is concerned), so leave now if you're not there yet. Otherwise, here's how to unlock Verdania as an area and help the Green Prince. How to unlock Verdania in Silksong As mentioned above, you can't get to Verdania until you're in Act 3 , and even then, you'll have to jump through some hoops first.

That's now moved to an as-yet-unspecified Thursday in March 2026, a target Mega Crit says it's \"confident [it] can hit.\" The only real reason for the delay?

However, this change has always made navigation that much more complicated, as we're not restricted by closed-off locales and predictable corridors anymore. Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display . This isn't quite the minimap of old, which would give you the exact layout of the area, but it will help you track the exact location of enemies in combat relative to your own position.

You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Post-launch patches solve most of the issues in time, but stutters, hitches, and relatively low frame rates are the norm for the series, so my expectations for Borderlands 4's launch performance weren't very high. And sure enough, it needs work. I've tested Borderlands 4 on two gaming PCs: one that just meets the minimum system requirements ( Core i7 9700K , Radeon RX 5700 XT , 16 GB DDR4-3200) and one that's a top–end gaming rig ( Ryzen 7 9800X3D , GeForce RTX 5090 , 32 GB DDR5-6000). Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .

However, I'll also discuss whether we can expect this to increase in the future. What is the max level in Borderlands 4? The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds. There are a few key features related to your progression: You'll start encountering loot drops with Firmware as early as level 25 (these are effectively gear sets). Once you've completed the main campaign, you'll unlock the Sp…",

As the Forgeknight, the best Amon builds use a variety of elemental weapons, from hammers, axes, and swords, to shields and even drones to get up in enemies' faces before pulverising them. With arguably the most complex action skills and trait of all the Borderlands 4 characters (it's certainly more hands-on than Rafa 's, for example), Amon could prove challenging to wrap your head around at first. Fear not, though, as I'll go over three of the best Amon builds at max level below, covering the skills, augments, and capstones to pick, alongside what gear works with them. Best Amon builds in Borderlands 4 Like the other Vault Hunters, Amon has three distinct skill trees to pick from: Calamity : This tree has one goal in mind, and that's to become the iconic Doom Slayer. Run around with faster movement speed and rocket-punch enemies into dust. Obviously, there's a big focus on melee damage and action skill use in this tree, though there's also a lot of potential for hybrid builds using close-range weapons.

But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips.

Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz.

    "body": "Puzzling out how to unlock Act 3 in Hollow Knight: Silksong is a tricky business. If you're trying to do it yourself, you'll likely have seen that you need to acquire a special quest from the Caretaker at Songclave, but it's not entirely clear what the exact unlock conditions are for it. Some say you have to do every quest or find every lost flea, but I'm here to get rid of any misconceptions. Since I didn't do loads of side content, it wasn't actually too hard to pin down the unlock conditions for the Silk and Soul quest you need to complete to open up Act 3. Below, I'll go through the exact requirements, what you need to do after, plus I'll provide a list of other quests I did and my reasoning as to why they likely don't matter, just in case there's an outlier you need to complete for Silk and Soul. How to unlock Act 3 in Silksong (Image credit: Team Cherry) Before I go into specifics, I first want to clarify some misconceptions I've seen about unlocking Act 3: You don't have to do all quests You don't have to find every lost flea You don't have to do every town quest (though almost all of them) You don't have to beat the final boss to acquire the Silk and Soul quest Now that's …",

    "body": "If you've played any of the previous games, then it should come as no surprise that Borderlands 4 loves its cosmetics. There are plenty of costumes, heads, and colours for you to earn for each of the four characters , and you can even customise your little Echo-4 drone. In fact, the Borderlands 4 Twitch Drops campaign gives you just that for free, as well as legendary guns. Below, I'll go over the Twitch Drops reward and how you can get it, so you're not missing out on the true Borderlands 4 endgame—fashion, and guns, of course. Even better is that you've got plenty of time to earn them, so don't worry if you get caught up in the grind at launch and it's hard to pull yourself away.

    "body": "I tend to approach robot videos with a mild air of defeat and scepticism, in no small part because a lot of hype has been generated over what has turned out to be just choreographed movements in the past. Not here, though. This little HITTER (HumanoId Table TEnnis Robot) is hitting bona fide table tennis rallies against humans. And yes, that's table tennis, not ping pong; I'm right, you're wrong. Alright, alright, we'll go with 'ping pong'. HITTER, the ping pong-playing robot, comes from researchers at the FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at UC Berkeley . In a recent video (via Techeblog ), it's shown forehanding, backhanding, and smashing ping pong balls with impressive dexterity and, dare I say it, human- like movement. What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements. In particular, as someone who used to play a lot of table tennis and who wasn't awful at it, I was genuinely impressed by how HITTER returns smashes, and also with the return at 0:28 right off the edge of the table. The robot achieves all this thanks to its design which \"employs a hierarchical decomposition …",
