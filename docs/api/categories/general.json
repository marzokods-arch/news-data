    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Leaks have revealed that Samsung is working on a Privacy Display feature, but it has been unclear whether the feature will be a Galaxy S26 Ultra exclusive. A new leak reveals that a Privacy Display card does appear in the Tips app for the Galaxy S26 Plus. The card appears to include the same animations and descriptive text as the one found on the spoofed S26 Ultra. When you’re out in public, the last thing you want is for nosy strangers to be looking at what you’re doing on your phone. Last year, we spotted code within a leaked build of One UI 8.5 that suggested Samsung was working on a solution for this problem, called Privacy Display. There have since been plenty of leaks suggesting that this will be a Galaxy S26 Ultra feature. But what about the other models in the series? A new leak may have revealed the answer to that question. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The rated battery capacity for the upcoming midsize flagship matches that of its predecessor, and Samsung is still using a lithium-ion battery. The wired charging speed is unchanged, too, with the Galaxy S26 Plus certified to support 45W over a cable. A new year means new Samsung Galaxy phones aren’t far away, and the upcoming Galaxy S26 series is rumored to launch as soon as next month. As we get closer to the expected launch window for the Samsung Galaxy S26 models, regulatory and third-party certifications clarify specifications about the devices ahead of their official unveiling. Now, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus has been spotted by The Tech Outlook on the TUV database. The certification reveals the exact battery capacity and charging speed for the upcoming midsize Galaxy phone. The unnamed Samsung phone spotted on the TUV certification database is identified with the model number SM-S947B/DS, which previous leaks revealed is the model number of the Galaxy S26 Plus .

    "body": "Credit: Ice Universe on Weibo TL;DR Apple is rumored to have exhausted its in-house options for a crease-less display for its upcoming iPhone Fold. According to a rumor, Apple might have torn apart the OPPO Find N5 to determine what makes the screen bulge so little. Apple is also rumored to be using a Samsung-made display for its upcoming iPhone Fold. It’s no secret that Apple is heavily invested in launching its first folding iPhone soon. It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands. Based on a rumor shared by a Weibo account with the username “Fixed-focus digital cameras ,” Apple tore apart an OPPO Find N5 while trying to decode what enables the screen’s crease to be so minimal.",

The Find N6 is expected to be a powerhouse with a 200MP primary camera, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and a 6,000mAh battery. The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete. Samsung won’t be the only Android brand launching two book-style foldables this year, as it appears even OPPO will join the party with its own wide foldable.

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

A new Request to Jam button has been added to chats, making it easier to coordinate and start remote shared listening sessions. The features are rolling out to iOS and Android users in markets where Messages is enabled. Group chat support is planned for the near future. Spotify rolled out a Messages feature in August last year, and today, the company is expanding its functionality with Listening Activity and Request to Jam. Listening activity is an opt-in feature that allows Spotify users to display the music they’re currently listening to within Spotify Messages in real-time. If you’re not actively listening, your most recently played song will be displayed instead.",

Every year, alongside the headline-grabbing TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, there are products that don’t always get the same attention but still shape everyday life. Pool care is one of them. For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

Portable charging cases aren’t a novel idea (brands like RingConn and Samsung already offer their own), but this launch closes a noticeable gap in Oura’s accessory lineup.",
