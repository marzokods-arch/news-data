The Netflix disdain was expressed in an investors Q&A earlier this week, when a caller asked if the WBD acquisition would \"enhance or accelerate\" Netflix's gaming ambitions, which have floundered after a hard-charging start: Netflix has closed or sold off the studios it made such a big point of having just a few years previously, and it's biggest idea these days seems to be laying out huge amounts of money for generative AI . Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though.

Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right,\" the blog reads. \"To be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.

While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm.

    "body": "While the February 27 release of Resident Evil Requiem is just a couple months away, we've only learned a few scraps of information about its plot, premise, and characters since its Summer Game Fest reveal. This week, that's changed ahead of schedule, thanks to Sony leaking details about Requiem's cast via the PlayStation store (via IGN ). Earlier today, players who've purchased non-deluxe edition digital copies of Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation store and checked for preload details were suddenly treated to updated cover art for the game. And that updated art just so happens to prominently feature our beautiful, spin-kicking son, Leon S. Kennedy. Here's a look: (Image credit: Capcom) Leon's potential inclusion in Requiem has been the subject of speculation since before its first reveal showed the blasted remains of his old Raccoon City stomping grounds—thanks in part to known RE leaker Dusk Golem , who's claimed that Leon is \"not the only playable character, but he is the main character.\" Until now, Capcom has remained thoroughly insistent that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, even as early demos left some of us—like PC Gamer's Morgan Park —with the distinct…",

Apparently it has not—yes, I checked—but it has, as PC Gamer wordsmith Joshua Wolens put it in September, reached \"unprecedented levels of leaked.\" Yet somehow, it now is even more leaked. The latest leakage comes by way of PEGI , the Pan European Game Information agency, which has helpfully provided an 18 rating for something called Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced. There's little more to be gleaned from the rating at this point, except that the game has violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. (Image credit: PEGI) I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment, because as far as I know it has continued to steadfastly refuse that any of this is happening. And while I typically cast such requests into the ether with no real hope that my existence will even be acknowledged, much less responded to, in this case I feel like maybe Ubisoft is ready to throw up its hands and finally cop to the whole thing.

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more.

It's a proprietary rather than open standard. What really marks this drive out from, say, the even smaller microSD format is the combination of performance and full NVMe 1.4 support. The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s.

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix.

    "body": "Minecraft has answered the prayers of anyone looking for a longer-reach melee weapon rather than relying on the bow. That's right, the spear is here courtesy of the Mounts of Mayhem drop, and don't let its simplicity fool you—there's a lot to love about this little weapon. Working out how to craft a spear is incredibly easy, depending on which material you want to use for it, but it can be a little tricky to master its moveset. It packs a serious punch within its attacks, and requires a little more training than just swinging a sword around. Here's everything you need to know about how to create one and how you can make the most of its moves. How to craft a spear in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) To craft a spear in Minecraft, you need two sticks and your chosen material. Place one stick in the bottom left corner, one in the middle row and center square, plus your material in the top right corner. It's essential that these materials are placed diagonally, since if you place them vertically, you'll end up with a shovel which won't do much damage to your enemies. Much like every other tool in Minecraft, there are various different forms for you to choose from, but since wood is th…",

    "body": "Minecraft 's Mounts of Mayhem drop introduced the Nautilus to the game; an underwater mount that whips you around under the waves much faster than swimming. If you've been waiting for an excuse to finally explore underwater, then finding a Nautilus might be your key to success. But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one . Fortunately, they tend to spawn in groups of two or three, so if you find one, the chances you'll encounter a few extra to tame are high too. As is the way with all of Minecraft's underwater mobs, th…",

I've been deep in the mines spelunking for rare minerals, and have plenty of tips for where to start your search. Where to find Stone in The Forge You'll find Stone by mining Pebbles in The Cave. It also drops from bigger rock nodes deeper in the mines, but I found it easier to go for the smaller targets up front, away from the dangerous enemies lurking further in. Here's the step-by-step on what that process looks like: In Stonewake's Cross (the first area), head southeast and enter The Cave Equip your Pickaxe and look for Pebbles in the entrance area (near Umut) Hold left click to chip away at Pebbles, keep at it until you find Stone Image 1 of 2 It's a tiny notification, but you can see what mineral you've mined at the bottom of the screen.
