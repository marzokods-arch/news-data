The found camera, a SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic, was discovered with a shattered lens but an intact casing; while the memory card inside was also intact, the data appeared to be encrypted or otherwise inaccessible, as Manley explained in the above thread. Working with the Canadian Transportation Safety Board and camera manufacturer SubC, the investigators in the pictured report were able to recover nine videos and 12 images. However, as the US NTSB report notes, none of the images were from \"the accident dive.\" In fac…",

That's not exactly a smoking gun, given that Del Rey has an album coming out and this could be an unrelated song that just happens to have the same name. But come on, Lana Del Rey would be a perfect fit for a Bond theme of the smoky Nancy Sinatra variety. I reckon she could manage a brassier Shirley Bassey-type song too. And it would be justice for the fact she wrote a theme for Spectre that ultimately went unused in favor of Sam Smith's song, Writing's On the Wall. (The song Del Rey wrote for it was eventually released under the name 24 , Spectre being the 24th Bond movie.) After seeing 30 minutes of 007 First Light gameplay , our Tyler Wilde came away surprised by how impressive the shooting was. While there's gunplay in IO Interactive's Hitman games, it's never been the main attraction—if you end up going loud it's usually because something's gone wrong.

Developer Renegade Kid originally pitched it to Konami as a Silent Hill game. As director Jools Watsham told NintendoLife , \"The person I met with from Konami was rather dismissive and said something to the effect of, 'We wouldn’t give the Silent Hill IP to a team like yours'. It was quite surprising and very disheartening.\" Renegade Kid tried again years later, using the engine from Dementium 2 to mock up a third-person game to pitch to Konami. \"Konami's response that time wasn't dismissive like the first time,\" Watsham told IGN . \"They simply didn't want to venture into the DS space with a horror title at that time.\" The trailer sure makes Dementium look a lot more like Doom 3 than Silent Hill 2, so I can't say I'm disappointed Renegade Kid had to come up with their own mythos rather than borrowing Silent…",

If you long for the simpler times back when enemies just smoked you and got it over with, you might take a shine to Classicvania and Zelda-inspired adventure game Mina the Hollower , the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games. Speaking with Knowledge, Yacht Club co-founder Sean Velasco highlighted the game's simple control setup intended to \"take something old and rejig it,\" as reported by GamesRadar . \"There are limitations, but the limitations are what provide the fun,\" Velasco told Knowledge. \"Every game has a parry now.

This week I've been: trying to unlock every weapon in Battlefield 6 before Season 1. It's been almost four years since the last Battlefield game, 2042, and nearly a decade since the last truly great one. The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map. As a series veteran, I think it's safe to say that none of these maps are particularly large, and I do hope we get more diversity going forward.

Now, Necesse is not done, exactly, but feature-complete as far as Fair Games' main plans for it went. The 1.0 update introduces multiple significant changes to its fantasy world, the biggest of which is, well, the world. Up to this point, Necesse's world was built from a limited scattering of islands. But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out. Handily, Necesse supports migrating your existing world to the new generation format, though the developers encourage players to start a new game to experience the world afresh. Elsewhere, the 1.0 update overhauls Necesse's balance and progressio…",

The additions deepened character relationships and made you feel more attached to the setting. By contrast, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth took the original's second act and bloated it into 50+ hours of open world RPG filler. It wasn't just the optional tower-climbing and chocobo-stealthing stuff that made Rebirth feel stretched. Even if you stuck to the critical-path story you'd have to slog through Cait Sith throwing boxes around, an overlong final dungeon, and a plot you had to move through at a crawl—sometimes literally. Screenrant recently spoke to Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, and brought up some of these complaints. \"Regarding time management in certain sections,\" he replied, \"especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary.

    "body": "Turtle WoW—a fanmade, souped-up take on World of Warcraft Classic with new character customization options and zones—is like a lot of MMO private servers in that it took years of work across a dozen modding disciplines to make it a reality. Unfortunately, it became so successful that it caught the attention of the original game's developer, as evidenced by the copyright infringement lawsuit Blizzard filed last month. When that suit was filed, the team behind the private server issued a statement: \"Turtle WoW is here to stay.\" Yesterday, October 17, they issued another: An open letter to Blizzard itself, requesting a licensing framework for fan mods and private servers. The letter, which you can find in full on the front page of the Turtle WoW website, gets into the history and arguable inevitability of fanmade mods. \"Many successful games have a modding community. It is a part of gaming culture and a testament to the game's quality, and the community's passion,\" The Turtle WoW team argues. \"The World of Warcraft modding community is flourishing, and as more tools become available, it will only continue to grow.

But this solution didn't go far enough, at least according to MGS 5 modder mohtalgear. And to celebrate the sequel's tenth anniversary, they decided to do something about it, resulting in the Definitive Subsistence Update . The Definitive Subsistence Update aims to be the equivalent of the Substance and Subsistence updates for MGS 2 and 3. \"Definitive Subsistence adds new content and new meaningful gameplay mechanics that'll make you feel like you're playing MGSV for the first time,\" mohtalgear says in its Nexus Mods description.

The studio has worked minor miracles with handheld ports too, most notably the Nintendo Switch version of 2020's Doom Eternal . That said, The Dark Ages was the first Doom game to be fully and constantly ray-traced, making it a less obvious candidate for handheld gaming when it launched. While it ran well enough on most PC hardware and could even deliver reasonable framerates on a cheap gaming laptop, as Andy Edser noted in his PC performance analysis , the Steam Deck nonetheless struggled to meet its minimum requirements, and as such performance was underwhelming. But that's all changed, apparently. Update 2.2 introduces several handheld-centric optimisations and quality-of-life features.

As a house, you roll around this island at sometimes ridiculous speeds, chatting with different buildings and going on dates with them. I saw Building Relationships at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show on Saturday. It's a funny game but, crucially, it's not just funny because you're a building. It's also funny in the same way Baby Steps is: there's something inherently comical about the moment-to-moment movement, the bonkers physics, and the sense that you're always in control but only just. When the seductive protagonist does find a date—perhaps with a charismatic windmill, or a friendly manor, or a \"himbo\" tent—the process proceeds as a mini-game. For example, as my house dined with a grand old abode, I had to put together a flat-pack table for my romantic interest to eat (because buildings eat furniture, obviously).

Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

    "body": "Sometimes, it's hard to get overly excited about a new bit of PC gaming kit. Take the gaming routers , for example. We all use them (and yes, I know it's technically more than just a router—there's a switch and a wireless access point in the box, too), but they just sit on a shelf somewhere or on the floor, getting poked by bored cats. They just do their thing and we rarely give them a moment's thought, until they ruin a Steam download, of course. I felt very much the same way until I recently reviewed three new devices from TP-Link: two mesh systems, the Deco BE68 and Deco BE25 BE5000 , and the Archer BE9700 . Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router. Heck, you can't even buy a brand-new, semi-decent graphics card for that amount of money. As someone who's only ever used the router s…",

    "body": "PayPal's blockchain partner, Paxos, looks to have made something of a maths-related whoopsie earlier this week, as it mistakenly minted $300 trillion worth of its stablecoin, PYUSD . That figure might look massive in its own right, but it's even more impressive when you take into account that it's more than double the world's GDP—which is currently estimated to be around $111 trillion , based on figures from 2024. The error was spotted by eagle-eyed market watchers on Etherscan, a block explorer and analytics platform, and was said to be fixed within 20 minutes (via CNBC ). The company released a statement on X confirming the erroneous minting of coins, describing it as an internal technical error. \"There is no security breach,\" the post continues. \"Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause.\" What that root cause was, we may never know. I like to imagine it might have been someone dropping a sandwich on their keyboard, because that's often how my mistakes are made. Still, a commenter in the thread below has theorised that it may have been a result of forgetting to account for six decimal places, which is my kinda maths screw up.

    "summary": "Expensive, and one of the best handheld gaming PCs, but c'mon, Microsoft, this is no Xbox.",
    "body": "The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is a handheld gaming PC that is filled with, and fills me with, contradictions. 'This is an Xbox,' cries Microsoft of what is patently just a PC. 'This is the best handheld gaming PC I've ever used,' I cry of a device that I could not in good conscience recommend anyone with budgetary constraints should buy. Such is the folly of the redesigned and rebadged Asus ROG Ally X . A handheld gaming PC that goes a long way to ironing out many of the kinks inherent in Windows-based devices, but does so with what I believe is a fundamental misunderstanding of why people buy handhelds in the first place. At its heart, it's a new version of the Asus handheld, but with a new AMD APU inside and a reskinned, reimagined version of Windows on top. And both are improvements over what's gone before. But Microsoft, having ditched its own plans for an in-house handheld, has slapped an Xbox badge on it and is now asking gamers to pay far more than they have for any Xbox console that has ever existed. This is the Xbox Ally X: An Xbox that isn't, and a handheld PC that's kinda got it right, but also kinda wrong. Asus ROG Xbox Ally X - our verdict (Image credit: Future) Valve's St…",
