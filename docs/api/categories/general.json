Lainey texted us and I legitimately had to pull over to the side of the road and I was just sobbing. It was very special. It was bigger than I dreamed—and I got a deer that weekend, too, so it was pretty much the best weekend, ever.” Anderson has co-written nearly a dozen songs that have populated Lainey’s two CMA album of the year-winners Bell Bottom Country and Whirlwind , including the Country Airplay No. 1 “Somewhere Over Laredo” and top 5 hits “Heart Like a Truck,” and “Wildflowers and Wild Horses.” Cole Swindell, Gabby Barrett, Madeline Edwards and Nate Smith have also recorded her songs.
