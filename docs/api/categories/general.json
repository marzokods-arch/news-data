That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm. It comes with two 120 mm fans installed at the front, below the ro…",

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

Out of nowhere it will appear on his doorstep with no warning and he has no choice but to use whatever it is like his life depends on it. Because it does. Returning home one evening after a night of revelry, I discovered a mysterious Amazon box on my doorstep I had no memory of ordering. No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody. Actually, I shouldn't be so quick to judge. Pulling the mic from its default cardboard packaging reveals a surprisingly weighty little chassis, and that's a promising start. I've had the privilege of working with some roadworthy audio equipment over the years, and the little Amazon Basics mic has the same sort of heft I'd usually associate with something gig-proof, like a Shure SM58 or SM57.

A Redditor who goes by the handle ashleysaidwhat has apparently attached a pair of trucks to an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5080 . The result is a seemingly workable skateboard, of sorts. \"She's a 5080 Astral but she looks like a 5090, and she handles like a TUF,\" is all the poster has to say. The rest is Reddit history and presumably a future podcast series. Was the RTX 5080 already bricked? Hopefully. Is it now completely toast as an actual GPU? Almost certainly. Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket. Likewise, the PCIe connector with all the electrical contact points isn't visible and, as you can see from the official Asus image below, it sticks out quite a lot in reality.

Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\".

Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.

Now that one is green and the other blue like God intended that's no longer an issue. (It was enough of an annoyance there was even a now-redundant Encyclopedia Colored mod .) The update also changes the way the retry option works: \"Retry no longer causes resources gained in previous run to be lost\". I still won't bother with it because I like going back to my base between runs to send the workers pinballing across the fields harvesting resources, even if I don't particularly need any wheat at the m…",

Now the developer says the employees were fired for violating company policy by sharing confidential information in a public forum. You might imagine a conspiracy to reveal secrets about the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 to the press or public, but the Independent Workers of Great Britain union says the employees in question were just speaking with labor organizers in a private Discord group. Rockstar and parent company Take-Two did not immediately explain the cause of the firings after the news broke last week , initially saying only that the employees were guilty of \"gross misconduct.\" In a statement sent to Bloomberg this week, the developer elaborated, saying that the workers had been \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" The IWGB, however, says that the only Rockstar outsiders the employees were speaking to were labor organizers.

Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it .

But Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser recently revealed in an interview with Lex Fridman that Grand Theft Auto 4 took some unexpected inspiration from his own personal life. \"I had been living in New York for a few years, and wasn't sure if I was happy,\" Houser says. \"I was going through a lot of personal drama, as usual. I was looking at some of GTA 4 again recently, and it's really dark, and I was like, 'Ah, that's why.' I was single and miserable, and I wasn't sure I wanted to stay in America.\" All good reasons to end up writing a dark yet brilliant script for GTA 4. \"My life felt in a lot of flux,\" Houser continues. \"As a company, we had all that Hot Coffee drama, so we constantly thought we may be shut down in the middle of making [GTA 4].\" If you're not aware, the Hot Coffee drama that Houser is referring to spawned from a mini-game in GTA: San Andreas. Found by a team of hackers, it let players have sex with CJ's girlfriend after prompting \"movement\" commands. This may not seem like a huge deal now, but it was quite the controversy at the time, as the game was pulled from shelves…",

    "body": "Rockstar's co-founder and writer, Dan Houser, has led a… uh, colourful life—moving to New York in 1998, he'd go on to help create what is now one of the biggest game development studios and companies in the entire industry. But it turns out that the impetus for Houser to get his butt to the big apple was, pretty fittingly, something out of a Grand Theft Auto sequence. That's per an interview Houser had with Lex Fridman , which you can also find below. Houser says that, circa '98, \"my life was a mess. I was in South America, in Colombia, when there was a war waging there. I was making a series of very poor life choices, and the lack of life skills aged 25—my latest poor choice was to get up too early.\" Colombia during the '90s was, to risk an understatement, not exactly the best place to be , which is something Houser discovered first-hand: \"The police didn't start work 'till nine but the muggers started at eight. I was out walking along the beach at eight.\" He recalls speaking with someone on the beach before \"two guys came to talk to him, and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him, if he owed the money, or if he'd bought me to them. \"One of them had a machete and one of t…",
