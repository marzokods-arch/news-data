Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency.

The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free.

The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.)

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

That means you can jab SpongeBob right in his (presumably porous) eyeballs with regularity, which sounds like a fun evening in with the family. They're also available to customise as part of the Xbox Design Lab suite, so you can... I don't know, make them look like SpongeBob has a terrible illness? The Elite version seems to be going that way by default, as the outer grips look to be an odd mix of textured black plastic and bile green stamping. Anyway, there's a new SpongeBob movie on its way, apparently, and now you too can buy into the marketing campaign. Which might be a little hard on your pocketbook, because they…",

    "body": "As of early November, Dragon's Dogma 2, Capcom's ogre-stabbing RPG, has hit a new sales milestone, with the company celebrating four million copies shifted . For a niche RPG with a hefty price tag, that's quite the win. That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side. Despite its poor technical performance, however, I absolutely loved my monster-slaying holiday, giving it 89% in my Dragon's Dogma 2 review . I'll happily put up with a lower fps when I'm climbing up dragons to stab them in the eye or riding ogres like bucking broncos. For others, though, the performance issues were a lot m…",

But after spending time exploring Wishblossom Ranch and meeting its inhabitants, there's an absolutely unfathomable amount of childlike joy tucked in its story which I haven't experienced since I was first welcomed to Dreamlight Valley. Although it follows the same process of meeting new characters who need your help, completing their quests to unlock them as friends, and clearing up any chaos caused by some force linked to your trauma, Wishblossom Ranch is unlike any of the expansions Disney Dreamlight Valley has released. Each biome you explore is so different from one another, yet the quests that link them and the relationships between the characters you meet pulls them together in an incredibly neat package. The excitement I felt to get to the next area constantly drove me to keep playing, even after hitting a roadblock such as needing to level up which would usually be enough to make me call it a night.

Well, it was actually created by Roman 'der8auer' Hartung , in conjunction with Jon Sandström of ElmorLabs , to make it easier for them to test motherboards, CPUs, coolers, etc. And since he just so happens to be the CEO of Thermal Grizzly, it's now something that I can use for the same purposes, too. For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing. When I get a new motherboard or CPU to review, I use a basic open-chassis to mount the motherboard and PSU, then wire it all up, and then spend a good amount of time installing the operating system and …",

With that 20th anniversary in mind, developer ArenaNet has announced the most substantial overhaul in the game's history: December 3 will see the launch of Guild Wars Reforged , a visual and gameplay overhaul for the venerable monster-bothering quest-em-up. Reforged is co-developed by ArenaNet and new studio 2weeks, which is largely composed of former ArenaNet staff, and bills itself as a modernised version of the game and its (many) expansions. The visuals have had an HD overhaul, performance has been tweaked, the UI has been reworked, there's a new (optional) objective guide, and Reforged also boasts proper controller support and Steam Deck optimisation. The overhaul will be free for existing owners of the game, but will also lower the price point to $20 for the game's complete package for anyone who wants to dive in fresh.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together. Essentially, the system—currently on the Midnight Beta—allows you to make outfits that can, at the drop of a hat (and chestpiece, and trousers, and boots), be thrown over your existing gear without having to bleed gold every time you get a new purple.
