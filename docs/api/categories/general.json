However, contributing to the conversation is an entirely different beast. Duolingo sprinkles speaking exercises into its lessons, but the functionality feels more like a smaller piece of the puzzle rather than the focus. Speak , another language learning app that I’ve been watching from afar over the last few years, turns this strategy on its head, and the difference has been eye-opening to me.

Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution).

The rollout begins with newer Lifestudio models and will expand across the entire lineup in 2026. As projectors strive to close the gap with TVs, bigger screens and better brightness are no longer enough; software matters too. Today at CES 2026 , Epson announced that select Lifestudio projectors will soon integrate Google TV with Gemini, bringing Google’s more conversational AI assistant to the brand’s big-screen lineup. Gemini has been quietly expanding across Google’s ecosystem, and the company already announced that Gemini is coming to projectors . Projectors are finally getting software that doesn’t feel like a compromise compared to modern TVs.",

The poster-sized frames are designed to function as fully cordless wall art, with up to a year of battery life. Color E-Ink isn’t just for E-Ink tablets anymore, and wall art is one of the more logical places it’s showing up. The tech offers the flexibility of digital art without the glow, noise, or constant power draw of a traditional screen. After launching its first consumer-friendly color ePaper art poster in 2025, InkPoster returns to CES 2026 with two new A1-size frames that scale the idea up in a big way.

Key specs include a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 SoC, a 108MP primary camera, IP66 water resistance, and a 5,520mAh battery, all packed into this slim chassis. With phones set to become more expensive this year due to the RAM crisis, an increasing number of consumers are expected to turn to mid-range Android phones . It also makes sense, as these phones can serve most people’s needs just fine at a fraction of the price of flagship phones. Xiaomi is gearing up to meet these needs with the launch of the Redmi Note 15 series, starting with the base model, the Redmi Note 15 5G.",
