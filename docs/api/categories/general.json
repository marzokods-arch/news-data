    "body": "If you've just bought a new ultrawide monitor or invested in a top-end headset for some serious VR action, one of the graphics settings you've probably tried changing in games is the field of view. What you've also probably noticed is that opening up the view to make things more immersive just ruins the visual experience. The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

Rockstar announced yesterday that GTA 6 was getting delayed again , and is now scheduled for November 19, which seems like an eternity away. As you can imagine, GTA 6 fans have been reacting really normally to this news. No, I'm serious, after the last delay, it seems like everyone went through all the stages of grief and has reached acceptance , or near enough: \"Nothing wrong with delaying a game. Nothing at all. But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…?

But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

Miyamoto never said it but, hell, the truth is the truth. As frustrating as it can be to have something you're looking forward to punted back, we'd all rather a game be good and late than bad and on time. Perhaps no studio has had this lesson drilled into it (kind of; its game didn't end up being 'bad forever') like CD Projekt Red. Cyberpunk 2077 is, now, an excellent game—worthy of inclusion on our list of the top 100 games you can play right now, no less. At launch? Less so . Now, the studio has extended a little social media backing to Rockstar over yesterday's delay to Grand Theft Auto 6 . One of the many venues in which Rockstar announced GTA 6's delay to November next year was X (the everything app!). As you can imagine, the announcement attracted tens of thousands of replies ranging from disappointment to anger to jokes to expressions of support. One of the supportive replies was from the official Cyberpunk account , which said nothing except to quote one of its own tweets—from October 2020 (two months before CP2…",

Studio founder Nels Anderson was previously the lead designer of masterful stealth game Mark of the Ninja before co-founding Campo Santo to make Firewatch. Generation Exile's team also includes Karla Zimonja, designer on Gone Home and Tacoma, and Niamh Fitzgerald, lead designer of hit traffic sim Mini Motorways .

Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play.

That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.
