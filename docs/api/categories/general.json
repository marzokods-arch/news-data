    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code for a new feature that will let users delete all their contributed incident reports. The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Update: January 22, 2026 (3:08 AM ET): We’ve since been in direct contact with the affected user, who has shared documentation with us. We’ve reviewed the local fire department report, which confirms a thermal runaway event, as well as written communication showing Samsung has offered compensation covering the phone, medical expenses, cleanup costs, and a separate pain-and-suffering amount. This confirms that the incident did occur as described and that Samsung has made the compensation offer outlined in the original Reddit post. We’ve also reached out to Samsung US for a comment on the matter.",

Ninajirachi (real name: Nina Wilson) has come off a freakishly fruitful awards season in which almost everything she was nominated for, turned to glory. Consider, in the space of several months, she collected multiple ARIA Awards, J Awards, the Australian Music Prize and the NSW Music Prize for breakthrough artist, all off the back of her debut album, I Love My Computer . And just this week, she added second prize in the 2025 Vanda &amp; Young Global Songwriting Competition for “iPod Touch.” “I just had a little break over New Year and had a chance to think about it.

That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month.

His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning.

    "body": "Credit: Unihertz TL;DR Unihertz, a company that already sells rugged QWERTY phones, is teasing its next phone with a physical keyboard. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite features a more compact and sleeker design, much like the recently revealed Communicator from Clicks. Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

    "body": "Credit: Paul Jones / Android Authority TL;DR The upcoming OPPO Find X9 Ultra was spotted with a unique 300mm telephoto lens extender accessory. Previously leaked specs suggest the device will feature high-end cameras: a 200MP “super large” primary camera, a 200MP “mid-telephoto” camera, and a 50MP 10x periscope zoom camera The phone is expected to debut in China and globally in March, marking an unusual international push from OPPO’s ultra tier. If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.

Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels. Contrary to yesterday’s leak, though, this one claims that the visible Dynamic Island cutout will stay in the middle of the display.",

If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead.

You can ask about existing events and create new ones on your secondary calendars. This is great for anyone with work, school, or family calendars. You can also change your default calendar to create events on, but the settings is hidden. It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",

The phone is also expected to feature Samsung’s Exynos 1680, a 50MP Sony primary camera, 45W charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. Samsung is on course to launch its flagship Galaxy S26 series later in February. Even before that mega event, though, Samsung could refresh its mid-range A series with noteworthy improvements to the cameras and the overall design. While the Galaxy A07 5G was unveiled last week , the A37 and A57 now appear ready for an official highlight in the coming weeks. Out of the two, the Galaxy A57 is already breaking cover with a fresh listing on TENAA , China’s telecom certification body. While some of the Galaxy A57’s specifications had already leaked, the listing also divulges a breadth of additional information, including its dimensions, display, battery, and more.",

In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version.

That was a fantastic start, but there was still a long way to go in terms of expanding compatibility. Earlier this month we saw Google’s efforts begin to bring the upgrade to Pixel 9 phones in Android Canary , and that’s work the company has continued with its more recent Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 release. But as more users give QPR3 Beta 2 a try, we’re discovering some unexpected Quick Share problems. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

An existing notification that alerts users their ring is disconnected will be updated to include the battery charge percentage at the time of disconnection. Code for these changes is present in the Galaxy Ring Manager app, but we’re not sure when to expect the changes to go live. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring uses notifications on your phone to keep you up to speed about its battery and connectivity — for example, alerts when battery charge gets down to 15 percent or when connection with the ring has been lost. Today, we’ve seen evidence that those notifications will soon be a little smarter, ideally helping users avoid missing out on tracked health data.

Pricing has yet to be revealed, but this is billed as a premium ‘endgame’ handheld. AYANEO held its first product sharing session of the year this morning, and it finally gave us a look at one of the most anticipated small gaming handhelds this year. The Pocket S Mini, which was first teased in September 2025, brings the ultra-premium all-metal design of the Pocket S series down to a size that actually fits in your pocket. The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

Samsung is gearing up to launch a barely upgraded Galaxy S26 series in the coming weeks, hoping to take on the iPhone 17 series with renewed vigor. While Samsung mostly stagnates even on its Plus and Ultra flagships and might do so for yet another generation, Apple is preparing for another big change with the iPhone 18 Pro series and is finally entering the foldable market with the iPhone Fold , likely in September.
