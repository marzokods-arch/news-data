    "body": "World of Warcraft 's player housing early access is already a treat—with players immediately setting to work constructing all kinds of madcap, HOA-violating nonsense , as they very much should be. One trick players discovered (outside of being able to sit anywhere ) was the ability to send their entire homes skyward. This was a UI bug—turns out that with the \"move\" widget on a lot of homes, there was a hidden vertical arrow that could still be clicked on. You could also fiddle around with moving another object vertically to trick the game into thinking this was the case (you can see YouTuber DiscordianKitty doing so here). Which has, naturally, led to some banger creations. Like this Howl's Moving Castle-esque mecha strider by user Frofidor on the WoW subreddit: Once I knew how to lift the house into the air, I knew I had to give it legs. from r/wow Per a post by community manager Kaivax on the official WoW forums, the dev team made a rapid pivot to decide that, actually, this wasn't a bug—it was a feature: \"Almost immediately after the 11.2.7 patch went live, we saw players using keybinds to elevate houses off the ground, even though there weren’t UI controls for that.

Gonzalez began by going into some detail on the elements he admired in the show's writing, before things took a rather more interesting turn. \"I really enjoyed the first season of the show,\" says Gonzalez. \"I thought there was some really admirable complexity in the way that they explored the world. I mean, I thought that the Maximus character is a fascinating creation, a fascinating slant to take you into the Brotherhood of Steel. I'm fascinated to see where it goes.\" Gonzalez then makes the dangerous decision to mention the topic of credit and residuals, comparing it to how many early comic book creators were treated: the likes of Bill Finger or Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. \"It is very odd to see characters that I created showing up in other media,\" says Gonzalez. \"It's also something where there's no credit for that, there's no residuals for that.

These are all the powers we know she can steal so far: Thor's awakening state Doctor Strange's shield Groot's walls Emma Frost's diamond state One of Phoenix's attacks Iron Fist's healing Psylocke's invisibility Invisible Woman's projectile punches Loki's healing lamps It's a hell of a roster of powers to choose from, but unfortunately, you won't be able to use all of these in one match, well, not unless the enemy team keeps changing heroes to include one of these characters.

Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom.

Conquer objectives faster by picking up every quest you can (Image credit: FireAtacck / Roblox) Tons of quests in The Forge share overlapping objectives, and if there's a limit on how many you can have at once, I've yet to encounter it. Make your life easier by speaking to every NPC you can and accept whatever tasks they have for you. Most are easy and a nice introduction to the basics—like learning how to mine Stone —while others require quite a bit of grinding.

The Netflix disdain was expressed in an investors Q&A earlier this week, when a caller asked if the WBD acquisition would \"enhance or accelerate\" Netflix's gaming ambitions, which have floundered after a hard-charging start: Netflix has closed or sold off the studios it made such a big point of having just a few years previously, and it's biggest idea these days seems to be laying out huge amounts of money for generative AI . Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though.

Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental.

It's a proprietary rather than open standard. What really marks this drive out from, say, the even smaller microSD format is the combination of performance and full NVMe 1.4 support. The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s. For the record, the read IOPS are 550K, the writes 650K. Those are pretty comparable to figures you'd expect from a full M.2 drive with the same two-lane PCIe 4.0 interface.

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix.
