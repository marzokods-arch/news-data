Instead of having the usual PvE experience that holiday events often have, Haunted Masquerade is simply putting a new spin on 6v6. \"We want to explore something a bit broader, in the sense of, like, team selection,\" associate game director, Alec Dawson, says. \"You know, how is my team benefiting me? What did they give me? And seeing how the players will react to that in particular. \"I would say it is more of an examination on team synergy and team selection, rather than how things like perks and mods in Stadium, which are very much focused on how you want to upgrade your specific hero.\" There are 11 pairings in Haunted Masquerade. You have Hanzo and Genji combining Dragons, Brigitte and Reinhardt meshing shields and then other hero combos like: Orisa and Sojourn Ramattra and Zenyatta Roadhog and Junkrat Winston and Tracer Mei and Juno Reaper and Moira Soldier 76 and Ana Symmetra and Lifeweaver Torbjorn and Mercy \"I think the first thought…",

But I gotta admit, this new Kickstarter-funded eGPU dock based on Thunderbolt 5 is incredibly slick and has enough features that you could almost view the eGPU bit as an extra. The Humbird 3 , as it is known, claims to be the world's first eGPU dock with Thunderbolt 5 support. That's critical, because Thunderbolt 5 offers 80 Gbps bi-directional bandwidth plus a 120 Gbps one-way \"Boost\" mode, the latter being designed to support multiple really high-res and high-refresh displays. So, the first question is, will Thunderbolt 5 and 80 Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth be enough to keep a modern GPU fed? After all, if it is, you could then turn any laptop with a Thunderbolt 5 port into a gaming machine. Er, right? That's actually a tricky question. The problem with eGPUs isn't just pure bandwidth; it's latency, too. The Humbird 3 has a full PCIe x16 slot for graphics cards, but it can't do the full x16 bandwidth by PCIe Gen 4 standards, let alone Gen 5. The 80 Gbps of Thunderbolt 5 basically means you're looking at a PCIe x…",

Well, imagine how scandalised I was when I learnt that not only do people prefer to play these sorts of games that way, but that contingent is sizeable enough to alter Obsidian's thinking when it comes to The Outer Worlds 2 . Chatting to Game Informer , game director Brandon Adler says a desire from fans made the studio revise its plans to stay strictly first-person. \"About halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it,\" said Adler. That puts third-person in rare company. Adler says that, for many of the ideas that devs wanted to implement, the studio stayed strikingly sober: \"You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one.'\" Obsidian did not, in fact, make the game's third-person sicko mode itself…",

Its cinematic take on World War II, and especially the Omaha Beach landing, earned it our Best Action Game of the Year award, and made it one of 2002's must-play games. The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing. Or, to put it another way, \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" as Zampella recently told GQ Magazine . It's an incredible own-goal in the history of video…",

I haven't decided yet if that's because they're totally overpowered or if I'm just a dummy, but what I do know is that \"land mine spam\" is real. The current best practice for anti-tank mines, as far as I can tell, is to plaster absolutely every road, junction, and pile of dirt with cylindrical death traps and hope that drivers are too distracted to look out for them. It's working so far: Whether I'm driver, gunner, or a humble passenger, at least half of my tank and jeep escapades have ended with the sudden and frankly terrifying boom of a land mine.

There's the slow progression, the wonky server browser, the high CPU usage, and oh yea—there's something deeply wrong with hit registration. If your gun isn't always shooting straight, that's partly by design—Battlefield 6 guns have \"bloom,\" an accuracy penalty that increases bullet spread the longer you fire continuously. While some Call of Duty transplants are gobsmacked by the mechanic on principle, DICE is currently investigating instances where bloom is working a little too well. As no shortage of clips shared over the weekend reveal, sometimes guns just decide to be inaccurate at extremely close range , or at the beginning of a magazine when they should still be accurate. But there's a good chance that we're talking about multiple bugs disrupting accuracy, and it's probably not all bloom's fault.

But watching someone do that in an animated series? For 20 minutes at a time? It's hard to imagine that being gripping, which is probably why the stealth sequences in Netflix's animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch don't last all that long before transitioning into straight action.

    "body": "Aggro Crab, the developer of hit co-op game Peak and arbiter of \"friendslop\" (although we're still undecided on that phrase here at PC Gamer), have released a demo for its new game for Steam Next Fest —and it's already utter chaos. Though it's of a different flavour. Crashout Crew sees you and up to three other mates tasked with delivering a specific number of items into the back of trucks before they haul off without their precious cargo. Which sounds simple enough, except this workplace is the furthest thing from OSHA-compliant it can possibly be. It's OSHA- hostile . See, if you take enough damage by bumping into walls/each other—or, uh, a meteor strike—you crash out, becoming uncontrollable as you throw a fit in your forklift and bump into goddamn everything. Which, to be fair, is a measured response to being hit by a rock from space. Whereas Peak is a battle of attrition, slowly trying not to let poor choices ruin your day, Crashout Crew is a delicate plate-spinning operation that's been factory-designed to come apart at a moment's notice. You'll start off doing comms-clearing callouts and barking \"behind!\" like you're on The Bear. But all verbal communication skills melt awa…",

    "body": "A year ago today Intel and AMD teamed up to defend x86 , establishing an advisory group called the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group (EAG). It's job is to help simplify, improve compatibility for, and increase the capabilities of x86. Now, exactly one year on, AMD and Intel are letting us know the fruits of this perhaps peculiar collaboration. Those fruits, outlined by AMD , read a little like elvish to my weary eyes, but the general gist seems to be that there have been four big improvements made, in the form of new standards for upcoming Intel and AMD chips. Those four areas are the development of Advanced Matrix Extension (ACE), AVX10, Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED), and ChkTag. The latter two should improve CPU interrupt security and performance as well as memory safety. The last point is particularly relevant because Arm already has memory tagging for memory safety, so ChkTag will be x86 catching up in this regard. AVX10 will be the latest iteration of x86's AVX SIMD instructions, which should improve vector performance. Then there's ACE, about which AMD says: \"Accepted and implemented across the stack, ACE standardizes matrix multiplication capabilities, enabling seaml…",

    "body": "For all its modern graphical bells and whistles, I have one major gripe with Battlefield 6 's visuals. And no, it's surprisingly not to do with the performance, as it's one of the only games in recent memory that actually runs really well . My gripe is much more odd: why is the sun so bloody bright? Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times, especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas. It's an issue almost everywhere, but it plagues maps like Operation Firestorm and Liberation Peak, where the contrast is even greater. Thankfully, I can put down my sunglasses, as there is actually a bandaid solution hidden in the game's menus. Simply head into the settings and look for the 'world brightness' option—you'll find it in the accessibility section when you first open settings, or at the top of the graphics tab.

Pandora Tomorrow is back, baby : it's been wordlessly listed on Steam at a 40% discount (and even cheaper on Ubisoft Connect ) without so much as a how'd-you-do. It is officially Pandora Today. Although every other mainline Splinter Cell game has been easy to pick up on PC digital storefronts for years, Pandora Tomorrow has always been strangely and sadly absent from the Ubi digital lineup. The corp wasn't just playing favourites—it wasn't available on Ubisoft Connect (née Uplay) either. That may be because Pandora Tomorrow's PC version was a bit busted (which is saying something for this series on PC: Double Agent will subject you to a gamut of errors and crashes if you dare try to run it). The game would run rife with graphical errors on more recent GPUs, and it's possible Ubi felt it was more trouble than it was worth to fix it up before selling it. Or someone just dropped the USB stick with it on behind a sofa somewhere in Paris. I'd believe ei…",
