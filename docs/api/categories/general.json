Can you switch between the networks, or do you have to pick just one? If you’ve dealt with US Mobile in the past, you might be under the assumption that you have to pick just one network and stick with it, as that was somewhat true in the past, but thankfully not anymore. US Mobile does offer the ability to switch between carriers. In fact, there are two different methods available.",

Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",

Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded .

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung is bringing notification summarization and prioritization features with One UI 8.5, but we’ve discovered certain limitations. These features will only work in the device’s default language, likely disappointing for multilingual users. One UI 8.5 may also bring scam detection that would analyze phone calls using AI for any fraudulent activity, though this feature may be limited to Korea initially. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update is expected to bring significant reforms to the Quick Settings and notifications on eligible Samsung devices. In addition to the visual changes, the update is also likely to bring iOS-like notifications summaries and prioritization features . While useful, these features may not please every user.

Today, one of the earliest manufacturers of Find Hub trackers, Pebblebee, is selling a couple of new trackers that come with some interesting perks. Pebblebee has started sales of new versions of its Clip and Card trackers. They’re both compatible with Google’s Find Hub as well as Apple Find My, and unlike many previous Pebblebee trackers, neither requires a proprietary charger. They’re also marked with QR codes that let anyone who finds them contact you to return your lost item.",

    "body": "TL;DR The first folding iPhone could come with a 24-megapixel under-display selfie camera. Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other. Once Samsung or Google or Apple proves an idea is technically viable and, more importantly, marketable, the other players often move to implement it in their own products. Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7. On balance, this was probably the right move — the Z Fold 6’s under-display camera used a four-megapixel sensor, making for a selfie camera that just wasn’t very go…",
