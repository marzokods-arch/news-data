    "body": "It's been a whole dang decade since Fallout 4 launched, so long that the world has slipped significantly closer to nuclear Armageddon than was the case when Bethesda's post-apocalyptic RPG stepped out from Vault 111. The anniversary has got Bethesda creative chief Todd Howard in a reflective mood, and he's revealed some interesting details about the creation of the game and what the RPG maestros learned from it. One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way.\" Elaborating on why the dialogue system didn't resonate, Howard explained …",

But more likely than not, all you want to know is what's going on with The Elder Scrolls 6. Well, great news: in a recent chat with GQ , Bethesda big boss Todd Howard said that \"The Elder Scrolls 6 is the everyday thing\" that its devs are working on right now. Howard says likes to have a \"break\" between Elder Scrolls games—to avoid them becoming rote and predictable—but admits that while \"It’s also good for an audience to have a break—The Elder Scrolls has been too long.\" Boy, has it—it has been, for those not keeping track, a full 14 years since Skyrim first released, which was itself a mere five years after Oblivion. Howard says he recently oversaw a \"three-hour play test of The Elder Scrolls 6\" for fans who raised money for the Make-A-Wish foundation to get a character made (that'd be the UESP editors who recently visited Bethesda to create a memorial character for community member Loranna…",

Blurbs is a modder and Twitch streamer that’s notorious for tapping into the unhinged hivemind of his viewers: utilising a combination of custom code and Twitch chat to bring to life cursed, user-generated scenarios. Since his inaugural Skyrim experiment —in which chat messages became voice lines for various NPCs—he’s created Mortal Kombat in Red Dead Redemption 2 (challenges ranging from Arthur fighting a deer, to a showdown with Dutch) and has recently turned his attention to modders' paradise GTA 5. Alas, Blurbs doesn't release his mods, so you'll have to make do with watching them on video instead. (Image credit: Rockstar Games) Getting the NPCs to commit insurance fraud was easy in Los Santos.

I first played the iconic PS1 titles Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 7, and even PS2's Silent Hill 2 on PC. Now, the most exciting new game releases on PS5 don't take long to come to PC. It's a thrill to not only play fab indie gems on the Steam Deck, but take PS5 games on the go that would otherwise be bound to a big screen at home.

But there may be another reason behind those layoffs, namely that the player count for Dune: Awakening is dwindling. In fact, for the first time since Dune: Awakening launched, the number of players recently dropped below that of Funcom's other survival MMO, Conan Exiles, which released way back in 2018. The shift was spotted by Reddit user m3d1t8 (via GamesRadar ), who posted a screenshot showing that, at the time it was taken, 7,458 players were exploring Arrakis, while 7,706 players were enjoying Conan Exiles. \"The unbelievable has happened and Dune now has fewer active players than Conan,\" m3d1t8 marvelled, adding. \"I remember two months ago someone foreseeing that Dune would dip below Conan and thinking no wayyyy.

However, company CEO He Xiaopeng has since attempted to expose the Iron's mechanical innards, both on-stage and off (via Mashable ). After offering a sneak peek of what lies beneath the Iron's soft shell on social media , Xiaopeng then took to the stage for a more drastic demonstration. For the banishment of all doubt, the Xpeng robotics team took a pair of scissors to the Iron, cutting away not only its soft outer shell but its artificial muscles as well, completely exposing the metal rod supports and servos below. The Iron is very clearly not a person in a morph suit—however, that doesn't mean it's the future either. The smoothness of this robot's movements across a completely flat surface is impressive, though I'm a little unclear on what gap in the market the Iron hopes to fill as it approaches mass …",

Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year. Sony has yet to confirm the authenticity of these symbols. But PC/PS5 cross-buy would certainly fall i…",

YouTuber and minimalist hardware extraordinaire Vimpo has created a tiny custom Minecraft server implementation for machines with limited resources—and to show off its potential, they've got it running on a smart bulb , of all things. The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub . The server binary size is a mere 46 KB without the authentication library and 90 KB with it onboard, while the memory usage is sai…",

More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor.

    "body": "The Kickstarter-backed adventure game revival brought us the likes of Broken Age, Night in the Woods, Beacon Pines, a whole bunch of remasters and remakes, and I suppose Undertale, but among all those you might have missed Bulb Boy. This 2D point-and-click from 2015 brought a Tim Burton flair to the genre, tasking you with saving your family—including Grandpa-raffin and Mothdog—from the dark monsters that have overtaken your home. Bringing light to the darkness is made a bit easier by the fact you are Bulb Boy, a boy who can unscrew your lightbulb head to help you solve puzzles. Also, you're immune to being electrocuted, just in case that should ever come in handy. It's a puzzle-adventure in the Machinarium style, full of secrets and silliness. Bulb Boy is currently available for free on Steam to bring attention to its recently released sequel, Bulb Boy 2: Jar of Despair . This time, Bulb Boy's mission is to find a jam jar in the cellar of the Bulb House, a simple task made nightmarish by the creature who wants to take your head for its own. It's got a demo if you want to try before you buy. The Bulb Boy adventures are twisted affairs that look like they're entirely made up of the…",

The only problem is that the engineered life forms, the Scale, have somehow made it on to the ship and now everything has gone very, very wrong. You and your people have hidden in the maintenance tunnels, but now the monstrosity is colonizing them too, so you've got to go into the biomes and build yourselves sustainable communities from the wreckage there—a landscape now populated by weird mutants that the Scale left in its wake. How will you do that? By eating a lot of crickets, apparently. Like. So many crickets. Yes, that's right, folks. Cricket mush is nutritious.

It's easy to dismiss videogame recipe books as a frivolous marketing gimmick, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone else. My original plan for this article was to find the most preposterous example of a gaming-themed cookbook, then attempt to recreate the silliest recipe from it. I assumed this would be easy. I mean, nobody could actually write a good Sonic-themed cookbook, could they? Yet when I looked into this odd corner of gaming culture, I noticed two things. First, many of the gaming-themed recipe books you'll find on Amazon are not only well designed, but they're also filled with dishes that look like something you would actually want to eat.
