It contained locations, textures, and even whole NPCs that were ultimately cut to get the finished game down to a more workable size. But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return. There are actually a few mods bringing Marilyn back, but I went with the straightforward Marilyn Restored for my current loadout. On the subject of Mr. House, the skeevy Steve Buscemi-looking original depiction of the character is also back thanks to Restored Beta Mr House , and if you really want to go all the way his Lucky 38 casino was supposed …",

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",

Project Misriah: Halo Ports was a collection of Counter-Strike 2 maps that recreated Halo 3's multiplayer in Valve's shooter sequel. Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\". The crux of the issue here seems to be that Project Misriah uses assets from the Halo games, hence the use of the phrase \"Halo game content\".

Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best.

Because it really is crucial, even if it did take Blizzard 21 bloody years to get with the program. MMOs are, in a lot of ways, about expression. In ye olden days of the internet, there was (and still is) a game called Second Life —this game is pretty much built on top of player-submitted stuff. Custom avatars, and, more to the point, UGC residencies that take place on a \"grid\".

In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches. To summarise, planets no longer generate resources by default, with resource production instead based upon population. Hence, if a planet's population takes a big hit thr…",

What order should you play the Divinity games in?

In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

So unfinished that it doesn't so much have a final level as it does an idea for one that you just kind of percolate through until you hit credits. I can't blame Obsidian; the studio had an incredibly short time with which to actually, you know, make the game. It's a game that would be well-served by a remake, in other words—something that had the time necessary to give the original's vision the attention it deserved. Turns out, just such a remake was—perhaps is —notionally in the making. That's according to Game File's recent scoop on Aspyr's ill-fated attempt to get The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (the popular mod that restores a lot of cut-but-still-on-disc content to the game) onto the Nintendo Switch. More on those efforts later. Court filings from the now-settled gamer's lawsuit against Aspyr —initiated by a fan upset at the studio's \"false advertising\" of TSLRCM on Switch—have revealed the existence of project Juliet. That's the name Aspyr and Lucasfilm used for a full-on KOTOR 2 remake. \"We were going to do a full remake of KOTOR 2,\" Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reill…",

The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

We know what Larian's next game is. It's Divinity —just Divinity—and I'd bet several dollars it's a soft reboot for a series which is going to pull in exponentially more players after the mondo success of Baldur's Gate 3. So if we can't argue about what that statue is or what Larian's next game will be anymore, what's left to us? Fear not: we've already started arguing about whether Divinity will be a turn-based game when it eventually arrives, or if it'll revive the old, hallowed ways of realtime with pause, like its Infinity Engine forefathers of olde. In fact, the debate went on before Divinity was even officially revealed at The Game Awards. \"There are rumors that Larian's next game 'Divinity' is NOT turn-based…\" tweeted content creator SynthPotato . Well, that set the cat among the pigeons. \"That would be terrible. They're the best in the world at turn based,\" read one reply. \"I would love for them to try out an ARPG again,\" read another.
