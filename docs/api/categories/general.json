Starting at $749, global sales will begin on November 19, with early-bird vouchers and discounts available beforehand. When it comes to gaming phones , REDMAGIC has been releasing a steady stream of powerful devices that punch well above their price point, and the latest is now here to take things to the next level. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 phones to hit the market, but it has a few extra features that no phone can match. Starting with the SoC, the 8 Elite Gen 5 is the latest and greatest on the market, with our early testing indicating a 20% bump in CPU and GPU performance in reference devices for testing. We are still actively benchmarking the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, and those gains appear to hold true in this device as well. Stay tuned for our full test results and benchmarks later this week.",

This Tuesday, T-Mobile will give away free beanies as part of its weekly subscriber rewards system. As The Mobile Report notes, this is a classic beanie in T-Mobile’s signature magenta color, featuring a black band and the carrier’s tiny logo.

This feature is currently available in the US only, and can be accessed by tapping on the Ask tab in the Photos app. Google Photos v7.52.0 includes code for a new way to access Ask Photos, and we’ve managed to activate it before its launch to give you an early look.

Naturally, I headed straight there to pre-book a Pixel 10 , trading in my old Pixel 6a that I had lying around.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Lately, though, projectors have been making a play for the spotlight (literally). Impressive new models with Google TV baked in are turning heads and, in some cases, vying to replace your TV. From pocket-sized companions like the XGIMI MoGo 4 to living room workhorses like BenQ’s GV32, the projector market is starting to redirect from hobbyist to mainstream consumers. Where do you land?",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus’ next small phone just leaked, and it packs big upgrades. The OnePlus 15T is expected to feature a larger battery, an improved fingerprint scanner, and a new Snapdragon chipset. The sad part, though, is that OnePlus might not launch it in the US. The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S . Therefore, it could be speculated to be called the OnePlus 15T or 15S, in line with the naming convention for the recently launched flagship.",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Code within One UI 8.5 suggests Samsung could bring a new “Adaptive data saver” feature to Galaxy phones. The feature works by only downloading videos in social media apps when you are “ready to watch them.” This feature can help users with limited mobile data plans manage their social media data usage effectively. One UI 8.5 is expected to be a big update for Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, in ways that One UI 8 wasn’t. We’re expecting plenty of new features, ranging from Pro camera presets and sharing to Galaxy S26 Ultra exclusive features like Private Display , and more. We’ve now spotted another new feature in the works for One UI 8.5, and this one will likely be appreciated by people who don’t have unlimited data access all the time.

The demo builds on earlier versions, such as Google Martha, showing Gemini identifying objects and offering real-time assistance. Magic Leap has extended its partnership with Google by three years and will act as an AR ecosystem partner, rather than a hardware maker. It’s only been a week since Samsung kicked off the Android XR era with its Galaxy XR headset , but Google’s already looking beyond bulky headsets to something much lighter. At the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh, Google and Magic Leap showed off a new Android XR glasses prototype — the first time we’ve seen Google concept glasses on stage since I/O in the summer. As reported by Android Central , the two companies also confirmed they’ve extended their partnership for another three years. Magic Leap first teamed up with Google in 2024, combining its optics and manufacturing know-how with Google’s AI and display technology.",
