    "body": "Phasmophobia's early access build celebrates its sixth anniversary as a viral ghost-hunting breakout on Steam later this year, but that's assuming we make it to September before the 1.0 launch. If Kinetic Games' latest roadmap stays on track, then we'll be cutting it close, as Phasmophobia is planning for its 1.0 launch with a horror rework and lore update sometime this year. It's a big year for Phas as the horror rework and lore updates coupled with 1.0's debut are one of several major patches outlined. There's also a Unity 6 and network update on the roadmap that I hope will fix some of the frustrating connection issues I occasionally run into, and the long-awaited player character overhaul launches soon. I'm stoked to finally show up to the function (hopefully) not wearing the same thing as three of my friends. And by wearing the same thing, I mean all playing as the exact same guy with no way of knowing who's who. Anyway, as is Phasmophobia tradition, the Kinetic team is pretty hush-hush about the finer details around big patch plans, keeping things scarier for all of us come launch day. So, for a little extra roadmap context, I've scraped together a bit of what we do know and…",

And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",

So, basically anything to do with Xbox and gaming for Microsoft is on the slide, though as The Verge notes, Microsoft isn't releasing any information on Xbox Game Pass membership rates. That obviously makes it difficult to gauge the impact of the Game Pass Ultimate price hike , which wasn't exactly warmly received by gamers. Microsoft's whole Xbox endeavour, of course, is currently in flux. The company has continued to publish more games for play on Sony's competing PS5 console as part of its broader—and some would argue, incredibly confusing—\" This is an Xbox \" push to redefine what an Xbox means. That push will even extend to jealously guarded IP such as H…",

    "body": "If you're unaware that, somewhere in the bowels of Ubisoft's offices, an unannounced Black Flag remake is almost certainly bubbling away, then congratulations on waking from your coma. It's perhaps the most open secret in videogames right now, spoiled ahead of time by everything from age rating boards to anonymous sources to its own lead actor , Matt Ryan—who subsequently told a different fan pressing him for info that'd say nothing more, because \" the company threatened to sue me \". I guess Ubi's loosened up since then, because the official Assassin's Creed X account is now posting GTA memes about yet another possible leak. AC fan account Zephryss posted images of a statuette of Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, writing that it \"might be the new Edward Kenway figurine for the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake\" and had been found by fans on second-hand site Vinted. In response, the AC account posted that old classic: CJ returning to San Andreas with the subtitles \"Ah shit, here we go again.\" For reference, this would be the second time this remake has been leaked by a statue , if genuine. Which is quite funny, to be fair, and makes sense: as I've written in too many headlines…",

World of Warcraft players aren't pleased with the pre-patch event for The War Within, and less than a week later, Blizzard updates the event to have less stingy rewards . It is October 2024. I am writing about how Blizzard has done this four times in a year , once more (with feeling) during the anniversary event. It is November 2024. Director Ion Hazzikostas outright says , \"while playing a bit of that guessing game of trying to pick the right values, we may tend to err on the conservative side\" because \"we can always buff the rewards. We're never going to nerf the rewards, really, right?\" It is January 2026. You'll never guess what happened. World of Warcraft: Midnight's pre-patch event has been released, and players have been complaining that it's a little stingy—the event itself is neat, mind.
