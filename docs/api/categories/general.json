No enemy is safe from the barrage of projectiles that cover the entire screen and hit for billions of damage. Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters. That alone will only tickle monsters, which is why you have to flip on one of season 10's new Chaos Perks, Unstable Power, that makes basic skills always deal massive damage with …",

In pursuit of greater horizons to conquer, the anime action game is going to get its own mode where user-created stuff is king. It's called Miliastra Wonderland and it's such a blatant copy of Roblox that it's funny to listen to people explain it without making the obvious comparison. Instead of playing as your normal gacha-rolled anime characters, you get to customize one of your own and wear outfits unlocked through crafting and the battle pass. You can hang out and emote with other players in an open area called the \"Wonderland Lobby\". In the next major patch, update 6.1, this place will be decorated with jack-o'-lanterns and candles, but I assume it'll change with every season. The main draw of the new mode is all the minigames you can play. There will be a whole Roblox-style catalogue of user-created games spanning several genres, including FPS, roguelike, management sim, and survival. Creators set up the rules and can even include achievements and leaderboards if they want.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is one of the most infamous misfires of gaming history, a disaster of a scale that's relatively rare in the upper echelons of game development. Virtually everyone who played it at the time acknowledged that it was a buggy, broken, unfinished mess, and there were rumblings that Gearbox outsourced large portions of the game's development while it focused on building Borderlands 2. There's been little inclination to reappraise Colonial Marines since, and I'm not really interested in this either. The base game is simply too compromised to attempt some contrived reinterpretation of it as some misunderstood classic.

Vietnam, in case you're not already aware from going there, geography lessons, or ambient exposure to dozens of war movies, is almost half covered by jungle, and was more than half-covered by jungle prior to the Vietnam War. And the thing about jungle is the density of foliage makes it hard to see much else, like the sky, or passing animals, or someone with a rifle trying to murder you. Getting killed outta nowhere is kinda how war rolls, especially from the First World War onward, but it doesn't make for an especially fun or balanced play experience. It's a dilemma that Expression Games has wrestled with for a while, as technical director Kieran D'Archambaud explained in the latest issue of PC Gamer : \"Particularly if you're new to the game, it can be very hard to understand where you're dying from.\" Expression's solution is to …",

Oh, and a camera for taking photos of cryptids with. Lone Pine National Park contains several undocumented species and it's your job to document them.

EA is working on a fix, but that's not good enough for Battlefield boss Vince Zampella. In a reply to a spurned fan on X , Zampella gave the sort of recommendation that any reasonable PC gamer would give in this situation: \"Can you refund and buy on Steam?\" Surely yes, they can, but it's a little surprising to hear that from Mr. EA. \"I have yelled about EA App people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?\" he asked in a post higher in the thread. (Image credit: Vince Zampella via X) Is Vince asking us who he should be yelling at to fix this problem? Surely he'd know better than us, but maybe he's just trying to make it as clear as possible that he's miffed. At this point, everyone on this big blue marble knows how badly the EA App sucks.

The good news is that the mod is not at risk of being derailed: Eminoma said it's \"still very much on track for full release,\" and that the effort to get everything ready for the cancelled open beta means it's \"probably in a better spot than we would have been if we never attempted this in the first place.\" But there is also the possibility that something may have to change—specifically, the name of the mod.

Battlefield 6 is checking both of those boxes at launch with Portal, a web tool and SDK that lets people fire up persistent custom games and create new game modes. There is no more perfect day-one demonstration of what Portal can do than this surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4 Shipment by game dev Matavatar , who had a working version of the map up a day before Battlefield 6 was even live (EA released the Portal editor a bit early). I played a few minutes of Matavatar's Shipment in a server someone had going and, yep, they pretty much nailed it. Because of how Portal works at the moment, the map itself was actually suspended in the air somewhere in the skybox of Operation Firestorm, which is giving early Portal creations a Halo Forge-y feel (which I mean in a complimentary way). It's kind of wild that EA is letting people not only host custom maps from the jump, but even earn XP from playing in them. That means right now, you can hop in a Shipment 24/7 playlist (which already exists) and enjoy a mode that Call of Duty players usually have to beg …",

Since it brings the raw stopping power of an LMG with the faster, more versatile handling of an assault rifle, the DRS is great for almost all of Battlefield 6's maps.

Take a bow Saint Riot, a streamer who mainly focuses on FromSoftware games but has taken a break with the (excellent) remake of Final Fantasy Tactics, and dared to ask the big question: do chocobos believe in god? Well… do they? To briefly explain: one of the character stats in FFT is faith, which is a double-edged sword that measures a character's faith in the divine as a percentage. A higher faith stat means their magic attacks are more effective, but they also take more damage from magic. The important thing here though is that, if a character's Faith score hits 95 and stays there, that character will leave your party to go find god. One more thing. The Orator class can use an ability called Beast Tongue to take control of a monster (such as a chocobo) and use it in battle, and the creature will level up.

While other games might have dialogue-skip functions with hardly a problem, the way BL4 works means that \"This request is way more involved and riskier that it appears on the surface with how dialog is integrated within our mission system\".

Best Battlefield 6 guns The best guns I've used so far in BF6 are: M4A1 (rank 2, carbine) M87A1 (rank 0, shotgun) PW7A2 (rank 19, SMG) DRS-IAR (rank 9, LMG) M277 (rank 11, carbine) SG 553R (Danger Close assignment, carbine) M4A1 The M4A1 carbine, unlocked at just Rank 2, is one of the best weapons in the entire game. Thanks to its high fire rate and solid damage, the M4A1 is capable of dropping enemies blazingly fast. Now, you might think that these positives must mean the M4A1 is weak at range. It should be, but it's not. With just a converter and vertical grip, you can negate most of the re…",

    "body": "The L110 is the starter LMG (or light machine gun) in Battlefield 6 , and as you'd expect, it's capable of spitting out an absolute storm of bullets before having to reload. The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending. If you're using an LMG as Support (which you should be), you'll also get additional bonuses to ADS and sprint speed, helping to make things a tad more competitive. Best L110 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) Here's the build I've been using for the L110: Muzzle: Compensated Brake (20) Barrel: 465MM LB (10) Underbarrel: Stippled Stubby (35) Magazine: 100RND…",

    "body": "Carbines are perhaps the single best weapon type in Battlefield 6 , with the M4A1 and M277 continuing their domination from the beta. With weak default attachments, the best M277 loadout does take a bit of work, but it's worth it in the end. By default, the M277 has some of the worst recoil deviation of any weapon. When combined with a frustratingly small 20-round magazine, it's hard to consistently score kills at range or multi-kills. The M277's stock attachments look very cool and tactical, but it's not all that optimal to have a suppressor and large optic on a weapon with so much kick and so few bullets. So, here's what you need to do. Best M277 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) Here's the build I recommend for the M277: Muzzle: Double-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Heavy Extended 16\" Custom (10) Underbarrel: Alloy Vertical (20) Magazine: 25RND Fast Magazine (25) Ammunition: Standard (5) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) or RO-M 1.75x (10) Accessory: 50MW Blue (20) The Double-Port Brake and the Alloy Vertical grip are the two most important attachments on the M277, so it's good that you unlock them relatively early. These combine to significantly reduce the recoil of sustained and…",

    "body": "So, you've decided to become a sniper in Battlefield 6 . It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way. All that said, here's my preferred setup for the starting sniper rifle in Battlefield 6.

We've seen prices float down to MSRP, and even below that in the recent October Prime Day sales. And now, if my eyes do not deceive me, I believe this is a single-slot RTX 5060 Ti. Yes, we have here a current-gen graphics card that takes up just a single PCIe slot. Yes, 2025—who'd have thought? The Galax RTX 5060 Ti Unparallelled Max 16 GB (via MyDrivers ) is a veritable sheet of paper by today's standards (cue gif of Senor Chang staring at a tiny piece of paper ). It's not the first we've seen of the Unparalleled Max, as we saw the single-slot RTX 4060 Ti version last year. In fact, that's the only reason I know it's called \"Unparalleled\", because the machine translation on my end spits out \"wushuang\", which could be translated as any number of vaguely similar words to \"unparalleled.\" The fact that there's no English product page yet means we might have to wait a while to see this card in the West.
