With a combination of a second generation transformer model and an expanded Multi Frame Generation feature offering up to 6x frame gen, the green team reckons it can deliver \"incredible 240 Hz+ smoothness\" in some of the most graphically intensive games around. Though, I'm guessing your mileage may vary. MFG (or Multi Frame Generation if you're not into the whole brevity thing) was introduced at CES last year as one of the fancy new features of the RTX Blackwell GPU generation. It follows the now-familiar pattern of the original DLSS Frame Generation style of using a mixture of frame interpolation, optical flow calculations, and AI image generation to smooth out your gameplay. Except with MFG on RTX Blackwell chips you're adding in up to three completely generated frames in between each actually rendered one, and now using a new optical flow AI model instead of dedicated accelerator hardware with an enhanced display engine to help frame pacing.

This is just a CES tease, however, so we don't even know what Alienware is going to call its new range of ultraslim gaming laptops, but at the Dell CES 2026 pre-briefing it showed off the new ~17 mm thin design. The idea being to create a \"jack of all trades\" that will appeal to gamers and creators alike; for people who don't want to have a machine that screams 'I AM A GAMER' while still delivering on performance. \"We focused on two main details: performance density and design versatility,\" Matt McGowan, head of product at Alienware, tells us. \"We wanted to pack as much performance as possible into the most compact design we could engineer. \"It's a 16-inch laptop that's roughly 50% smaller than our 16-inch Area-51.

Dell's COO, Jeff Clarke, spoke at the start of our CES 2026 pre-briefing in December about the company wanting to get back to its roots and also broaden its horizons. \"It's a scale business, all 280 million units matter… You can't succeed if you're treating a portion of it like a distant relative... If I give you one thing to walk away with, it's the following: the consumer business is important to Dell.\" The whole briefing felt very much like a mea culpa from the massive PC box shifter, but it looks like the company is putting its product where its marketing mouth is, what with the return of the XPS brand, reining back its effusive AI marketing, and throwing cheaper Alienware notebooks out into the wild. The words 'Alienware' and 'entry-level' are not normally associated with each other, and it's perhaps a measure of where Dell finds itself right now that its traditionally premium-focused gaming brand is looking for a new market. \"This is an entry-level l…",

In the case of AMD, however, it's pretty much a case of 'more of the same, but just a little bit faster'. And when it comes to the newly launched Ryzen 7 9850X3D, that 'little' really isn't very big at all. The listed specifications for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are entirely unsurprising, not least because all the previous leaks and rumours on the new chip all tallied on the point of it just sporting a small increase to the boost clock. It's literally just a Ryzen 7 9800X3D , with a 7.7% overclock. (Image credit: AMD) It's not the first Zen 5 X3D processor that AMD has released that's faster than the 9800X3D, though. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D has two core chiplets (CCDs), one with 3D V-cache, and one without. When it comes to boost clocks, the latter can hit 5.7 GHz, whereas the former topped out at 5.5 GHz in the tests I carried out in my review of the 9950X3D . This suggests that the CCDs rolling off TSMC's production lines are generally very high quality, resulting in a surfeit of CCDs that, when they've also gone through the V-cache packing routine, are more than capable …",

Or alternatively, two HP gaming brands, HyperX and Omen, which have now been smushed together to create... HyperX Omen. The first offspring from this union is the HyperX Omen Max 16 gaming laptop, which, in terms of its chassis design, looks a whole lot like the HP Omen Max 16 of old with two letters removed from the bottom of the screen. Yep, blink and you'll miss it, but it now sports a dose of HyperX branding beneath its 16-inch display, along with a big \"HX\" logo on the rear lid. (Image credit: HP) The chassis design looks to be pretty much the same, but HP has made some changes underneath the hood. While the GPU options still range between the RTX 5070 Ti mobile and the top whack RTX 5090, the CPU choices are now either AMD's newly-announced Ryzen AI 400-series chips, or a \"next gen Intel processor\", according to the press release. No prizes for guessing what that might be . The mega-spec lappy also comes with a new GAN power brick that's capable of delivering 300 W total platform power, without weighing the same as a boat anchor.

Maybe it's that January arrives to see us flush with holiday cash and looking to link up with friends instead of spending more time with relatives, but the first couple months of the year always seem to be dominated by surprisingly huge co-op hits. My incontrovertible evidence: 2025: REPO (February) : 271,571 concurrent players 2024: Palworld (January) : 2,101,867 concurrents 2023: Sons of the Forest (February) : 414,257 concurrents 2022: *crickets* 2021: Valheim (February) : 502,387 concurrents Admittedly I couldn't really find something that fits for 2022. (Lost Ark blew up huge in February 2022 to the tune of 1,325,305 concurrent players, but it's a free-to-play MMO so that feels like cheating.) Still, the trend is mostly true: early in the year there's almost always some big co-op hit that busts the doors off Steam. These games are usually pretty inexpensive, especially in comparison to the eye-watering $70 price tags of some games these days, and they're often early access, survival-ish, basebuilder-y games…",

It's fed by a newly-designed pump that MSI says delivers 71% increased flow over previous GPU pump iterations, which is in turn attached to a full copper, full cover cold plate arrangement designed to keep things frosty. With a carbon fibre plate on the back, naturally. And frosty it'll need to be, as this beast is built to draw huge amounts of power.

What I can tell you is that it \"delivers ultra-fast wireless performance,\" alongside lower power consumption, and the flexibility of hot swappable switches. So, if TMR isn't your thing for whatever reason, the MX 8.2 will allow you to swap between both magnetic and mechanical switches. If you stick with the Cherry MK Crystal Magnetic switches, you'll enjoy \"ultra-smooth linear input with 0.01 mm precision\" alongside an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The wireless, tenkeyless MX 8.2 Pro TMR keyboard will cost about $250 when it releases on January 29, though it won't be lonely in the lineup for long. The K5 Pro TMR keyboard—a follow-up to the wired Cherry Xtrfy K5V2 from 2024—will drop later in the Spring.

Rosen was a former US airman stationed in post-war Japan and the Far East, and after his service ended in 1952 stayed in Japan, first founding the company Rosen Enterprises, Inc., which sold Japanese art in the US market and also had a successful business in photo booths called Photorama. In 1957, the company's focus changed to importing coin-operated amusement machines to Japan, which proved lucrative, and establishing its own venues. \"Right off the bat, the machines were tremendously successful,\" Rosen told Next Generation Magazine in 1996 . \"At this point, I was opening up arcades with these shooting and hunting games throughout Japan, and we were fortunate… I don’t know [how many we had], but by the time I left, there wasn’t a city in Japan that didn’t have one of our arcades.\" In 1965, Rosen Enterprises merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan, which used Sega as a brand name for coin-op machines: the name comes from a contra…",

In a chat with PC Gamer , Warhorse co-founder and KCD2 executive producer Martin Klima recalled a scrapped system that would have seen Henry gain and lose weight depending on how much you ate, preventing you from wearing certain items of clothing and armour. \"Currently in the game as we released it, all men wear the same clothes you do… basically, you can put on anything that you find,\" Klima said.

Is there evidence for this? Nope— quite the opposite, actually —but it endures because it jibes with the worldview of certain Fallout fans who see Bethesda as perverting the series. Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game.
