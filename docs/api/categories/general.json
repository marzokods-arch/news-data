Do you jump on the Hall effect bandwagon to ensure you're bang on trend, and able to deliver that customisable actuation and rapid trigger response all the aspiring pros desire? Or do you stick with tried and tested mechanical keys, which still represent the vast majority of the gaming keeb market but don't offer the same customisation or response times as those analogue switch whippersnappers? Razer's latest V4 incarnation of the BlackWidow—ahem, sorry, BlackWidow Low-Profile Tenkeyless Hyperspeed —sticks in old-school mechanical territory, but pairs that ol' reliable tactical switch feel with low-profile keys that have a shorter travel from starting position to the bottom of the keypress. It can be used wired or wireless, has three control buttons and a clickable volume roller, and the stated 980-hour battery life is impressive enough. But the real crux of this product is the feel of the keypress. Which means it's a very subjective object to review. My review sample's fitted with Razer's proprietary orange low-profile mechanical switches, one of three options which also include 'crisp and clicky' green switches, and a 'smooth and si…",

No longer simply issuing specs and outsourcing the rest, Valve is set to fully realise what was at best a half-formed vision more than a decade ago, while also fortifying its existing hardware successes. Valve has introduced a number of new branches to its hardware ecosystem, including the aforementioned PC-for-the-TV device. But who is it for? And is Valve really angling for a slice of the console market? While we know the Steam Machine will release early next year, we don't yet know how much it will go for—but I'm feeling hopeful it could be an affordable, accessible option for the PC gaming-curious. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: PC gaming is an expensive hobby. After the not small upfront cost of building your very first rig, there's the regular rhythm of pricey hardware upgrades (to say nothing at all about the cost of repairs and replacement parts). So, could the Steam Machine corner the market of folks curious about the power and customisability of PC gaming, but who still want to hit the ground running when it comes to gaming?

Whether that's using the environment to throw yourself into space , or various items in ways they're not really meant to be used in, I'm always impressed with just how quickly everyone else seems to find these loopholes. With that being said, Peak's newest patch update has decided to encourage players to continue doing this by buffing one of the game's most exploited items - the Scout Cannon. These updates mean the Scout Cannon can now launch zombies, which is perfect for anyone struggling to make their way through the Roots biome. The weight of the item has also been reduced from six to four, which is pretty huge news, as one of the sole reasons I don't carry it around is because of how heavy it is and how much stamina I lose when doing so. Outside of this, some smaller tweaks like making the cannon easier to jump out of and the forced ragdoll time being reduced have been made, too. With the reintroduction of the Scout Cannon glitch, I genuinely fear for the power speedrunners now have when it comes to reaching the Peak. However, outside of these significant Scout Cannon buffs, an issue the game has…",

    "body": "Resident Evil Requiem is the first entry in the series to be set in Raccoon City since Resident Evil 3, though Resident Evil 6 dipped its toes in the setting. As a result, Requiem is already looking very different to its two immediate predecessors: instead of seedy backwaters and toothless hicks, the footage we've seen thus far takes place in the claustrophobic environs of faceless high rises and labyrinthine halls. In that sense, it's quite reminiscent of Resident Evil 2. During a chat with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, I noted the shared DNA in Resident Evil 4 and Village, and asked if Requiem might have a similar relationship with any older entry in the series. He confirmed my theory with no hesitation: \"I believe in that regard, it's very close to Resident Evil 2,\" he said. Aside from the setting, Requiem also has a stronger focus on the qualities of its player-character than the last two instalments. Sure, Ethan Winters had a backstory, a personality, and a very pressing motive, but Kumazawa makes an interesting distinction between Ethan and Requiem's new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, who is extremely vulnerable and unused to confrontation or violence. \"When you look at Res…",

The Wake of the Water update arrived this week, bringing a new high-level biome to the already massive Embervale map. Veilwater Basin is a tropical jungle filled with lakes, waterways, and sunken ruins to explore, and the region is also perfect for building a new base because you can put all that water to use. Since Enshrouded's water is simulated in real time, you can dig canals for irrigating crops or powering new crafting stations, and you can move water around in containers to fill your own lakes and ponds. There are even waterproof walls included in the update if you want to build an underwater base—and something tells me you do. Just be careful: if you remove the wrong block down there, water will immediately begin flooding your submerged home. You're not the only one moving into Veilwater Basin. A lizard-like race called Drak are also elbowing their way into the region, and not only are they strong swimmers but they can use weapons underwater—unlike you. You might w…",

The ex Geralt never properly ended things with, and the canon love interest as book readers will tell you (it's me, I'm book readers), she complicates Geralt's love life and forces him to belatedly grow up—which feels thematically appropriate, as he retakes his place as Ciri's father figure over the course of the game. Yet that element wasn't always part of The Witcher 3.

The series started out great. It gave the stale and yet seemingly never-ending Alien saga something it really needed: a kick in the butt. Instead of just one Alien, it gave us a bunch of different types of aliens, including a weird eyeball creature that is both horrifying and yet kinda cuddly? Instead of a single android, standard for Alien movies, it also featured a cyborg and several synthetic people with human minds transplanted into them.

If you're not familiar, Age of Wonders marries the deep strategy of 4X to turn-based tactical RPG gameplay. It also grounds a lot of the map-painting in intuitive, tangible roleplay scenarios: You don't play a faceless nation, but a customizable ruler and culture, gathering magical artifacts, schools of magic, skills, and provinces as you explore the world. You can play as anything from classic fantasy dwarfs to gothic, power-mad molemen, and territory is won with turn-based battles made up of your custom troops.

It was a rip-the-band-aid-off opening for a presentation that quickly moved on to what Ghost Ship's doing in the meantime: launching a new season for Deep Rock Galactic, its first since 2024, while it continues work on the roguelite spin-off for next year. \"At Ghost Ship Games we've realized we can't have our cake and eat it at the same time, and do everything ourselves,\" Pedersen said. That's why the studio is following the Dead Cells playbook, partnering with another developer nearby in Copenhagen to create season six, which will come to Deep Rock early next year. The big draw for the new season is a spooky biome littered with the giant bones of ancient beasts, with a new enemy species to go with it. There are three types of Ossirans lurking in the Ossuary Depths, including a flying pest called the Scrab, the Pit Jaw, a \"living bear trap\" that can grab you if you walk over it, and the Bone Collector, which will pop up in other biomes.

Released earlier this month alongside the Creations Bundle (which is struggling under a \"mostly negative\" rating) to celebrate Fallout 4's 10 th anniversary , the intent was to simplify the process of finding and accessing externally-developed content—the Creations in question. Instead, however, it made a rather big mess of things : breaking existing mods, introducing new bugs, and causing crashes and performance issues. With Fallout fans decidedly unhappy about the whole thing, Bethesda now says it is \" actively investigating \" issues with the troublesome Fallout 4 update and Anniversary Edition, and that players \"should now see faster load times of the Creations menu, game menu, and redemption of Creation Club items.\" A hotfix is planned for early next week (so, not all that hot, really) that aims to address other issues, specifically: Fixing stability problems particularly on XB1/PS4.

The diner is a noticeable upgrade from Phasmophobia's early days where you scoured barren spaces for otherworldly clues amongst a room full of stock assets. I recognized very little outside of the intentional tie-in to other maps, but welcomed the unfamiliarity. It's just scarier when you don't recall the same few books or plates hurled at you by an angry spirit. There's little attention-to-detail items strewn about the restaurant too, like a leaflet reference to Maple Lodge Campsite, spooky arcade machines to interact with, a functional jukebox, and cans of sprayable cream ghosts seem to love. I should know, as just about every haunted tour I went on with the game's developers went straight for fiddling with the cream. You can even hear the haunted hiss over the Parabolic Mic.

What better time, then, for the big fella to finally get his own tabletop RPG? As revealed by our friends over at GamesRadar , IDW Games will be launching a Kickstarter for the game in March. One promising detail is the talent on the design side—it's being written by Gav Thorpe, Jervis Johnson, and Mark A Latham. Those are three legendary names in tabletop gaming, particularly on the wargaming side of things. They've all done serious time in senior positions at Games Workshop on Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer 40,000, and more. Thorpe also worked on videogames including For Honor and Space Hulk: Deathwing, and Latham designed Modiphius' Skyrim wargame and The Walking Dead: All Out War.

But apart from the over-abundance of still-somehow-funny 'GabeCube' comments, what I've seen perhaps the most is people questioning why the Steam Machine has just 8 GB of VRAM. It's not a new phenomenon; people have been complaining about graphics cards having just 8 GB of VRAM for years now. The problem really rose to the forefront with the RTX 4060 Ti , which initially launched with just 8 GB of VRAM to the chagrin of some . Nvidia then released a 16 GB version with a much higher price tag, which people also didn't like—many seemed to just want a 16 GB version with the 8 GB's price tag. The complaint is that 8 GB of VRAM isn't enough for gaming in 2025 in many cases. And this much is true for at least some games to run at higher settings, such as Hogwarts Legacy and The Last of Us Part 1 —this was resolved in The Last of Us Part 2 , though. Even when games don't seem to be trying to use more than 8 GB of VRAM, that might be because they're choosing not to stream as many or higher-re…",

Reddit user akia_Gecko has also uploaded a video to YouTube showing those log file writes by the AMD graphics driver in response to minor window movements. And it certainly looks pretty scary. As akia_Gecko says, \"every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.\" Of course, SSDs can be read almost indefinitely, but writes cause actual wear. Hammer an SSD with enough writes, and you'll kill it eventually. However, it does not necessarily follow that AMD's graphics driver will obliterate your SSD. Indeed, the AMD graphics driver probably isn't doing anything abnormal, because this kind of data logging is normal behaviour for a device driver.

I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay.
