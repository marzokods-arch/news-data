The 27-year-old musician has fought for fairer representation and pay for songwriters in the music industry. She was a leading voice in a campaign that resulted in U.K. major labels committing to introducing a per diem and cover expenses for songwriters attending their writing sessions, marking the first time such an initiative has been brought up anywhere in the world. Speaking from the stage at the Intercontinental London, RAYE said, “Being a songwriter is also one of the greatest privileges, and I think it’s something that should be about grafting and talent, not about how rich you are, or to be in a good situation financially to be a songwriter. It shouldn’t be about that.” She continued to ask for more changes in the way that songwriters are compensated. She called for “points on the master” in reference to royalty splits, and acknowledged that she might be “pissing people off” but that the fact songwriters aren’t recognized “doesn’t make any sense to me.&#8221; RAYE added, “Songwriters, I want to encourage us to talk in the songwriter split co…",

Swift’s last album, 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department , may have scored the superstar’s biggest opening-week debut and ruled the charts for months on end, but the sprawling, relatively mournful project was a departure from the immaculately constructed pop anthems that had defined her career (give or take a Folk-more ) for a decade. When Swift announced that its follow-up was created in Sweden during the Eras Tour with pop geniuses Max Martin and Shellback &#8212; who helped create some of Swift’s most enduring pop smashes from the mid-2010s, and who hadn’t worked with her in eight years &#8212; the expectation of wall-to-wall bangers that Swift set seemed attainable, given their skills and shared history. The timing for a return to anthemic pop felt right, too: with Swift recently engaged to NFL star Travis Kelce and the Eras tour conquering the world, a full-length celebration seemed to be in order. And while The Life of a Showgirl is composed of classically designed pop tracks, with standard verse-chorus arrangements a…",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

Specs include an LED light source, 1080p resolution, 500 ANSI lumens, HDR10/HLG support, and built-in Google TV and Netflix. The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",

Samsung’s rollout of One UI 8 is catching up in pace. While it is much more timely compared to its laggard One UI 7 rollout, it feels like a mere version upgrade with few changes. However, to ensure we have no complaints, it is also working on a significant update with One UI 8.5, which is expected to arrive with the Galaxy S26 series in the coming months. We’ve already spotted nearly a dozen new features in One UI 8.5 and are learning about a quite useful addition. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could introduce partial screen recording, which would allow only a selected portion of the display to be captured and displayed in the video. The feature was spotted in a leaked One UI 8.5 test build and reported by leaker Ice Universe on Weibo .",

Alongside the newest Kindle Scribe lineup launched at its fall hardware event, Amazon announced two new reading tools: Story So Far and Ask This Book.

Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience.

New and improved Google Home app Home has become a bit sprawling in its reach over the years, but Google is now reining things in with a tight new interface designed to connect users with the most important information and controls all in one place. That involves splitting the app into the Home, Activity, and Automations tabs. Activity you’re probably familiar with from Home already, detailing all the actions your devices have been taking. To that, Google now adds handy Home Brief summaries for Home Premium subscribers.",

The Aerial button even remembers the direction from Street View when transitioning into Satellite View, enhancing the user experience. Google Maps has a ton of great features that make it one of the best navigation apps on Android . One such feature is Street View, which presents users with images of the actual street and surroundings in mapped areas. Street View allows users to explore neighborhoods virtually, but there isn’t a clean method to seamlessly transition from Street View to Satellite View (which is also useful for virtual exploration). Google could soon solve this with a new Aerial button that lets users transition from Street View to Satellite View in a matter of seconds.
