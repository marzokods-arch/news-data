Release date October 10, 2025 Expect to pay $40 Developer Supermassive Games Publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment Reviewed on RTX 3060 (laptop), Ryzen 5 5600H, 16GB RAM Steam Deck Verified Link Steam The Little Nightmares games are humble in their intent, and that’s what makes them tick. You’re a tiny weakling moving forward through a hostile world. Where are you going? You just don’t know. Why are you there? It's a dream. Why do all these trauma-inducing monstrosities want to kill you? Because you’re there. These games are not works of narrative genius and that’s entirely to their credit. They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever. In Little Nightmares 3 we can glean a lot about the sordid realities of the environments we move through, but we never learn with any certainty what that means to us, or how we fit into it.

Absolum seems to be delivering that—earlier this year I called the game one of my favorite things I've played in 2025 . Out tomorrow, I spoke with some of Absolum's developers at Dotemu about their creative process behind the cast of four: Galandra (broadsword-swinging warrior), Karl (stout dwarven brawler), Cider (the prosthetic ninja), and Brome (frog wizard). PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them. So the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture.

There are plenty of potential suspects you can point the finger at, and you have to choose one whether you've got damning evidence or not. Spoiler: you will never have damning evidence. Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it. In a chat with PCG at this year's GDC, Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said that's entirely the point. \"From the very beginning I said, 'I think that for this to be compelling in the way that I want it to be, there cannot be a right answer'\". In fact, it sounds like Sawyer himself doesn't have a clear culprit in mind for the game's evildoings. \"People on the team would ask me [who the culprit is], then people at Xbox would ask me, and I'm like, 'No! There isn't!'

But my sheer joy at the prospect of jumping into blissful chaos is also somewhat overshadowed by the rising dread that the servers simply won't be able to cope. Battlefield games have a rather unfavourable track record of borking their servers on launch as more people than expected pile in. To be fair, so do most multiplayer online games. But Battlefield 6 lead producer David Sirland seems to think all will be OK when Friday rolls around. \"Should be! We are planning for that, of course, and the open beta helped gauge the interest as well,\" Sirland said (via GamesRadar ) in response to a fan question about whether the servers would be ready. (Image credit: EA) The betas likely helped Battlefield Studios realise just how popular Battlefield 6 will be, as hundreds of thousands of players piled in to experience the joys and horrors that Iberian Offensive had to offer, and many were met with a 140,000 player queue . The other pitfall that many were nervous about Battlefield 6 falling into is releasing in an unoptimised state (like Borderlands 4 last month ). Although from wha…",

And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck.

It's intriguing for one or two other reasons, too. But let's start with that eye-popping 1,600 brightness rating. This is a mini LED monitor, not an OLED panel and it comes with a VESA DisplayHDR 1400 rating. That means it must be capable of hitting 1,400 nits, full screen. By contrast, pun intended, the brightest OLED monitors are currently rated at 1,300 nits, like the LG Ultragear 45GX950A , but can only achieve that in tiny windows measuring a percentage or two of the whole screen. In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time.

And you bet that even applies to …",

My clumsy coordination and instant panic the second I sense danger doesn't do me any favours, but I also can't ignore the fact that the dull colour palette which often accompanies some of the best FPS games , is so uninspiring it puts me off playing entirely. I figured this would always be the way, and I'd actively avoid any game that involves me wielding a firearm for the foreseeable future, until the fateful day I saw Don't Stop, Girlypop! on Steam . You could colour any game with various hues and douse it in virtual glitter and heart icons, and it would probably pique my interest in some way or another. Lucky for me, Don't Stop, Girlypop! feeds this insatiable need for all things cute and pink while disguised as an action-packed arena shooter, resulting in me feeling brave enough to actually pick up a game from the genre I've sworn to dislike. Although the demo only whisks you through a portion of the game, it's enough to get a feel for just what awaits you in this frilly, fast-paced shooter. At the start of the demo, you are introduced as Imber, a faceless yet powerful fo…",

Speaking to PCG's Ian Evenden for our upcoming issue 415 , however, creative director Dennis Lenart says it was originally designed to be a live-action series. \"We originally started in 2018,\" says Lenart. \"It was going to be a potential live-action interactive TV show.

It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",
