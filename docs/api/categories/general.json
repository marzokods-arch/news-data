Trying out beta software means accepting some level of risk, but how much do you really expect to break when running an Android beta? Maybe Google Wallet stops working? Fingerprint sensor shuts down? A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software. That may be true, but this week was apparently the exception that proves the rule, as Google was forced to pump the brakes on Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 following reports of some seriously phone-breaking glitches.

That latter addition is one we‚Äôve seen the app been giving some special attention to this year, building out tools to help you keep them current and surface the right one at the right time .

The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 ‚Äúany condition‚Äù trade-in offer.",

We‚Äôre now seeing in action a ‚ÄúSpatial‚Äù tab with media suitable for XR headsets. It is also testing a ‚ÄúGo immersive‚Äù option, which may be used to cast images to the headset directly from your phone or convert 2D images into 3D. Google‚Äôs Android XR platform is set for its big debut, with Samsung‚Äôs Project Moohan, aka Galaxy XR , likely to be the first headset to feature the interface. Ahead of the release, Google can be seen tailoring standard Android apps to run in the expansive realm. Photos, Google‚Äôs suggested app for storing all media, especially what you capture yourself, is gearing up to photos and videos on a big canvas.

Bitmoji will still be accessible generally from its website and in other apps. Gboard provides quick access to GIFs and stickers to easily attach them in any app that allows it. One of the types of stickers the app currently supports is Bitmoji, little customizable cartoons that you can make look like yourself, right down to clothes and accessories. That integration won‚Äôt be around much longer, though. Earlier this year, we spotted code in the Gboard app that made it seem like Bitmoji support would be phased out before 2026. That change is drawing near: The app is now showing users a warning that clearly says Gboard‚Äôs Bitmoji integration is ending in just a few weeks.",

Various glitches and broken routines have tested people‚Äôs patience, even among those who‚Äôve stuck by the platform from the start. Google‚Äôs hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won‚Äôt launch in India anytime soon was the final straw. Understandable as that is, his geospecific issue won‚Äôt apply to many of our readers, and the poll results below suggest that a majority of you are willing to roll the dice with Google‚Äôs smart home ecosystem at least one more time.",
