Hey, Highguard is out. I played around six hours between launch day and a preview event in Los Angeles last week. It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.

FromSoft dusted off the venerable swordsman to serve as a boss in Elden Ring Nightreign's recent Deathly Forsaken Hollows DLC. He's effectively been \"ported\" to Elden Ring's iteration of the FromSoft game engine, allowing Elden Ring Fights to pit him against the Lands Between's finest. And boy, for a battered veteran coming out of retirement, Artorias fares better than all those tomato cans they kept setting up in front of Jake Paul. Artorias went on an absolutely brutal tear through the bosses of Elden Ring: Early terrors like Margit and Godfrey don't stand a chance, with single hits from Abyss Artie chunking their health bars.

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",

Some even want to see it fail on principle alone, which is a bit harsh if you ask me. With limited marketing (non-existent, really), we'll need to wait until the Highguard launch time and release date to settle the score. Perhaps we're on the verge of one of the best FPS games . Perhaps not. Only time will tell. The good news is that Highguard is free to play, so you won't be short-changed if you're just giving it a spin out of curiosity. When is the Highguard unlock time? Highguard releases today, Monday, January 26 , at 1 pm EST. Although Wildlight Entertainment has yet to officially mention the specific time, it's backed up by the countdown on the Steam store page , syncs with the game's daily countdown social media posts , and coincides with the studio's launch showcase event livestream. Based on this, here are the full Highguard unlock times for major time zones across the globe: Pacific: 10 am PST Eastern: 1 pm EST UK: 6 pm GMT Europe: 7 pm CET Australia: 5 am AEDT (Tuesday, January 27) New Zealand: 7 am NZDT (Tue…",

Former art director Joseph Cross left the studio in Dec. 2025 after six years, and last Tuesday, he unpacked his thoughts on the online discourse around Marathon in an interview with Mikhail Klimentov of ReaderGrev . Cross told Klimentov the team felt distinct \"spells\" where talk around the game was positive at first, and then became negative. \"Personally, I'm able to compartmentalize a lot of that,\" he said in the interview. \"The art is really the most important thing to me here. It's difficult for me to take any of that stuff personally because I believe in the art, because I believe in what we've done. I think we did something really cool, and I think it will pan out.\" He added that he had no say over design or \"the way the game plays,\" but \"what I could control, I feel really good about.\" \"You can't take that away from me, as much as the haters try online or wherever,\" said Cross. \"And whether someone …",

It's remarkably crisp and feature-rich, offering a superior experience to emulation while demanding less from your computer. Some of those features include support for higher framerates, widescreen and ultrawide aspect ratios, and an extensive options menu where you can change control mappings and switch to a dual analog camera.

Now, though, things are about to get more involved with the addition of organic production chains.
