    "body": "Bad Bunny conjured the KPop Demon Hunters trio HUNTR/X during the season 51 premiere of Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4. In the six-minute sketch, fittingly titled &#8220;KPop Demon Hunters,&#8221; the Puerto Rican superstar — who hosted the episode alongside musical guest Doja Cat — plays Thomas, a brunch-goer passionately defending his love for the wildly popular animated Netflix movie. “It’s actually not for kids. It’s for smart adults,” Bad Bunny&#8217;s Thomas says to skeptical friends. “In KPop Demon Hunters, songs are not just songs. They are weapons,” he continues. “What else is gonna save you from demons, you idiot.” The sketch takes a chaotic turn when SNL cast member Bowen Yang appears as one of the film’s demons and possesses Sarah Sherman by belting out the hit song “Soda Pop.” Just in time, HUNTR/X — voiced in the movie by EJAE, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna — arrive to save the day, performing their smash single “Golden” and vanquishing the demon. The sketch marked the first-ever live televised performance of “Golden,” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks. HUNTR/X is slated to deliver their first full-length live performance of the song on The Tonight Show St…",

On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift&#8217;s biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele’s 25 , which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2&nbsp;million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department , sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Luminate’s sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard ’s charts. All numbers in this story are for the U.S. only.
