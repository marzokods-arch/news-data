    "body": "It’s impossible to deny Taylor Swift ’s impact on music. With hundreds of songs and dozens of hits, she&#8217;s a master singer-songwriter with countless awards – including the only artist to win the album of the year at the Grammys four times. But a music career isn’t only about music — it’s about the visual execution too. And though the age-old saying “don’t judge a book by its cover” is generally true, an album cover can play a big role in making it memorable.
