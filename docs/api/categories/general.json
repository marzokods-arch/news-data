In an appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday, Sharon detailed the last conversation she had with Ozzy, who died at 76 on July 22. She told Morgan that Ozzy was &#8220;up and down to the bathroom all night&#8221; and around 4:30 in the morning he asked her to &#8220;wake up!&#8221; Sharon said she responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m already bloody awake! You&#8217;ve woken me up!&#8221; Then, in a heartbreakingly sweet moment, she said Ozzy asked her to &#8220;kiss me&#8230; Hug me tight,&#8221; which was the last thing he said to her before dying later that day. &#8220;If only I&#8217;d have told him I loved him more,&#8221; she said of the regret she felt after Ozzy&#8217;s passing. &#8220;If only I&#8217;d have held him tighter.&#8221; Ozzy lived through the night and Sharon said he woke up the next day and went downstairs for his daily workout, dying a half hour later.

With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features.

West has enjoyed a bountiful breakthrough, culminating in his signing with the independent music publisher, announced Thursday, Dec. 11. Hailing from Sydney, West’s throwback, soulful sounds have drawn favorable comparisons to the likes of Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers, and, despite being at such an early stage of his career, he has captured close to 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Just last month, West cracked the ARIA Albums Chart at No. 25 with his debut Give Me All Your Love , co-written by and Nathan Hawes (Kesmar, Surely Shirley, Lazywax) and produced entirely by Hawes. “Don is effortlessly cool and charismatic. His deep-rooted love of classic soul and blues, combined with his coastal upbringing, has shaped a sound that’s resonating with audiences around the world,” comments Briese Abbott, Kobalt’s head of creative services Australia &amp; New Zealand. His songwriting “feels instantly familiar, nostalgic yet contemporary, and inherently inviting,” Abbott remarks. West made strides with his debut self-titled six-track EP, released last November, and embarked on a debut national headline tour…",

When Swift dropped by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, Dec. 10, the outgoing host asked the pop superstar to name her top five TayTay songs. Tough call, even for Swift. With that quiz, Swift joined the esteemed company of Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. All of them are inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. For Swift, it’s just a matter of time before she gets the Rock Hall call. Swift, however, struggled to complete her task. “This is so much pressure,” she told the Colbert. “You’re already writing five.” Party pooper alert: the “Shake It Off” singer requested a “little time to get back to” Colbert for the definitive list. “Because I don’t have enough, see,” she continued. “I think I require a little bit of time to like, appreciate my work in a way… and it’s constantly changing, right. It’s a little too soon.” Swift was able to select her first choice, “All Too Well,” the 10-minute version, which was released as part of the re-recorded Red (Taylor&#8217;s Version) from November 2021. “I’m really obsessed with The Life of a Showgirl righ…",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority The Pixel’s thermometer is one of those features that doesn’t come with a clear job description. It’s not like a camera or a fingerprint reader, where you instantly know why it’s part of your device. It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

These sliders let you adjust shadow levels, brightness, and white balance before taking a photo. Now, Google has made a small change to these sliders. Earlier this year, the Pixel Camera 10.1 update switched the places of the shadow and highlight sliders.

    "body": "TL;DR A new menu found in the latest Android Canary build reveals the UI for a game controller remapping feature likely coming in Android 17. Found under Bluetooth settings, the “Game Controller settings” page allows users to customize inputs for both buttons (“Keys”) and directional sticks (“Axes”). The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete. Thanks to a recent Canary release, however, I’m now able to demo what the UI for Android’s game controller remapping feature looks like.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.

Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models.
