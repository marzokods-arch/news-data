Trips to Europe while producing tours under the auspices of Knitting Factory — the avant music club he opened near CBGB in Lower Manhattan in 1987 — refined his tastes. &#8220;All of a sudden, I was relishing being in Europe, trying more wine,&#8221; he says, adding that, &#8220;the bells went off on a trip with my wife to Montrachet after the MIDEM convention. I was like, &#8216;this is sublime.&#8217; I drank the Kool-Aid and caught the bug.&#8221; In 2008, about six years after walking away from Knitting Factory, Dorf channeled his obsession with vino craftsmanship and opened his first City Winery on Varick Street in Manhattan&#8217;s SoHo district &#8212; a space featuring performances by a procession of enduring artists that included Ian Hunter , Alejandro Escovedo , Joe Ely , Willie Nile , Graham Parker and Graham Nash .

    "summary": "Breaking down the rare instances of songs returning to the chart in the top 10.",
    "body": "Billboard Hot 100 re-entries are a relatively common occurrence, as songs often experience sudden gains in activity that help them return to the chart. But re-entering in the top 10 is much rarer. In fact, in the Hot 100&#8217;s history, which dates to 1958, only 12 songs have re-entered the chart in the top 10. Generally, songs make steady runs up and down the Hot 100, though in more recent years it’s become more common for titles to debut at high ranks thanks to splashy streaming starts and then decline, with many also regaining their footing on the chart as their radio airplay solidifies. Per Hot 100 rules , to re-enter after having graduated to recurrent status, a song must garner enough chart points, with a notable reason for its resurgence. This is all to say that, for older titles, it&#8217;s generally difficult to re-enter the Hot 100 and compete with newer songs generating hefty radio airplay and streaming figures. It&#8217;s even tougher to suddenly re-enter in the top 10. The select songs that have achieved the feat of re-entering the Hot 100 in the top 10 have, for the most part, gained newfound interest after artists were prominently in the news, performed on massive …",

While the song itself is breezier indie-rock in the mold of his &#8220;Sundress&#8221; track, the visual brings the chaos of punk rock. Rocky throws a rager in his garage and is greeted by the girl next door, played by actress Winona Ryder. In the clip, an angry juicehead rushes to Rocky&#8217;s garage and disposes of Rocky and his friends (who contain references to previous Rocky projects TESTING , &#8220;Babushka Boi&#8221; and &#8220;RIOT&#8221;) one by one in brutal fashion.
