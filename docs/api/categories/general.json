It's fine. It's fine. I'm just waiting for the good Lord to take me. One thing I do understand, though, is The Simpsons, which I was the right age to catch (at least as re-runs) back when it was still good. So even I raised an eyebrow, perhaps two, when leaks began swirling that the entire town of Springfield would be back in map form in Fortnite (via VGC ). That's per Fortnite Nostradamus/Deepthroat/leaks-person-of-note NotPalo , who wrote that Fortnite would be getting a cel-shaded map with separate sections for areas like the Springfield nuclear power plant. There'll also be Simpsons character skins (with, it's said, their own Lego versions for use in Lego maps), and a Simpsons-themed mini-season. Which is all very lovely, but let's cut to the chase.

    "body": "That AMD is planning a dual-die Ryzen CPU with added 3D V-Cache goodness on not just one but both CPU core tiles has been rumoured for some time . But now we have apparent further details of the chip, including naming and claimed clockspeeds. Oh, and there's an updated and higher-clocked single-die V-Cache Ryzen chip, too, to sit above the existing Ryzen 7 9800X3D. According to X leaker chi11eddog , up front and centre we have the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D2, a 200 W, 16 core, 32 thread beast of a CPU. In really simple terms, it's similar to the the existing Ryzen 9 9950X3D . But as the rather ungainly \"2\" tacked onto the end of the model name implies, it gets another slab of 3D V-Cache added to the second CPU tile, otherwise known in AMD parlance as a CCD or Core Complex Die.

    "body": "The MSI MAG Z890 Tomahawk WiFi has been on the market for 12 months, as it was one of the first motherboards to be released alongside Intel's Core Ultra 200S range of desktop CPUs, aka Arrow Lake, in October 2024. At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker. The Z890 Tomahawk WiFi sits near the top-end of the MAG pile, partly because of its price tag, but mostly because of the comprehensive array of features it has. That's because, as its name suggests,…",

This and other vital lessons come courtesy of Victoria 3, which is celebrating its third birthday with a few statistics, as has become fashionable . Turns out players are either incredibly bad farmers or incredibly efficient murderers, because in the last 12 months they've starved enough people to death to denude real-life Earth of humans 107 million times over. But it was all worth it, because in the same timespan our plucky players managed to create anarchist Prussia 1,476 times, which is surely deeply distressing if you're Otto von Bismarck and deeply heartening if you are Gustav Landauer. Also, if you are either of those people, welcome back. All this was accomplished in a total of 440,377,653 hours of play, which equals out to about 1.1 billion deaths an hour if my maths is right.

You want to know if you can hook up with any of the immortal bloodsuckers and find romance in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 . I've got good news and bad news. In the World of Darkness, the universe in which Vampire: The Masquerade is contained, romance is kinda complicated. More complicated than usual, I mean. This is because vamps aren't human. Like Phyre themself says, the Beast—the demonic apex predator inside every vampire—hollows them out, removing human emotions like love. With that bit of lore in mind, let's dig in. Can you romance NPCs in Bloodlines 2? (Image credit: Paradox) There is what The Chinese Room calls \"romantic feeding\" in Bloodlines 2, but if you're looking for traditional RPG romance systems then you're out of luck. While vampires can retain some of their humanity—which there's a system for in both the tabletop game and Bloodlines 1, but not the sequel—in most cases their former nature gets squeezed out by the Beast, the source of all their darker proclivities.

Every night, the primogens of Seattle's vampire clans sit around in their havens, waiting for you, Sheriff Phyre, to come and solve things that one of their goons should be handling. The absolute best you can hope for is some murder, being sent to kill a human in need of a beatdown or a ghoul who's gotten too big for its britches.

I definitely recommend checking out for yourself, if that popularity has piqued your interest. As I said in my review, Ball X Pit is \"a roller coaster ride of ball-bouncing action that loves to break its own rules\". It combines Breakout-inspired action with Vampire Survivors-like roguelike progression and even a substantial city-building element between runs, and the result is an absolutely deadly 'one more run' effect.

Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake.

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself.

In my 92/100 review I practiced no restraint at all. \"In some ways N++ feels like the end of the action platformer,\" I wrote, \"like an exhaustive final document, a catalogue of its emotional highs and lows.\" I stand by those words mostly because, ten years later, I still play N++ occasionally. There's nothing else that scratches the same itch. And with over 4,000 levels—not including user-made levels—It's so big that I doubt I'll ever finish it. But that doesn't mean I'm not excited for Ten++, which is a sizeable new update adding even more levels I doubt I'll ever finish. The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\".

    "body": "Welcome to the PC Gamer Top 100—our annual list of the best games you can play right now. For the last few months, the PC Gamer team has been busy whittling down the hundreds of thousands of games available on PC; campaigning, voting and arguing until we arrived at the 100 games you'll find below. It's a list designed to represent the passion of our global team of over 30 writers and editors. If you're wondering why Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is back on the list for the first time in years, it's because Josh made a fully animated powerpoint presentation that he delivered to the team while dressed up as a pirate. Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic—a game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece—the pinnacle of its chosen genre? In truth, the answer is that can be any or al…",

However, the NV head honcho also had some comments to make on China's role within AI development, and Nvidia's efforts to sell its AI hardware within the country—along with some commentary on US trade policy between the two. \"It's important to be mindful that what harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,\" said Huang (via Wccftech ). \"And so before we leap towards policies that are hurtful to other people, take a step back and maybe reflect on what are the policies that are helpful to America.\" \"China has about 50% of the world's AI researchers, incredible schools, incredible focus in AI, lots of passion around AI. And I think it's a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology,\" he continued. \"We are 100% out of China… we went from 95% market share to 0%, and so I can't imagine any policy maker thinking that's a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world.\" Certainly, Nvidia looks to have found…",

    "body": "Looks like we're getting six more weeks of, uh, summer? Marvel star Simu Liu has seen his shadow and returned for his bi-annual Sleeping Dogs movie update. After telling fans (in the form of a random guy on X) that he was still working on translating United Front Games' magnum opus to the silver screen, he's returned to tell us the draft of its script is officially complete. The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on—if you've somehow forgotten—2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far. Liu says that's not the case, though. \"[Square Enix is]…",
