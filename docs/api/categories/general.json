When you don't invest in gameplay, you don't just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.\" Hytale was \"barely playable\" when he reassumed control, Collins-Laflamme said, and all the game's basic systems were broken: \"Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering.

    "body": "Baba is You is about as cool as puzzle games get, and PC Gamer contributor Philippa Warr agreed, scoring the game an exceptional 90% back when it released . But like most puzzle games, I binged it once with no plans to return until my withering hippocampus had fully lost all the puzzle solutions. To my elation, 2026 is starting with a delightful surprise: a major update to Baba Is You with all sorts of new words, objects and modding tools. The update is detailed in a Steam community blog post , which reasons \"This will most probably be the final large update for BIY.\" It seems to be primarily targeted at modders, but contains five new words for use in custom levels: become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. If you've never played Baba is You, words change the way a given level works as you construct condition-altering sentences. For instance, Baba is Happy would theoretically make the player character happy… what effect that would have on a puzzle, I'm not sure. There's also a bunch of new sprites, including a fox, a bean, a hot dog, a cactus, and so on. This is all tailor-made for Baba's detailed (and cross-platform!) level editor, which was released back in 2021 . If you haven't …",

As a little bonus for tuning in, you can grab three livestream codes to redeem for some extra Primogems. This time around, character-wise, we can expect Hydro five-star Columbina, Geo five-star Zibai, and Geo four-star Illuga. There will also apparently be reruns for Neuvillette and Ineffa, though this isn't certain until the stream.

This time around, New Blood is promising the game's biggest explorable area yet, which means it's a great time to try all those spooky new toys. The Hightown Update comes after a short delay, but dropped just in time for a New Year's Day celebration. The release trailer shows off some of the new areas and a new weapon: a revolver with a rifle stock and a scope slapped on. A teaser blog post on Steam said the new patch contains both \"largest, most vertical open area\" and \"the most sophisticated, lethal and complex enemy force\" yet seen in Gloomwood, and shows off more of the new areas, which look suitably gothic and dismal. Back when the patch was delayed around Christmas, developer Dillon Rogers said on X that the new revolver-rifle would help players \"tackle those pesky constable snipers.\" My experience with Gloomwood is limited, but I do love a stealth game with winding, open s…",

A highlight of the series is the arresting performance from lead actor Rhea Seehorn, who plays one of the only normal humans left after most of the world suddenly merges into an eerily polite gestalt consciousness. Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

Looking back on a year of hardware reviews, plenty of premium bits of kit didn't impress me much—especially when each penny has felt especially precious in recent years. So, setting the coveted category awards aside, it's definitely tricky to pick one techie thing that really spoke to me this year. That said, it's not like I don't have some cracking options to choose from for my personal pick. Could it be the Razer Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , the kitty-eared gaming headset that's just as much a fashion statement as it is a really premium audio device? Or is my personal hardware pick the Be Quiet! Light Mount , the quietest gaming keyboard anyone at PCG towers has had the pleasure of tinkling the keys of? Nope, it's a gamepad you can buy for less than $30 / £25 .

That's pretty much a wrap on 2025, but we're not letting the year slip away without taking one more fond look back. No, not at the best games of the year—we've already done our GOTYs —but at the best patch notes of the year. Every game, no matter how much we love it, needs a little post-launch work, and sometimes the little bugs and glitches a game ships with can be kinda funny. Funnier still, occasionally, are the solutions to the problems. 2025 was no exception. Here's a little quiz where I'll show you a bizarre patch note, and you guess what game it's from. It's multiple choice, so it shouldn't be too hard, but there may be a few surprising answers in there, too. Happy New Year, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

It just shows off the game's \"game over\" screen, which sounds like the sort of thing that wouldn't be all that noteworthy, but the song slaps . Funky synth bass and warped, echoing samples glide over hip hop drums; it's the sort of dance-worthy defeat screen that salves the sting of losing in a frenzied arcade game. And if you haven't given Mindwave's demo a shot, that's exactly what it is. PC Gamer's Elie Gould sang the demo's praises in their impressions piece on it, and I similarly came away from it foaming at the mouth to play the full game. It's a chaotic mishmash of what WarioWare originally coined as \"micro-games\": dead simple minigames that you have mere seconds to complete, played one after another at mach speeds. It differentiates itself from the Nintendo series by being a bit more narrative; the Steam page bills it as \"…",

If you haven't played Trine, it's a The Lost Vikings-style puzzle platformer with three characters: a bumbling but burly knight, a thief with grappling hooks and a bow, and a wizard who can generate cubes and platformers. In solo play, you can only control one character at a time, but in multiplayer, all three characters are on screen at once.

It's big. Which is why it was a real shame that the launches of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs this year were such a nightmare. Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too.

To me, a soulslike isn't about how chunky the dodge roll is or whether you have a stamina bar—it's about the slow, tense exploration of a dangerous world. It's about deliberate and hard-won mastery over mechanics and, more to the point: It's about the boss fights, baby.

Thanks to YouTube user isfooPoE , we now know its possible to kill some of the toughest bosses in the game without wearing a single piece of gear. Loot is king in PoE 2, as it is in any other action RPG, but it's also apparently optional if you're playing a monk with the power to shock bosses in one swift strike. IsfooPoE's build requires nothing but a set of unarmed skills that do a surprising amount of damage without any items to supplement them. Their fight against Arbiter of Ash is mighty impressive to watch, mostly because it's the clearest example of the soulslike bones in PoE 2. IsfooPoE dodge-rolls out of the bosses swings like they're in a FromSoftware game. The boss has the power to set the entire room on fire and it still can't land many hits on a dude wearing nothing but a t-shirt and pants. The high damage largely comes from a skill that triggers lightning strikes when you dash. Those lightning strikes then explode the ice walls isfooPoE puts around the boss. It's a simple combo that d…",

    "body": "If you haven't played Fallen Aces , I highly recommend it whether you're a dedicated immsim sicko or an FPS greenhorn. It's Dishonored by way of Dick Tracy: an immediate and stylish neo-noir FPS dripping with pulpy comic art and a tantalizingly interactive goon sandbox. And that's just the first episode, which launched into early access last year . Fans have been eagerly awaiting the second episode since then, but a development update on Steam confirmed yesterday that it won't hit its old release window of \"before the end of 2025.\" That said, it did share some exciting details, as well as a brief teaser. The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas. If nothing else, it seems like the second episode will lean in even harder to the over-the-top comic book action. The rest of the update shows off some new areas, story comics, and teases Delia, a \"fully controllable NPC companion\" that responds to commands like \"move there,\" \"stay here,\" and \"shoot that fuckin' guy!\" It looks…",

GOG always had you covered when you got an itch to play some old '90s shooter that you lost the CD key to long ago. And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",
