Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart.

    "body": "TL;DR XREAL has announced the XREAL 1S, a replacement for its XREAL One AR glasses. The 1S glasses come with higher-resolution displays, a wider field of view, and more improvements. XREAL also announced the XREAL Neo, a combination battery pack and video hub, to go with the XREAL 1S. XREAL is a big player in the burgeoning AR glasses space, and today, ahead of CES, the company’s announcing a “mid-generation refresh” for its XREAL One glasses from late 2024. The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",

Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

I didn’t have to plan ahead and carry my mirrorless cam and long-range zoom with me anymore, nor did I have to spend hours editing, stacking, and coloring photos to get the effect I wanted. In 2024, I shot over 5000+ photos with my Pixel 8 and 9, and shared with you the best ones . I’m back in 2025, having carried my Pixel 9 Pro XL and 10 Pro XL through Paris, Budapest, Avignon, Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague, Mulhouse, Colmar, Bruges, Oostende, Athens, and beyond. I shot another 5000+ photos this year, and sifting through them was, once again, the most grueling end-of-year task.

Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series.

We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera.

Each time I did that, I performed the same action on my old phone: Go to settings, find the factory reset option, and tap it. Simple, right? But in the past few years, I started noticing something a little different. It seemed like my old phone didn’t dissociate from my Google account entirely, and there were remnants of it in a few places. I recently started looking into these and realized something: There’s a crucial step I should always do before factory resetting any Android phone, and I’ve been skipping it for years.",

These toggles will be part of the Camera Assistant Good Lock app, rather than the base Camera app on One UI. Both of these features are currently unavailable and could be intended for the Galaxy S26 Ultra to mark it as a high-end tool for camera enthusiasts. Leaks so far paint a disappointing picture for the Galaxy S26 , but Samsung seems to have grander plans for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. While the camera hardware may remain unchanged for yet another year, Samsung could be working on enhancing the camera experience with features such as reduced lens flare , support for professional lens controllers , APV codec , and more. Now you can add two more upcoming features to the list: video softening, autofocus speed, and sensitivity.

Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form.

The new modem is very similar to the old one, but offers improved efficiency and more robust satellite capabilities. Samsung announced the Exynos 2600 processor earlier this month, and it’s expected to power some Galaxy S26 models. We know that the Exynos 2600 will be paired with an external modem, but Samsung has just announced a new modem that will apparently be paired with the processor. Samsung quietly listed the Exynos Modem 5410 on its website (h/t: r/Android ), and a leaker previously claimed that this will be the modem in all Exynos-powered Galaxy S26 variants. So what makes this modem stand out from the Exynos Modem 5400?",

    "body": "TL;DR The Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL can now run Android 16 through official support in LineageOS 23, years after Google ended updates. The update is based on Android 16’s initial release, not newer QPR builds, so some later features aren’t included. Installing LineageOS requires unlocking the phone and manually installing new software, which may not suit everyone. That relic of a device that’s gathering dust in your drawer might still have a lease of life in it yet. Google officially stopped updating the Pixel 4 back in 2022, but the phone is now getting Android 16 anyway — just not from Google. As spotted by Android Police, the LineageOS team has officially added support for the Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL as part of LineageOS 23 . The Pixel 4a, 4a 5G, Pixel 5, and Pixel 5a are also now supported. That’s the project’s Android 16-based release, and the “official” status means the maintainers consider it stable enough for everyday use, with core features working as expected.",

OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",
