It wasn't until the in-game recipe book was introduced in 2018 that I no longer had to rely on the internet to tell me what I needed, but by this point the crafting guide wasn't needed.

Now, another joins their number: Danny Trejo, Hollywood actor and, as of recently, Bethesda reply guy. Bethesda was making all manner of hullabaloo about its Fallout Day celebration in the run-up to the event. That includes, of course, social media posts. One day before the event, Bethesda posted a reminder to its Instagram, urging fans to tune in for announcements and merch drops about Fallout 76 and Fallout 4. Our Danny wasn't distracted. He was in there like a flash on his official Danny Trejo Instagram account: \"Remaster New Vegas boss! 🔥\" our hero demanded , right there in Todd Howard's backyard. At time of writing, it's the most-liked comment on the post, with 50 replies pretty much all saying some variant of 'Hell yeah'. Trejo speaks for a whole bunch of fans.

According to Schafer, whose acclaimed adventure game studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2019, Spencer and the software giant have been true to their word, at least in his experience. \"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'\" Schafer said. \"And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.' And that's been true all these years … You know, creatively, we can be like, 'Hey, we want to make this game about a walking lighthouse,' and they're like, 'Cool.

Without spoiling anything here myself, I'll just say the main issue seemed to be about how abrupt it felt and that certain characters behaved in a way that didn't line up with the rest of the story. Basically, Hades 2 had a surprisingly tidy ending for a story about messy gods. The negative reactions must've been strong enough to prompt developer Supergiant Games to start working on a way to contextualize—not change—the ending.

The work of a Redditor who goes by the call sign veloci_official , this powering-up solution involves a pair of flip switches and key activator as gateway keepers to the all-important \"Start\" button which is, of course, housed beneath a clear, flip-up cover. Each element sports an all-caps label—POWER, FUEL, IGNITION, START—fitted slightly askew for a pleasing DIY-come-military vibe. The flip switches and turn-key are, in effect, only contact switches that act to enable the \"Start\" button. In other words, once the PC is running, an accidental knock of one of those switches or a twitch of the key won't do anything other than make the Start button inoperable, thereby making accidental shutdowns, perhaps courtesy of a passing feline, far less likely.

All three have been heavily involved in The Sims community and the developer itself for a number of years—they've all contributed towards packs either through creating lots or collaborating on kits like Plumbella's Pastel Pop Kit and lilsimsie's Comfy Gamer Kit. James Turner has created all manner of tools and mods over the years too, as well as formerly running custom content website The Sim Supply.

That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on.
