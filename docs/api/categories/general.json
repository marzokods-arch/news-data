The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

Orders start October 19 at 8 PM PT, although full pricing and specs are not yet available. The Game Boy Advance SP was the original clamshell EDC, and countless gaming handhelds have been chasing that high ever since. Earlier this year, the Miyoo Flip tried and mostly failed due to a seriously compromised hinge design. Now the company is back with an even smaller version, and hopefully it’s learned from the previous release. The Miyoo Mini Flip has the same 2.8-inch screen as 2021’s Miyoo Mini, but apart from that, the company hasn’t announced specs or pricing. It’s almost certainly going to be a low-powered Linux device, most likely topping off at PS1 emulation.",

Google Wallet is far more than just a place to keep your credit cards, and the app has evolved into a digital card hub that’s truly worthy of its name, carrying everything from travel passes to loyalty cards. That latter addition is one we’ve seen the app been giving some special attention to this year, building out tools to help you keep them current and surface the right one at the right time .

The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.

    "body": "As with every Google Pixel launch, this year’s Pixel 10 series has been no stranger to criticism, with much of it directed at the Pixel 10’s poor specs. Compared to flagships from Samsung, OnePlus, and others, there’s plenty to critique about the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro . The Pixel 10 lineup doesn’t stand out for its amazing battery life. Google isn’t pushing any boundaries with its wired charge speeds. And, perhaps the hottest point of contention, the Tensor G5 chip just isn’t as powerful as its Snapdragon and MediaTek rivals.",

The team estimates a total cost of $40.47 million, higher than the approximate $26 million needed for flagship hardware. By using AOSP instead of starting from zero, Nothing saves time, money, and gains full access to Google’s ecosystem. Ever wondered what it takes to build a custom operating system from scratch? In its latest collaboration with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss, Nothing takes a closer look at what it truly costs to build a new operating system from the ground up. The video, which aimed to create a custom OS for Arun Maini, breaks down every stage of the process, from planning to deployment, and reveals that developing a fully functional mobile OS would cost an eye-watering $40.47 million. As the video highlights, that figure is even higher than the estimated $26 million it would take to produce the hardware of a flagship phone, as shown in the duo’s earlier Dream Phone project .",

According to the report, there will not be a Galaxy S26 Edge. Instead, Samsung will stick to its tried-and-tested lineup of Galaxy S26 (Pro), S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. A previous report had suggested that Samsung has already resumed development on the Galaxy S26 Plus. Samsung took a giant leap of faith with the Galaxy S25 Edge , a flagship smartphone that was ready to compromise on some core specifications in the pursuit of a thin and light body. The Korean company one-upped Apple before it could launch the iPhone Air , and even several other Android OEMs before they could jump onto the thin-and-light bandwagon. However, it’s no surprise that the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t selling well, and the latest report out of South Korea indicates that Samsung has already canceled its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge.

The smartphone is now available for pre-order in the US and will cost $999 when it launches early next year. It packs a 5,000mAh battery, a triple-rear camera setup, 16GB of RAM, and a MediaTek chipset. There’s a lot of talk about de-Googling these days. The movement essentially advocates cutting Google’s access to private information on people’s devices. That’s why many privacy-focused operating systems, like GrapheneOS , are gaining traction among users who want to avoid Google’s tracking and data collection and protect their information from reaching the wrong hands. Now, a new smartphone called the HIROH Phone is promising all those things, and it even adds a hardware kill switch for extra peace of mind.",
