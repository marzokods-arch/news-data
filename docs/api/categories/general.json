    "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia &#8212; Oasis won’t look back in anger at their first visit to Australia in two decades. The Britpop era superstars on Tuesday, Nov. 4 wrapped up the Melbourne leg of their swing down under, a three-concert stand at Marvel Stadium which produced three sellouts, playing to 180,000 fans, reps say. The rock ‘n’ roll stars have made themselves at home, and made their feeling clear on dodgy ticket resales, which didn&#8217;t materialize due to the state of Victoria&#8217;s tough anti-touting laws . Under those rules, tickets can’t be resold for more than 10 per cent above the face value, or face fines from A$908 to A$109,044 for individuals or A$545,220 to A$545,000 for corporations. The Oasis tour was listed as a “major event,” and with it was protected under the&nbsp; Major Events Act 2009. As a result, those fans were guarded from paying obscene fees through StubHub or Viagogo, which remains one of live entertainment industry’s mortal enemies. Oasis has applauded the intervention. “It’s great to see Victoria’s Major Events Declaration doing exactly what it’s meant to — Viagogo can’t list our Melbourne shows — and that’s a huge win for real fans,&#8221; reads a s…",

Rolling Loud Australia is set to take place across two cities in March: Sydney’s Centennial Park on March 7, and Melbourne’s Flemington Racecourse on March 8.

In the nearly three-minute-long track , DY returns to his roots spitting bars and rhymes over a reggaetón drum. The electric beat speeds up at some points for that rhythmic DY approach, reminiscent of previous hits, including &#8220;Llamada de Emergencia.&#8221; In the Biza-produced session, he sings about that positive essence that&#8217;s guiding his latest projects. &#8220;If you ask me, I owe nothing to anyone,&#8221; DY sings. &#8220;When I leave here, I won&#8217;t take anything with me, I will just leave [feeling] true love, my feet on the ground, always looking up at the sky.&#8221; Related Daddy Yankee Says He&#8217;s &#8216;Still Under Construction&#8217; During Superstar Q&amp;A at 2025 Latin Music&nbsp;Week Bizarrap &amp; Daddy Yankee T…",
