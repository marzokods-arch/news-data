I've got bigger and better things to make poor financial decisions about than videogames. Where I can be convinced, though, is when the game costs nary more than a cup of coffee or a sweet treat from that fancy bakery down the street. My five dollar coffee only lasts me 15 minutes, what does it matter if this five dollar videogame has the same staying power?

And... that's it. That's the entire basis for the first PC Gamer quiz of 2026. Sorry. I'll make more of an effort for the rest of the year, I promise. The fact that Doom and Dune sound alike isn't the end of the similarities, though. They're both cherished science fiction series, they're both books, movies, and games, and they both feature a protagonist who wears armor that might be full of bodily fluids. So despite the paper-thin premise, this is actually a great idea for a quiz! Right? I'll keep it simple, though: the answer to every question in today's quiz is Doom , Dune , Both , or Neither . That's it! I'll give you a prompt, and you tell me if it's true of Doom, Dune, both of them, or neither. Good luck, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

Spoiler alert, it's the Arctic Freezer 36 , going for a seriously impressive price tag that rests comfortably under $50. Still though, it's hard to ignore just how expensive PC gaming continues to be. With the memory pricing apocalypse upon us, not to mention how it's set to carry on into 2026 and beyond , a bit of kit's value proposition is never far from our minds.

There's no release window yet, but a recent Kickstarter update dropped on Dec. 28 alongside a new trailer that had me perplexed at first and sold about 15 seconds in. It just shows off the game's \"game over\" screen, which sounds like the sort of thing that wouldn't be all that noteworthy, but the song slaps . Funky synth bass and warped, echoing samples glide over hip hop drums; it's the sort of dance-worthy defeat screen that salves the sting of losing in a frenzied arcade game. And if you haven't given Mindwave's demo a shot, that's exactly what it is. PC Gamer's Elie Gould sang the demo's praises in their impressions piece on it, and I similarly came away from it foaming at the mouth to play the full game. It's a chaotic mishmash of what WarioWare originally coined as \"micro-games\": dead simple minigames that you have mere seconds to complete, played one after another at mach speeds. It differentiates itself from the Nintendo series by being a bit more narrative; the Steam page bills it as \"…",

If you already own the game, nothing changes—it will remain available in your Steam library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.\" Though not as popular as colorful spinoff River City Girls , the game sits at a \"mostly positive\" user review rating on Steam . I haven't played Underground myself just yet, but I have played the original NES game; it's one of the better action games on the system that I've tried.

Now, when you boot up Trine 1 through 4 on Steam, you'll be prompted to optionally link your Steam and Epic accounts for cross-platform friend invites and achievement progress. The series' headlining feature is its three-player co-op, so this should make playing with anyone who just got the games due to this promotion easier. If you haven't played Trine, it's a The Lost Vikings-style puzzle platformer with three characters: a bumbling but burly knight, a thief with grappling hooks and a bow, and a wizard who can generate cubes and platformers. In solo play, you can only control one character at a time, but in multiplayer, all three characters are on screen at once.

When a whole new generation of graphics cards is going to drop, it energises the entire PC gaming hardware industry; people are going to upgrade, new laptops will arrive, and companies will refresh their entire PC lineups. It's big. Which is why it was a real shame that the launches of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs this year were such a nightmare. Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too. Just in time for the RAMpocalypse to strike and push prices up on anything that has any little bit of memory inside it. Hint: that means everything.

And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard .
