Dropping at midnight, “Beat Yourself Up” is brassy, bass-y, catchy, and could’ve stepped right out of a time when the Detroit Pistons were beating everyone up in the NBA, and muscles ruled Hollywood. “Beat Yourself Up” is housed by the singer and songwriter’s forthcoming studio album, Whatever’s Clever! (via Atlantic Records), due out on March 27. The fresh cut “started as something I wanted to tell a friend,” the award-winning artist explains. “We’ve never been the heart-to-heart types, so I wrote it in a song instead,” he continues. “I wanted to tell him that even though he has made mistakes along the way, he shouldn’t be so hard on himself. That things will get better and he’s not alone.” It&#8217;s the second track lifted from his forthcoming album, following &#8220;Changes,&#8221; which arrived last October , coupled with his baby news. While writing &#8220;Beat Yourself Up,&#8221; he continues, “I soon realized this wasn’t just for my friend but myself and so many others who can be hard on themselves. It’s a message to keep going and be kinder to yourself.&#8221; “Beat Yourself Up…",

According to a statement, the new release marks the group’s “most immersive and narratively driven chapter to date,” a concept album that specifically takes a big bite into vampire mythology. “The album follows an unprecedented escape of vampire lovers, tracing the fragile balance between desire and consequence in a world bound by unbreakable rules,” reads the release. This is no ordinary collection of works from JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO and NI-KI. From start to finish, the 11-track collection blends music, narration, and cinematic storytelling, with songs meshed with narration and skits.
