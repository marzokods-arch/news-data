The feature, initially available to Samsung users via the Good Lock module Lockstar, became more widely available with One UI 8 and is set for another upgrade with One UI 8.5 . But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended.

We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

A new “don’t ask me again” checkbox allows the system to remember your preference for specific monitors. This streamlines the setup process, removing the need to dig through Settings to switch between mirroring and desktop modes. With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , certain Pixel phones gained more flexibility when connected to an external display. Rather than being restricted to simple screen mirroring, they can now project a desktop-like interface via Android’s new Desktop Mode . While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it. Without these peripherals, controlling apps becomes difficult unless your external display has a touchscreen. In these cases, screen mirroring remains the better option, as it allows you to navigate using your phone while viewing content on the big screen.",

Earlier this year, we saw signs that two of those methods were growing closer together — and now, that project is finally rolling out broadly. Back in May , we got our first glimpse at how Circle to Search-like functionality would play out in Gemini. In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for. The implementation rolling out now saves a step: after calling up Gemini, you just draw a circle around the part of your screen you want to share.",

Released in 2024, it was one of the most powerful “small” handhelds, with an 8 Gen 2 SoC and PSP Vita vibes. AYN still sells the Odin 2, as well as the Odin 2 Portal, Thor, and Odin 3. When it comes to smaller Android gaming handhelds with enough power for demanding systems, your options are surprisingly limited. The Odin 2 Mini was one of the first to really fill that niche, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 packed into a relatively small frame with a 5-inch screen. But now, that device is no longer on the market. Confirmed by a representative on Discord , the AYN Odin 2 Mini has been discontinued and removed from the company’s website. This was not announced in advance, nor was it made public on any of the company’s channels.",
