The software brings several key improvements, like expressive design, enhanced protection against malicious apps, and more transparent background activities. Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 8, based on Android 16, to the Galaxy S25 series . But Samsung isn’t the only brand rolling out the new Android OS to its devices this week. Motorola is also getting the ball rolling with a couple of its handsets. The stable version of Android 16 is starting to arrive on some Motorola phones. The first devices getting the software are the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (via YTECHB ) and the Edge 50 Fusion (via Gizmochina ). On top of that, it seems the release is only happening in specific markets at the moment, which include Brazil for the Edge 60 Pro and Mexico for the Edge 50 Fusion. It appears Motorola is taking a phased approach to its rollout before the broader release.",

Smartphones may be our bread and butter, but we are absolute suckers around here for a nice handheld gaming console — so we were understandably very excited earlier this month when we got word about the ANBERNIC RG 476H on the way. At the time we made some inferences about the hardware we were likely to get, and it sure felt like this model could be shaping up to be a budget-friendly alternative to some of its peers. Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung. Where the base model Galaxy S has long felt overlooked and underpowered, the new “Pro” moniker led me to believe that the Galaxy S26 Pro could be the true compact flagship phone I’ve wanted from Samsung for so long.",

It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media.

Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

The update also adds compatibility for three tricky Disney Wii games thanks to clever hacks. Bluetooth passthrough, which enables Wii Remote support, has been patched to work with more modern Bluetooth adapters. Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed.

These Good Lock apps cover categories like the camera, home screen, audio, and notifications. Now, it looks like Samsung is adding another Good Lock app to its stable. Samsung users in Korea spotted a so-called Gallery Assistant beta app. This app is currently restricted to the company’s home market, and it looks like you’ll need to sign up to test it via the Samsung Members app. Check out the machine-translated screenshots below, courtesy of user TeraBlock.",

Based on community forum announcements, only the Galaxy S25 series will get the update this month. The update will be available in October and November for most other phones, including older flagships, mid-range phones, and budget phones. Update: September 16, 2025 (2:46 PM ET): Samsung Brazil has now published a One UI 8 availability schedule .

    "summary": "Apple isn't promising you the moon with its fast charging, and it's refreshing.",
    "body": "TL;DR Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max provides more transparent marketing than most other fast chargers. The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

Battery troubles have plagued several Pixel models, including Pixel 6a units catching fire, raising pressure on Google to respond. Pixels are among the best Android phones you can buy, but they have also earned a notorious reputation for battery troubles. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro now appear to be the latest devices hit by these problems, with owners reporting swelling batteries on Google’s support forums. “I am writing to report a serious issue with my Pixel 7 Pro, which I purchased approximately two years ago. Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk, including the potential for explosion or fire,” a user noted on Google’s support forums . The thread now has several complaints from other Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users who are also experiencing battery swelling issues on their devices.",

The new design with the Google Pixel-inspired camera bar is a bold choice, the new telephoto sensor sounds promising, and the A19 Pro paired with a vapor chamber should make the iPhone 17 Pro a performance powerhouse.",
