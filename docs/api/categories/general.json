According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR The Galaxy S26 might receive notable camera upgrades, even without many changes to the hardware. Samsung is rumored to bring more features to Camera Assistant, an app that unlocks hidden Camera settings on Galaxy phones. Among other features, we could see the option to click pictures at 24MP by default instead of the existing 12MP or 50MP modes. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department. While the camera itself isn’t receiving any significant upgrades, some of the software features supporting it are expected to improve. One way we can see this improvement is by adding additional camera settings options to Samsung phones through a first-party extension.",

With this change, users will still be able to access their already synced library from YouTube or Google Play, but that may not be forever.

Neither giant is backing down, and the punches won’t stop landing. In a more recent setback, Google is losing access to Movies Anywhere — a digital library management platform that allows you to sync your content from different apps into a single library.

Both Alexa+ and Gemini, which has replaced Google Assistant , are now available to users for testing and critique. In the meantime, Apple’s ambitions to catch up to its competitors with Siri continue to drag on . Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner .
