It didn't work out that way, of course, and these days it seems like the pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction: PC gaming is thriving, and the walled-garden approach of conventional consoles is increasingly being called into question. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick expressed just that feeling in a new interview with Squawk Box on CNBC . \"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,\" Zelnick said. \"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen—that's never going away.\" Zelnick's qualifying comment hints at the state of flux the game industry currently finds itself in. Microsoft insists that it's making a new next-gen Xbox console, but it also wants us to know that everything is an Xbox now, which might lead one to wonder, as PC Gamer hardware hammer James Bentley did, what the p…",

The problem is they keep getting cancelled before anyone gets to see them. \"People often ask me why I don't make a sequel to Nier, or why I'm not working, but that's because I've had so many projects that have been discontinued lately,\" Yoko said via machine translation. \"Even though I was working, it wasn't released to the public. I'm getting paid, so it's not a problem for me personally, but because my output isn't being released to the public, people see me as not working.\" While that's particularly disappointing for anyone hoping for more Yoko Taro-brand weirdness, the Nier creator is just one of many game developers who've recently had to watch their work evaporate. 2025 has continued a years-long rash of game cancellations, studio closures, …",

    "body": "Silent Hill f recently received a big update that adds a casual difficulty, speeds up NG+ runs, and reduces the number of areas where players are forced to engage with combat. The patch seems like a sensible response to some general criticisms of the acclaimed horror revival. But fans of the series are convinced that the update originated from a much more specific source—the game's lead actor. Japanese actor and model Konatsu Kato lends her voice and likeness to protagonist Shimizu Hinako in Silent Hill f. But Kato has also been livestreaming her own playthrough of the game since October, fulfilling a promise she made to fans earlier in the month. Her streams have since gone viral, with the VODs of her streams receiving millions of views on YouTube . As reported by Automaton Media, part of the reason behind the popularity of Kato's streams is her specific journey with the game. More than just being about her reactions and opinions, Kato is not a regular gamer, so Silent Hill f has proved a bit of a baptism of fire for her. Viewers have watched her contend with the game and its peculiar combat system in real-time, leading to events such as her encounter with one particular monster …",

There are a few significant tweaks here, but the things that stand out to me are: yet more fixes for the game's A-Life system and a whole new difficulty. That's in descending order of importance, so far as I'm concerned. The A-Life fixes sound a lot more interesting than GSC's prosaic \"Fixes and improvements to the A-Life system\" makes it sound. If you're not familiar, A-Life is the name GSC gives to the systems in all its Stalker games that, more or less, let the games' beasts and NPCs pursue independent lives and objectives. It's always kind of an illusion, but it's an illusion that many felt was especially lacking in Stalker 2 at launch.

Baldur's Gate 3 had to deal with characters from Baldur's Gate 2 having canonical events happen to them between games, like Minsc and Boo being turned to stone or Viconia and Saarevok backsliding into evil, and now the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 are in the same boat. The latest Forgotten Realms supplements, Adventures in Faerûn and Heroes of Faerûn, move the timeline on from 1492—when BG3 happens—to 1501, and hint at the fates of its cast. Quotes from Karlach crop up throughout Adventures in Faerûn and she appears more than once in the art for both books alongside Astarion, Shadowheart, and Minsc. And in none of those illustrations is she a mind flayer or a pile of ash—two of the potential outcomes for her in Baldur's Gate 3. The best ending for Karlach is that she returns to Avernus with the Infernal Engine still burning away inside her chest…",

The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit. In other words, it's hard to imagine going back to an unmodded build. You might know Wemino from their other excellent patches: EchoPatch for best-in-class horror FPS F.E.A.R. and VorpalFix for the original Alice game, which I used (with great results!) for a recent playthrough.

If you couldn't tell from all the things I've written about it, I love videogame music. Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves.

But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things.

As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",
