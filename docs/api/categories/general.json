If a phrase like \"open-source engine reimplementation\" fills you with dread, fear not: using OpenMW is as simple as downloading it and double clicking the launcher (though you'll need base Morrowind installed), and I strongly encourage you to do so—the devs just released OpenMW version 0.50 , and it's a doozy. \"This round number release overhauls the gamepad experience, makes foundational steps in dehardcoding combat, further expands our Lua scripting API and, among the host of user interface fix-ups, introduces the highly requested quick item transfer,\" writes OpenMW team member Capo. \"Dehardcoding combat\" is the process by which OpenMW is gradually opening up to Morrowind's core combat functionality to tweaks, expanding the Lua scripting API further enhances OpenMW's capacity for all-power…",

Cyberpunk 2077 is, now, an excellent game—worthy of inclusion on our list of the top 100 games you can play right now, no less. At launch? Less so . Now, the studio has extended a little social media backing to Rockstar over yesterday's delay to Grand Theft Auto 6 . One of the many venues in which Rockstar announced GTA 6's delay to November next year was X (the everything app!). As you can imagine, the announcement attracted tens of thousands of replies ranging from disappointment to anger to jokes to expressions of support.

And maybe that was the right call, but one side effect has been an almost comically packed release schedule on Steam through October and straight into this first week of November. Case in point: on Tuesday colony builder Generation Exile dropped on Steam to a total of three user reviews, despite a seasoned indie team behind it. Studio founder Nels Anderson was previously the lead designer of masterful stealth game Mark of the Ninja before co-founding Campo Santo to make Firewatch. Generation Exile's team also includes Karla Zimonja, designer on Gone Home and Tacoma, and Niamh Fitzgerald, lead designer of hit traffic sim Mini Motorways . Oh, and a soundtrack from FTL and Into the Breach composer Ben Prunty!? Maybe the problem is the Steam page doesn't mention that the game's got capybaras in it .

I've long been looking for a great fantasy game where instead of a brave adventurer I could just be a humble tavern keeper, and it's finally arrived—and appropriately enough, it's called Tavern Keeper . Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play.

That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody.
