A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Update: October 28, 2025 (2:15 PM ET): In response to our original article below, a Google spokesperson reached out to us with the following statement: Gemini for Home (including AI descriptions, Home Brief, and Ask Home) is in early access so users can try these new features and continue giving us feedback as we work to perfect the experience. As part of this, we are investing heavily in improving accurate identification. This includes incorporating user-provided corrections to generate more accurate AI descriptions. Since all Gemini for Home features rely on our underlying Familiar Faces identification, improving this accuracy also means improving the quality of Familiar Faces. This is an active area of investment and we expect these features to keep improving over time.",

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

After confirming the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro names, the software is now revealing their internal codenames. Samsung’s been calling the Buds 4 “Handel” and the Buds 4 Pro “Bach” after the German composers. Right now, Samsung is helping push Android in new directions with the launch of its Galaxy XR headset , but even as it experiments with new device types, the company is not backing down from its commitment to keeping things fresh for some of its fan-favorite product lines. Earlier this month we shared our latest findings that revealed the company’s work on some new earbuds, with the appearance of Galaxy Buds 4 iconography in a leaked One UI 8.5 build. And now we’ve managed to uncover some fresh details. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S.

OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T).

NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some.

Users on Reddit say their Pixels are struggling with severely delayed Google Home and other alerts. Delayed notifications has been a long-standing problem on Pixel phones. Seemingly, the only way to really fix it involves disabling a feature called Doze. Fresh reports from Pixel 10 users suggest that Google’s notification woes aren’t going anywhere. Users on Reddit say their new phones are struggling with severely delayed Google Home alerts, with some claiming that notifications only come in after unlocking the device.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that Samsung might overhaul its Galaxy S26 series lineup. What especially caught my eye was evidence that Samsung was planning to launch a Galaxy S26 Pro in place of the expected Galaxy S26. The name alone suggested that we were looking at a more feature-packed base model. That would be a long-overdue move as the base Galaxy S flagship has always been small yet bereft of upgrades. Unfortunately, spec leaks point to anything but a Pro handset. Furthermore, a recent leak also suggests that the entry-level model will revert to the standard Galaxy S26 name rather than the Pro moniker.",
