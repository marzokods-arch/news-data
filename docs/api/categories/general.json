They're worth keeping an eye on—this month, for example, they've done a whole series of really excellent value horror comics deals that I've enjoyed taking advantage of. But to keep this on the topic of games, there's one bundle in particular I'm here to bring to your attention: The Witcher Build-Your-Own-Bundle . (Image credit: Dark Horse) It includes all the Dark Horse Witcher comics as digital trade paperbacks, as well as the recently translated original Polish comics , a Gwent artbook, and The World of the Witcher, a mighty reference guide to all the lore of the videogame series. The \"build your own bundle\" part just means you can choose which items you want, with the overall discount rising the more you buy. Of course, getting all of them nets you the best possible price per book. It's only $11.99 / £10.70 to get the whole lot, which has a total value of $208.84 / £156.40. That's a huge saving, so it seems to be well worth going all-in unless you're just trying to pick up a few books to complete an existing collection.

That means starting today, Battlefield 6 is basically two games: the base multiplayer/campaign package that costs $70, and the free-to-play Redsec battle royale included within. What is Battlefield Redsec? It's a 100-player battle royale, primarily, with some Battlefield qualities that EA hopes will set it apart. \"We don't want to just be another battle royale game,\" said Ripple Effect design director Justin Wiebe in a briefing video shared with PC Gamer ahead of Redsec's launch. Destruction appears on par with Battlefield 6 maps in Redsec, vehicles serve as important power weapons, and its big ol' ring of fire will instantly kill squads who fall behind the action. Alongside battle royale is Gauntlet, a 32-player squads mode that sounds a bit more casual and familiar for core Battlefield fans. Here's the full rundown on what we know about Battlefield Redsec. Battlefield Redsec is free-to-play in the Battlefield 6 launcher Redsec is Battlefield's stab at Call of Duty: Warzone in more ways than one. Similar to the 2020 battle royale, Redsec is a free-to-play mode nestled within the …",

Given that none of BF6's maps take place near water, aside from a small section of Manhattan Bridge, it's not really feasible to have them added in at a later date for these maps, either. Hell, even the Season 1 maps don't have enough water for a leisurely cruise. So, no boats, much to the dismay of those of us who loved getting RHIBs beached and miss the days of Carrier Assault in Battlefield 4. Don't falter, though, as Battlefield Redsec, the free-to-play battle royale we all knew was shadowdropping alongside Season 1, actually gives us a glimmer of hope. Redsec's Fort Lyndon is the largest Battlefield map to date (if you can really call it a Battlefield map, that is), and to get around it fast, you need vehicles. This includes your bog-standard jeeps that we've seen in the base game, but also RHIBs that look straight out of Battlefield 4.

While Redsec is a free-to-play, separate experience from Battlefield 6, it does feature shared cross-progression in many forms, which'll avoid the pitfall of having to grind two games at once. Firstly, how about that download, the bane of way too many recent games? Being free-to-play, Redsec is available as a separate download on all platforms, but if you already own Battlefield 6, then you'll be able to boot it from the main menu. Hopefully this makes having two separate but inextricably linked games slightly less annoying and confusing for everyone, though only time will tell. Moving on to the main course, overall account progression is unified between both Battlefield 6 and Redsec, though there are challenges specific to each one. This means your account level and unlocked gear and customisation options are shared; you level up in one game, you'll see it reflected in the other.

    "body": "Microsoft has lost an awful lot of goodwill in recent times. Over the last two years, it has laid off over 10,000 workers , closed iconic studios like Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks , and raised the prices of Xbox Game Pass and its consoles multiple times. It seems that Microsoft, in light of this, has had a good fiscal year, and that is making its way up to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. As reported by CNBC , Nadella is being paid $96.5 million for 2025, which is a $17.4 million bump from last year. To put that $96.5 million figure into context, with the highest tier of Xbox Game Pass now costing $30 a month, this could pay for 3.216 million months of the game streaming service, or 268,055 years. 268,055 years ago, Homo neanderthalensis roamed the earth, and 268,055 years from now, Nvidia is likely going to be the first company to be worth $1 quintillion, probably. Nadella took a 50% pay cut willingly due to major cyberattacks against Microsoft (via Techspot ), but his huge payout is not from traditional pay. Instead, it comes from $84.245 million in stock awards and $9.55 million in an incentive scheme. Other forms of compensation make up a comparably measly $196,294, totalling…",

That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. Kicking off AMD's new-but-not-new CPUs is the very small Ryzen 10 series, comprising just two models (thanks to Olrak29_ on X for the heads-up). Despite one being a Ryzen 3 and the other a Ryzen 5, they're virtually identical, separated only by base and boost clock speeds.

But after a half-dozen hours spent with this China-developed roguelite, some of its more bonkers qualities shone through, such as the flexibility of its pet system, and the fact that depending on the build you stumble into, it can turn into something more akin to Vampire Survivors. This thing can get wildly broken, unashamedly so. The kind of broken where at some point the graphics surrender and let themselves be buried beneath overlapping damage numbers. That's what I like about it. Realm of Ink is set inside fictional books, hence the name. Most of the people and creatures you encounter don't know they're fictional entities, which could be why the voice acting is so bizarrely over-the-top, making your average Tales dub seem artful and restrained. I have to confess I quickly zoned out on the story, though the meticulously illustrated worlds kept my interest.

In his review, PC Gamer associate editor Ted Litchfield called Mouthwashing \"my favorite horror game of 2024, and one of the year's best narratives, period.\" If you're not so keen on scares, there's still plenty on offer. The entire Walking Dead Telltale series is on sale for 5 dollars , vampiric survival superlative V Rising is half-off at $17.49 , and as always, you can grab one of the slickest co-op shooters ever conceived for less than the price of a cup of coffee .

Psychopomp 1 used the grid-based, first person gameplay of old school dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock to make something that plays closer to a PlayStation 2 survival horror game⁠—you move slowly and can't maneuver very well as you navigate dungeons full of slavering flesh beasts, while instead of spells and dice roll attacks, you just have to be close enough to enemies to whack them with a claw hammer. Psychopomp begins with its clearly disturbed (maybe divinely ordained?) protagonist spelunking in the nightmare dungeons hidden under innocuous public buildings before descending even further into a subterranean world, and eventually ringing in some kind of an apocalypse with a doppelganger planet summoned above Earth. There's a lot of Lore here for wiki kids to sink their teeth into, but Psychopomp also works as a pure horror experience you can let wash over you, boasti…",

This multi-layered PCB is a fairly unique bit of hardware design, not only allowing for cleaner signal routing but also a neat little perch for a warm beverage. To be clear, I'm not recommending you crack open your extremely expensive GPU and fashion its pricey guts into a drinks coaster (though I bet that would look sick).

All of the PCB's major components are accurately represented within the printable 3D files.

(Image credit: Bulwark Studios) In the first game's Adeptus Mechanicus vs Necron battles (think weirdo religious cyborgs vs ancient alien cyborgs, if you're unfamiliar), the key was a resource called cognition. Harvested from terminals and pillars in the environment, it was used to fuel special abilities and extra movement, but was shared across your whole team, forcing careful decision-making. For the sequel, that system's been ramped right up. Now, cognition is generated by units directly in ways that define their role on the team. Lumbering melee servitors, for example, grant you a point every time they take damage, while your Skitarii rangers instead generate one every time they shoot someone from far enough away.
