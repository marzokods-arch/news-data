On the plus side, this is a very speedy monitor, even by OLED standards. It tops out at 480 Hz refresh, making it one of the quicker 1440p gaming OLEDs out there. It's also relatively reasonably priced for a model with 480 Hz refresh, typically coming in around $700 or £800. On the other hand, the LG UltraGear 27GX790A doesn't get the latest and brightest LG WOLED panel technology . It's also a bit slim on features, lacking USB-C connectivity or speakers of any kind.

To be fair, it did all seem quite portentous, and in a world where Saudi Arabia bought EA and Microsoft bought Activision, the theories that Ubi had itself been acquired or undergone some kind of enormous financial calamity didn't feel totally out there. But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way. The long and short of this process is that the new way of recognising those revenues meant the company suddenly overshot a covenant on how much net debt to core profit it's meant to maintain, and it had to quickly fork over 286 million euros to pay off some ou…",

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.

MrBeast, or Jimmy Donaldson, revealed the scope of attractions in Beast Land (and the game-oriented in-park land Beast Zone) earlier this month in a thread on X . The games on offer include Drop Zone, where players aim to be the last person standing atop a series of trap doors, and Airmail, where players drop a \"weighted bag\" from a zipline onto a target below. As reported by Kotaku , the park also features thrill rides, photo-op set pieces where you can pretend to hold Feastables with MrBeast himself, a seemingly endless spew of branded merchandise, and a stash of 1 million Saudi Riyal, or roughly $266,000 USD, which will go to the highest scoring Arena players. In other words, it's what I imagine someone who truly resents theme parks imagines they are like. Riyadh might strike you as an odd choice of location even if controversy has not stopped MrBeast from pouring m…",

    "body": "Whenever a new Overwatch hero is on the horizon, everyone tries to guess which of the three roles they'll fit into. There's been a pattern ever since Overwatch 2 came out where Blizzard releases at least one tank, one support, and one damage-dealer every year. Blizzard has never explicitly stated it was intentional, but fans have assumed it cycled through the roles to keep the number of heroes in each role balanced. Overwatch has always had significantly more damage heroes than the rest, but everyone accepted that as a consequence of it being the most popular role. The hero release pattern isn't a hard rule, Blizzard tells PC Gamer in a recent interview. And that's why its next hero, Vendetta , isn't a tank as many players expected. She'll be the game's first purely melee-based damage hero, a fantasy that the developers couldn't pass up. \"I saw a lot of very confident expectations that hero 45 was going to be a tank based off of a recent release pattern that we're now switching up a little bit,\" senior character artist Bryan Bedford says. \"But I think one of the most important aspects of adding a new hero is honestly just coming up with something that's fun to play.\" Associate gam…",

Valve's cute little cube will run SteamOS and use Proton—a compatibility layer to make Windows games play nice with Linux—but you can't play official Rust using it. The latest plea for official Proton support started on Reddit , where Scout339v2 shared their screenshot of Rust running \"on a server with EAC disabled to show that the game already works perfectly on Linux.\" Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is the key factor here, and part of a broader conversation where Facepunch and its Linux/Proton userbase don't see eye-to-eye. While it's true Rust runs on Proton, you can't join official servers, and most unofficial servers, with EAC disabled. Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support. COO Alistair McFarlane said at the time that Linux is \"safer for cheat developers,\" and that trying to support EAC on another platform could reduce the team's ability to support Windows.

Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free.
