Hoping to be in Canada from Nov. 17-22 to attend business meetings connected to his Denver-based development company Oak View Group (OVG), the filing notes that Leiweke previously surrendered his passport to pre-trial services in Denver but needs temporary access to travel abroad.

More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

The phone also loses Hasselblad branding, while the camera hardware could be a sidegrade. OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution.

This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

The smartphone has become our modern Swiss Army knife, bundling practically unlimited disparate functions into a single pocketable device. Still, arguably the most important feature in any smartphone is that it’s, well, a phone, letting us make calls from anywhere. In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through. These reports are anecdotal, but any failed call to 911 could potentially have disastrous consequences.",

The Plus model does everything the original TWO did, yes, but brings in a new capability that makes it pretty much indispensable for anyone: Apple CarPlay support.

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

    "body": "Credit: Redmi on Weibo TL;DR Xiaomi has launched the Redmi K90 Pro Max, a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 mid-ranger with a massive 7,560mAh silicon-carbon battery. The phone also packs 100W wired fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and even 22.5W reverse wireless charging. It gets a triple 50MP camera array at the back, a Bose-tuned 2.1-channel speaker system, and a serious 6.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate — all under $600. Just as flagship phones are starting to roll out with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, a new mid-range Android contender is here to steal the spotlight. Priced under $600, this fresh release isn’t exactly gunning for the Pixel A series in affordability, but wow, does it bring some heavyweight specs to the fight.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Bazzite, a Steam-like Linux-based operating system, was installed on a ROG Xbox Ally X. It appears the OS may offer better gaming performance than Windows. Bazzite also wakes faster, offers more control, and may be slightly more energy-efficient. When the ROG Xbox Ally X launched, it received a lot of mixed reviews. While many found the hardware to be fine, it’s the software that has been the main sticking point. It features a lightweight version of Windows that comes with an Xbox full-screen experience , which is meant to optimize the operating system for handheld gaming. However, this experience doesn’t quite land the plane. To see if Windows is really what’s keeping this device from reaching its true potential, some creators tried installing a Steam-like OS based on Linux called Bazzite. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Calling Cards offer a great way to customize how incoming calls appear on your own phone. So far, though, the system has lacked a way for you to choose how your Calling Card will appear remotely. A new “My calling card” screen could finally give you that opportunity. Apple’s got its Contact Posters on iOS, and earlier this year we saw Calling Cards arrive for Android, letting users customize what they see when their friends and family call. Google’s already been working to add new options there, like letting you fine-tune the fonts , but this whole time there’s been a fundamental problem with how Calling Cards work — and now it looks like Google might actually get around to resolving it.
