All projectors are available now with a two-year warranty, and accessories like stands and a karaoke mic are available to add on.

The lineup splits into two camps: convenience-focused lifestyle options and cinema-grade builds. The models range from the portable but powerful Pop projector ($679.99) to the Lifestudio Grand Ultra Short Throw ($2,499.99).

The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker. Fortunately, Google is now rolling out an update to the Photo Picker that introduces some much-needed quality-of-life improvements.

The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons.

Or choose the even brighter Dangbei DBOX02, also on sale for just $1,099. A nice digital projector is a fantastic way to add some size and spectacle to your next movie night, and while there are some utterly fantastic options available out there, there are also lots of underpowered solutions that might save you some money upfront, but are just also hampered by compromise after compromise. We love saving money as much as the next guy, though, so we’re always looking for opportunities to save big on the kind of projector hardware that won’t leave you full of regrets — and if you’re willing to act fast, we just might have one for you. Earlier this summer we were telling you about the launch of the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro , a 4K laser projector running Google TV. The interface is already a big win right there, and that bright laser light source give it 2000 ISO lumens output, meaning you’re actually going to be able to see things, even during the day.",

For example, Premium members recently started gaining access to lossless audio, a feature that many have been waiting for. Now it’s finally time for free users to get a little something. The service is now giving non-paid subscribers more control. If you’re a free user of Spotify, you’ll now be able to play any song you want to listen to. The company is calling this new feature “Pick &amp; Play.” There’s also “Search &amp; Play,” which allows free users to search for a song and start listening instantly. And if a friend or artist shares a song, you’ll be able to listen right away with “Share &amp; Play.”",

The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

The upgrade could enable you to not only unlock your Pixel phone using a Pixel Watch but also launch a specific section of the app. The feature is intended to work with a set of specific “Authorized” apps that you will be able to manage from the phone’s Settings. The Watch Unlock feature offers a convenient approach to automatically unlocking a Google Pixel phone — and keeping it unlocked — when your Pixel Watch is nearby. When enabled, it allows you to unlock the phone by simply swiping up or tapping a notification on the lock screen. Now, Google is testing new ways to unlock the screen and launching specific actions within certain apps on the phone.

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",
