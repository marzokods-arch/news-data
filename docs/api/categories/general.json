    "body": "A flurry of earnings reports for the quarter ended Sept. 30 show a continued divide in the music landscape. Live music companies such as Live Nation and MSG Entertainment posted double-digit growth as concert demand surged, while HYBE and SM Entertainment also benefitted from strong concert revenues. Streaming also spiked once again, pushing Spotify and Universal Music Group (UMG) to double-digit revenue growth. Legacy media didn&#8217;t fare as well, however: iHeartMedia revenue slipped slightly, while SiriusXM leveraged cost-cutting to compensate for flat revenue.&nbsp; Here’s a running list, in alphabetical order, of the music companies that released earnings results (as of Nov. 20) for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025.

The dock hides a detachable FlexiOne deep cleaner, essentially a portable spot-cleaning unit you can grab for carpets, stairs, and fabric messes the robot can’t reach.

We spotted this highly requested feature in the latest Android Canary build, so a Beta and Stable release will be coming in the future. One of my favorite new Pixel features in recent months is Live Effects , a tool that lets you create stunning, personalized lock screen wallpapers. However, the feature currently has one glaring problem: you can’t adjust the position or scale of your photo! While the algorithm typically does a great job at isolating the main subject, it isn’t always perfect. Fortunately, Google is finally fixing this oversight by allowing you to pan and zoom on the photo you’re applying a Live Effect to. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR The Abxylute 3D One is a new gaming handheld with an 11-inch glasses-free 3D screen. It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans. We’ve now spotted one more new feature coming to the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, which could allow users to easily locate their phone with the click of a button.

The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 .

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

In simpler terms, your employer will now be able to read your RCS chats in Google Messages despite end-to-end encryption. Encryption will still work when messages are traveling between devices, but employers will be able to use common archival apps to keep a record of RCS messages for legal and compliance purposes. Google says employees will see a notification when archival is active on their phones. Google is rolling out a new RCS message archival feature for fully managed Pixel phones. The system is designed to help companies comply with strict rules around record-keeping and legal requests for employee communication. But there is something employees should know: if you use a Pixel as your work phone, your RCS chats may be visible to your employer.",

In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone.
