The max level in Borderlands 4 is 50 , giving you a total of 49 skill points to spend across your three skill trees. Every five skill points you spend unlocks the next layer of the skill tree, apart from the final tier, which requires an extra point to get the final perk. In other words, you could almost reach the end of two skill trees if you're being efficient, though that's not really optimal for most builds.

But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips.

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

But while I send someone to perform a wellness check, you can enjoy the latest fruits of CDPR's labour: Cyberpunk 2077's 2.31 patch , out now. It's a relatively small one, which is why only the number in the second decimal place has changed, but there's still some meaningful stuff in here. For instance, autodrive has been improved so that it's less prone to getting stuck and possibly even less murderously inclined to mowing down pedestrians! Also it doesn't obey traffic lights now. No one tell Tesla about this. \"When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights,\" go the patch notes. \"Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.\" That aside, photo mode will (mostly) no longer discriminate when it comes to its various poses, as \"most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work…",

After the second-day boss my two teammates carried on into the gloop, which sends you to the Nightlord boss arena, but I decided to head over to a close Site of Grace that was located in the Night Tide. It was but steps away from the safe zone, and I didn't even make it. My health bar wasn't as big as it could've been, as I was only level 12 at the time and hadn't picked tons of HP buff effects, but the Night Tide still took a fifth of my health off in a matter of seconds.

It's also home to one of the most obnoxious runbacks in Silksong's entire library. For the record, you can find a slightly-closer bench located in the screenshot below. It's down at the bottom of a shaft with a pool of worms at its base—just break the wall to your right instead of going left. (Image credit: Team Cherry) Even here, though, the runback sucks. Groal the Great, the boss at the top of Bilewater, can only be fought after several waves of arena combat against those same obnoxious bastards you've been trying to avoid just to get to the guy.

To help you make that all-important decision, I'll give you an overview of each Vault Hunter and their three broad playstyles. However, I'd be foolish not to note that the 'meta' doesn't really matter in Borderlands, so pick whichever character you think looks the coolest. Plus, Borderlands 4 finally lets you skip the campaign on alternate characters, so it's easier than ever to try out all the Vault Hunters. Who's the best character in Borderlands 4? If I had to pick just one, the best character in Borderlands 4 is Rafa , primarily due to his incredible ability to buff his gun damage across both his Remote Agent and People Person skill trees. In fact, if you're willing to forgo having a capstone perk, you could evenly split your perks down both trees for absurd damage multipliers. It's perhaps not the most engaging …",
