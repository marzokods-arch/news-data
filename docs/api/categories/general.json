Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear …",

Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.

However, when we got our hands on the GameSir G7 Pro , we knew it was special, and it has now been crowned the best PC controller by us here at PC Gamer. The G7 Pro absolutely deserves the pro name. The front plate, thumbsticks, and face buttons can be swapped out and replaced. The red model we tested came with three included D-pads, but only the one face plate. As well as coming with programmable paddle buttons at the bottom, the G7 Pro has two near the top bumper, and, most importantly, the thumbsticks are Hall effect, which means you can say goodbye to drift. Stick drift is pretty much the biggest downside of the Xbox controller, but that's not the only way this little GameSir wonder comes out on top. It's super solid and has lovely, clicky buttons. …",

The Kickballer fires bouncing projectiles, and when you hit a shot, it'll fire a second one for free, leading to some very high damage numbers and game-breaking visuals. However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it.

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack. It's creative, it's charming, and it genuinely bridges the gap between two wildly different games.

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it.

The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick.

    "body": "There's a class of board game so complex that even successfully completing a game becomes a heroic accomplishment of logistics and human endurance. Among the most revered of those offerings is Twilight Imperium, the legendary sci-fi strategy game of galactic conquest, commerce, and political scheming that's earned its place as the 6th highest rated game on BoardGameGeek —and its 4.34 / 5 complexity rating. Soon it'll be a bit easier to enter the arena of galactic grand strategy without an Olympic swimming pool-sized dining table, because Twilight Imperium is coming to Steam. (Image credit: Red Square Games) Twilight Imperium Digital is a full mechanical adaptation of the 4X board game's 4th Edition rules, featuring all of the base game's 17 factions and their associated features. \"Twilight Imperium Digital brings the galaxy-spanning conflict and deep political intrigue of the classic board game to life like never before—streamlined for the digital space but retaining the depth, complexity, and iconic feel fans love,\" developer and publisher Red Square Games said in a press release. Speaking as someone who's only experienced Twilight Imperium vicariously through post-game reports t…",

    "body": "In July this year, Phil Spencer said Microsoft's gaming business has \"never looked stronger\" as he simultaneously announced an absolutely brutal round of layoffs . Several studios were closed outright, games were cancelled, and almost everything in Microsoft's portfolio was touched in some way, with the aftershocks still coming . One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

    "body": "It's often surprising to me how different engineering samples can be from the end product that reaches the shelves. As a case in point, redditor Substantial-Mark-959 reports they've come into possession of an early engineering sample of the RTX 2080 Ti , and it looks to be of a significantly higher spec than the release card. One Founders Edition BIOS and a modified Nvidia driver later, and Substantial-Mark-959 says they've been able to get the card up and running. The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card. Got my hands on a engineering GTX 2080ti. from r/nvidia For reference, the release version of the RTX 2080 Ti has 4352 shaders, 88 ROPs, and 272 TMUs. That'd make this particular sample slightly quicker in theory, especially as it has a 384 bit bus width compared to the standard card's 352-bit version. With the cooler removed, the chip itself looks a lot like the stock TU102 die—although as another eagle-eyed redditor has noticed, it doesn't have any markings showing the model designation. So, why did we end up with a less-powerfully-specced variant in the…",
