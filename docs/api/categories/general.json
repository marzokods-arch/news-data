    "body": "SYDNEY, Australia &#8212; AC/DC, digital streaming and that loveable blue heeler Bluey helped push APRA AMCOS’s full-year revenue and distributions into unchartered territory. The Australasian rights organization this week posted revenue of A$787.9 million ($511 million) for 2024-25, up 6.5% from the previous financial year, with net distributable revenue at A$683.4 million ($443 million), up 7.8% year-on-year, also an all-time result. For the reporting period, the group’s expense to revenue ratio was reduced to 13.26% from 14.32%. Based on recent results, the A$800 million revenue milestone should be crushed in the next annual report, and the magical A$1 billion figure is on the near horizon.

The feat usually requires some blend of the following ingredients: a strong song, a charismatic artist, aggressive promotion efforts, a devoted fan base; and, more recently, a viral live performance, meme or other stroke of luck. And that&#8217;s just to do it once . To rise (and stay) at the top of the game, demands a consistency that few artists ever achieve. But when artists lock onto that golden combination, they can accomplish a string of hits in rapid succession. To celebrate those artists, Billboard compiled a roll call of artists who cemented their pop dominance by landing five or more top 10 hits from a single album. Not only does such a feat rely on the same qualities listed above, but for an album to sustain, it needs to recreate those moments for a mass audience over the course of months. It should come as little surprise, then, that the first album to house five top 10s was Michael Jackson’s Thriller , the best-selling album of all time.

Pixel users can expect features like auto-themed app icons, an expanded dark theme, icon shape customization, and much more. Since QPR2 is going to be a big update, Google is working to ensure it doesn’t bring a ton of new bugs, so the company rolled out a new beta today to find and fix them before release. Google rolled out Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 earlier today to all supported Pixel devices, from the Pixel 6 series to the new Pixel 10 series. In terms of changes, the update doesn’t bring as many new features as QPR2 Beta 1 or QPR2 Beta 2 , but it does still fix a ton of bugs and introduces a new security patch level.",

Years and years after smartphones first started supporting it, wireless charging is having a moment. And it’s all Apple’s Qi2’s fault. At least, while we’ve been able to drop phones on charging mats for ages, the convenience and efficiency of magnet-aligned wireless charging has only really taken off with the introduction of MagSafe accessories — and now with the arrival of Qi2 25W, Android devices are finally starting to get in on the action.

Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw. Understandable as that is, his geospecific issue won’t apply to many of our readers, and the poll results below suggest that a majority of you are willing to roll the dice with Google’s smart home ecosystem at least one more time.",

MINTernet offers unlimited data and saves about $60 per year compared to T-Mobile’s service, though monthly payments aren’t available, and its network priority is unclear.

I mean, with Samsung offering 100x Space Zoom as far back as the Galaxy S20 Ultra, could you blame me? Honestly, I just wanted my favorite smartphone to provide the best possible camera experience, and I didn’t mind what it would take to achieve that. And then, Google introduced AI-powered 100x Pro Res Zoom on the Pixel 10 Pro lineup — and I still wasn’t happy. Instead, I decried the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL for leaning too heavily on AI processing. I complained that they wouldn’t treat photos of humans simply because Google wanted to avoid inaccuracies, but it had no problem using a little too much imagination while recreating signs, animals, and buildings. Overall, I dismissed the whole idea as nothing more than a gimmick meant to push AI forward.",

Quick Controls can no longer be toggled on via settings after the most recent update, suggesting it could be removed entirely. The feature still works on some display formats with a horizontal taskbar but not vertical ones. Google recently deprecated GameSnacks in Android Auto ‘s beta release track, indicating that the feature may be shut down soon. But that isn’t all that’s going away from Android Auto, as the platform’s Quick Controls feature could be next on the chopping block. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Google broke the Pixel IMS app that enabled VoLTE/VoWiFi on unsupported carriers, but the developer has already released a new workaround. Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.
