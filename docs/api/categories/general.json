    "body": "Women make up a large part of the gaming masses, 48% according to a recent analysis , and Razer is a popular brand among women. The company even tailors products to women, that are then advertised by women , and which appear to sell well among women. That's why it's surprising to see the company deploy an advert that plays on a sexist stereotype of women. Here's how the ad plays out: A woman and a man are sat on a sofa. The woman is speaking to the man. The man is holding a controller and wearing a gaming headset. The man reaches for his headset to turn on Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). The audio of the woman's voice ceases and the man continues to play his game. The next shot is the same pair walking down a corridor, once again the woman's voice is mostly muted. Then the same skit again while the pair are sat in gaming chairs. @razer ♬ original sound - Razer The on-screen caption reads: Active Noise Cancellation: on Drama: off The caption below the video reads: \"Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning.\" Clearly, the video plays to an old-fashioned trope.

Thing is, I'm a total sucker for that kind of stuff: neon lights in a nighttime cityscape, angular 80s cars modified out the wazoo cruising through the streets while breakbeat floods my ears. It's top-tier vibes, and Screamer is promising to serve up plenty of that even from just the small snippet I checked out. (Image credit: Milestone S.r.l.) Admittedly, I never played the original Screamer nor its sequel. In my defence I was approximately three entire weeks old when the first one came out. Not quite in keyboard-and-mouse territory with my tiny little fingers at that point in time.

If you've not been keeping track, Mouse is a good ol'-fashioned FPS in a good ol'-fashioned style. Literally.

That's going by tech YouTuber Cyber Dopamine's ad-hoc testing (via Tom's Hardware ). They got Bazzite up and running and spoke to one of the operating system's devs who ironed out any bugs and got the OS running well on the ROG Xbox Ally X. The end result is an ROG Xbox Ally X that seems to offer a better handheld gaming experience, though only in the games that actually work on Linux, of course. Bazzite isn't SteamOS, but it runs Steam's Big Picture Mode on top of a custom Fedora Linux distribution, and looks and runs essentially the same as SteamOS, with some extra options and so on. That in itself is a point in its favour, by my books, because SteamOS is very simple to use—it's one of the reasons I rate the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS so highly.

Or, for that matter, find a glowing review of an MMO someone has played for less than an hour? But the best Steam reviews, for my money, are the ones where a player hammers out a review that encapsulates an entire game in just a few words, like the one in the image above by Steam user \"Cyber Lesbian\" for Marvel Rivals. Short reviews are like mini-poems, really, and even when they're silly they can still tell you a lot about game. I put a quiz together a few weeks ago to challenge you to identify 10 games based only on a blurb from a Steam review . It went over well, so we're doing it again!

As you're getting your flippers under you in the Ground Zero map you'll happen upon a couple wood docks and some little text notes hinting at fishing. The early quests don't really point you towards the angling pastime though, so here's how to get started with fishing in Duckov if you're a fishing minigame must-doer. Duckov fishing spots on Ground Zero Ground Zero fishing spots marked with blue stars, one in the western pond and one in the road camp pond.

    "body": "The Secretlab Magnus Evo certainly lives up to its name, taking its signature sit-standing desk and tweaking some of its biggest friction points for a more refined, evolved experience over its predecessor. If you're already all decked out with the original Magnus Pro , there's admittedly not much different here to convince you to jump ship. But if, like me, the Evo is your first foray into Secretlab's world of desks, it's a worthy investment—if you can stomach its hefty price tag. When the Secretlab Magnus Evo first arrived, the biggest thing that stuck out to me was just how heavy the thing was. I opted for the 1.5 m desk length for my small apartment—though it also comes in the slightly larger 1.7 m length option—and with a metal frame containing motor work in the legs, my delivery tracking informed me that the box came in at a whopping 63 kg. Thankfully I had the foresight to call a friend for help with assembly, and I would definitely recommend two people to put the Magnus Evo together. The parts are heavy, and the desk has to be assembled upside down before lifted upright. The actual process of putting the desk together was simple—I'd consider myself to be a little illiterate…",

Lots of RPGs, mind , just not massively multiplayer ones. What gives? Well, I've got a few theories, and I'd like to dig into them, but before I do: I think the MMO genre is actually in a pretty good place, right now. It's aging, certainly (we'll get into that later) but you certainly aren't spoiled for good offerings. World of Warcraft's got its juice back , and it's adding player housing soon. Final Fantasy 14 looks like it's on a course-correction . Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Online are great exploratory romps. Even those outside the big leagues are merrily trucking along. Hell, you can even play City of Heroes again! Arguably in its best-ever state! What, I say again, gives? Theory 1: Well, Harvey, none of us have any goddamn free time Here's the thing.

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up. For full clarity, these are just the cosmetics I saw while flicking through the menus in the preview event, so I can't comment on how these skins are packaged, li…",

We can't predict all the lovely hidden gems that will pop up next year—we've tried, the crystal ball isn't playing, uh, ball—but what we can assure you of is that you'll see new trailers, reveal announcements, and even behind-the-scenes studio visits.

As if making the visuals bright and crisp and colorful, and adding a bunch of extra modes and minigames, and making it run perfectly on Steam Deck is gonna… is gonna… Ah, nuts. (Tall-nuts.)
