Welcome to Steam, comrade! \"What a week,\" wrote director and Battlestate COO Nikita Buyanov on X . \"This week was actual stress testing not only of our servers but also our mind and nerves for sure. But seeing you enjoy the game makes us feel better.\" Stuff like server issues and bugs can be fixed, of course, though people also have issues with Tarkov's full release that aren't going away: primarily, existing owners having to re-buy the game on Steam. That's not going to change, though presumably the disquiet will die down over time (and while it would've been nice, existing owners can of course still play through the Battlestate launcher).

When it finally burst from its coffin, the critical reaction ranged from mildly positive to firmly negative, with our own Fraser Brown giving it a respectable score of 78 in our Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 review. Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem. Speaking to Cat Burton of the Goth Boss Podcast (via PCGamesN ) TCR cofounder Dan Pinchbeck explained how he urged Paradox Interactive not to call Bloodlines 2, well, that . Pinchbeck says that, from the start, The Chinese Room inten…",

    "body": "In the ongoing struggle to play Bloodborne on PC, PlayStation 4 emulator ShadPS4 is cleaving a path in the right direction as its most recent update (version 0.12.6) significantly boosts its performance and is more accessible for those with weaker hardware. Granted, setting up the emulation in the first place is not a simple task and requires some brain-busting tinkering, but it's becoming more and more worthwhile since this time last year, when Bloodborne was first playable , though with caveats and crashes galore . There are also comprehensive guides available to steer you through the process of setting up the emulator and patching the game. A new video from tabeneru showcases a side-by-side comparison between the previous and current version of ShadPS4 on a PC equipped with Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU at 1440p with the framerate unlocked. Bloodborne's performance is far more stable now, more than doubling its average fps in some instances—far and away from sub double-figure lows. Deck Wizard also ran a test on the Steam Deck OLED in handheld and docked mode. While performance fluctuates more in handheld, it's hugging 60 fps much more frequently with lows averagi…",

In a post on The Crew Unlimited's website (via RPS ), Crew curator whammy4 details what they describe as \"one of the most important updates we've ever released.\" Whammy4 explains that, not long after TCU's launch in September, the team realised that \"if your PC date is set to post June 2029 … The Crew stops working.\" Why anyone would have their PC's date set to beyond June 2029 is beyond me, so I'm not going to call the situation urgent , exactly. But the presence of such a bug will obviously become a much bigger problem in about three-and-a-half years' time. Naturally, The Crew's saviours were \"extremely concerned\" for the long-term health of the game, and investigated further: \"At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end,\" by which whammy4 means the server created by the TCU team to get the game r…",

Today's look into the crystal ball comes from research firm Alinea Analytics (via Tom's Hardware ). In a post on X, the firm's head of market analysis, Rhys Elliott, posted some estimates for just how many scads of cash Valve has pulled out of Steam this year. Turns out? A lot. So many scads. Alinea estimates that Steam has churned out about $16.2 billion in revenue in 2025, over $4 billion of which went to Valve itself (Valve, notoriously, takes a 30% cut on Steam purchases, a number that only gets lower after your product has raked in over $10 million).

The seemingly Xbox Series X/S-inspired UI, at least on the ROG Xbox Ally X, allows you to access a bunch of different game platforms to launch games, and it runs smoother and snappier than the regular Windows environment.

So a varied career doesn't even begin to describe Kier's time on screens big and small, but to me he will always, first and foremost, be the utterly magnificent/absurd Yuri from Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge—a Transylvanian psychic who usurped control of the Soviet Union and launched an invasion of the United States, ultimately being defeated in Antarctica and imprisoned in a Psychic Isolation Chamber. Kier's unhinged performance helped define the games and is a big reason they continue to loom so large in the minds of fans.

This card was announced as a celebration of the company's 30th anniversary of selling graphics cards, and it's now officially launched at a price of, er, $4,000 . To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in. To get this special edition GPU hooked up to all the juice that its cooling and VBIOS is designed to make use of, you'll need an \"Advanced BTF motherboard\" in addition t…",

You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre. You can take a few hits and deflect certain color-coded bullets as they're about to collide with you; after doing so, you can trigger bulle…",

Over on GTAForums , user JohnCGaming has written something that can only be described as a scholarly breakdown of co-protagonist Jason’s military background, and it’s quickly become required reading for anyone interested in Rockstar’s long-awaited crime sim. Titled Jason’s Military Service, Slightly Analyzed , the post runs thousands of words and reads more like a military history essay than a standard fan theory. Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\".

Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours.

Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\".

Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 first swung onto PS5 consoles towards the end of 2023, and breached the shores of Steam at the beginning of this year. Grand Theft Auto 5, on the other hand, followed the same two-year console-to-desktop pilgrimage a full decade earlier. (Image credit: Rockstar) That first time switching between Michael or Franklin or Trevor was a wonderful feeling, as the camera moved skyward, birds-eye-view and in slow-motion, before darting in a different direction across the map and landing back at ground level; you now in control of someone else altogether. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel. Back in 2013, it was a watershed moment for the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole. Not only was it cool, it was the first time we were able to guide different playable protagonists through missions and swap paths on the fly—something that lent itself well to GTA 5's often open-end…",

And despite not being in a fully-finished state yet, even after a decade? I can tell those 11 years of labour were done out of love. I hesitate to use the word \"cosy\" to describe a game, given how that only really describes a vague aesthetic, but I struggle to find another word that fits Tavern Keeper, here. It has a goofy, polygonal artstyle, its UI is overflowing with kitschy little details, and its story books—more on those in a moment—are narrated by Steven Pacey, a seasoned audiobook narrator with a library under his belt. Playing Tavern Keeper is like stepping into a warm bath or wrapping yourself up in a heated blanket. It is, perhaps fittingly, what I imagine a Hobbit feels like while tucked into their favourite hidey-hole with a good book. It is an unrelentingly lovely experience, despite the barely-contained managerial chaos you'll be trying to channel during your playthroughs. Despite its comf…",

The newly released bike patch actually adds bicycles and electric scooters into Skylines 2, along with all the infrastructural gubbins that go along with a bicycle-friendly city. By default, your bike-loving citizens will cycle along the standard road network with cars and trucks. But you can create specific bicycle paths and bicycle road lanes to separate cars from cyclists—which is safer and healthier for everyone. Since cyclists also need a place to park their bikes when they reach their destination, the update also adds numerous types of bike parks. Just as adding more car parks encourages drivers not to park on the street, bike parks will encourage more citizens to cycle around the city rather than drive. But the bike patch adds considerably more, such as several new types of park. This includes a bike park that is also, wait for it, a bike park. What I mean by that is it's a place to park your bike that is also a bike park. Sorry, that still isn't clear enoug…",

Given Firebreak is a cooperative shooter where teamwork is crucial to survival, being able to communicate with friends verbally is kinda important. True, there are plenty of third-party options for voice-chat these days. But sorting that out can be a pain in the arse, especially when you're playing across multiple platforms. Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this. In a Steam post Remedy announced that it has added \"cross-platform voice chat\" into all versions, letting you finally gab with your pals in the Oldest House without migrating to Discord. Sadly, it isn't all good news on the Firebreak front. In the same post, Remedy also explained that Firebreak's next major update, Rogue Protocol, has been delayed into 2026. Remedy originally planned to release this alongside voice chat, but explains the mode needs \"a bit more time\" in the oven. This is because Rogue Proto…",

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations.
