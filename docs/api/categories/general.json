Claims can be filed online with a Class Member ID or by mailing a printed form, and payments are expected in early to mid-2026. We first reported on a major AT&amp;T data breach settlement back in August , which at the time was set to pay up to $177 million in total, with impacted customers able to claim upwards of $5,000. While this was originally supposed to happen back in November, it seems the dates and planned payouts have shifted a bit.

Every single phone, Android or otherwise, has an IMEI number . The IMEI number is a unique identifier that identifies a device on a mobile network, much like a personal identification number. It’s generally a good idea not to reveal or broadcast your phone’s IMEI number, just to avoid sharing it with malicious actors.

The company has been speedrunning its retro gaming handheld releases in the latter half of 2025, but today’s reveal might be something special for fans of retro gaming. The ANBERNIC RG 477V, which was thoroughly leaked last month , is a new vertical handheld that brings together the best components of the company’s 2025 releases in a new form factor. As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games. The video also shows exceptionally small bezels, which isn’t the case for other vertical handhelds like the Retroid Pocket Classic .",

The “Clear Voice” feature has been renamed to “Auto Clear Voice,” and Google now notes that the feature uses more storage. A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings. Google is now rolling out Recorder v4.2.20251104 to users, introducing a few changes to the Clear Voice feature, as well as introducing the account switcher into the app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it.

The S26 Ultra could retain its 6.9-inch QHD screen and quad-camera setup, but may upgrade to a new M14 OLED panel for improved efficiency. Samsung’s upcoming flagship lineup has been leaking for months, and if you were hoping the Galaxy S26 series would reinvent the wheel, you might want to lower your expectations. Recent side-by-side spec comparisons with the Galaxy S25 suggest Samsung is sticking to a familiar upgrade approach. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

As per a recent leak, One UI 8.5 may put apps with “excessive ad” spam into a state of “deep sleep.” It may also begin analyzing notifications on device to ensure they’re only blocked if they’re spam. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

    "body": "TL;DR Earlier this week, YouTube’s Twitter account tweeted an “it’s okay to press pause” message that was pretty much immediately misinterpreted. Rather than taking it as an invitation to unplug and unwind, Twitter users began freaking out, reading it as in support of YouTube pause-screen ads. YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

Several of these formations, including Jabal Arakanū, display striking ring-shaped structures. Jabal Arkanū (also spelled Arkenu) lies in southeastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. Several other massifs are clustered nearby, including Jabal Al Awaynat (or Uweinat), located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast. Roughly 90 kilometers to the west are the similarly named Arkenu structures . These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock. Repeated intrusion events produced a series of overlapping rings, their centers roughly aligned toward the southwest. The resulting ring complex—composed of igneous basalt and granite—is bordered to the north by a hat-sha…",
