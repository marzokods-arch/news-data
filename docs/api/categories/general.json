Earth Must Die wraps you in the silken robe of VValek Lizardtongue, a megalomaniacal alien nepo baby who has just inherited the kingdom of Tyrythia from his father. Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s. But it boasts a much more modern animation style and an absolutely stellar voice cast that includes major video game voice actors and some serious British comedy talent. Said cast includes (but is not limited to) Final Fantasy 16 lead Ben …",

There’s a whole list of contraband items that can place your base in danger, so it’s vital that you know what to confiscate. From day seven onwards, you'll need to prevent survivors from bringing weapons, drugs, and zombie body parts into the camp. On the surface, those are pretty straightforward instructions but there are a whole lot of items stuffed into survivor suitcases that aren't obviously safe or dangerous. To help, here’s a full run-through of all the contraband items in Quarantine Zone and what you should do with them. Remember not to confiscate zombie parts.

This is one of a number of content creator cameos in Quarantine Zone, a little easter egg for anyone who happens to be familiar with them. Other than the change in appearance and some new voice lines, investigating these cameo survivors works the exact same way as a standard investigation . For example, when I investigated the skeleton, I checked him for all of the usual symptoms and found that he had a crossed reflex, meaning he was infected.

Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\".

For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

By reusing characters and environments and minigames across the Like a Dragon series (and then remaking the games to do it all over again), it's able to pack each new game with a luxurious volume of stuff while simultaneously piling cutscenes to the rafters. So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite? That's the gist of Hell's Arena, a new underground fight club hiding down a Kamurochō back street in the expansion starring Yakuza 3 villain (antihero?) Yosh…",

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way. You also teleport/time travel between stages, naturally. (Image cred…",

Grace's parts will resemble Resident Evil 2 and 7, and will be \"really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay\". In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained. It's an interesting approach to blend the two primary Resi gameplay styles together, and this hybrid presentation was settled on when the team realised they couldn't have it both ways with just Leon. \"We actually tried to make a genuine horror game with Leon,\" Nakanishi say…",

The creators of that underrated gem, LABS Works, has been working on Lovish ever since, which was originally meant to release this time last year. It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it.

Compile Heart launched a teaser website today featuring an oblique, sci-fi trailer loosely reminiscent of the Megami Tensei universe, albeit with a slight horror bent. A name wasn't revealed nor a release window, but Compile Hearts has promised a proper reveal on January 29. Okada is joined by writer Tadashi Satomi, who is credited as a scenario writer for Persona 2 and Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga and its sequel, among others.
