These games can be as scary as it gets, and Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly is one of the most downright freaky there is. Publisher Koei Tecmo and its Team Ninja studio are in the final stages of a remake, imaginatively enough called Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, and has today announced a new demo for the game, as well as a collaboration with Silent Hill f. The secret sauce with Fatal Frame is that you don't have anything in the way of traditional weaponry, but you do have the Camera Obscura, a device that can…. I dunno, capture the souls of ghosts and monsters. It's a brilliant mechanic because, at the very moment you want to clench your butt cheeks and run, you've got to stay still, line up the perfect snap, and then hopefully get it right.

Not to pick too much on Highguard (review forthcoming), but every minute I'm playing it, I wish I were playing Out of Action instead. Out of Action is the debut project from solo dev Doku Games. After years of dazzling us with clips of electrifying movement and backflip headshots, Out of Action finally landed in early access last week. It's very much a work in progress—basic features like \"weapon reload animations\" and \"non-test maps\" are bound to a roadmap for now—but what it's already got is strong: 12-player lobbies (team or FFA) A real server browser (with dedicated servers) Deep loadout customization and progression A simple leaderboard Two objective modes (with more planned) Also, it's $20 and features zero microtransactions.

So much so that the majority of enthusiasts only upgrade their systems piecemeal, one component every so often, or get a new rig after many long years. But if you were hoping to build a new gaming PC or update the CPU and motherboard this year, the shocking cost of DRAM kits right now is making the process considerably challenging. Back in July 2025, you could pick up a 32 GB kit of DDR5-6000, with a CAS latency of 30 cycles, for under $90 (albeit during the sales). For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings. Rated to 4,800 MT/s and with a CAS latency of 38 cycles, this is a set that's only marginall…",

Sure, there's the LAS-16 Trident, which is cool because it fires six entire laser beams, but my new favourite weapon in any videogame ever is the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer, which is a hammer that explodes. This thing is so goddamn stupid. The idea of putting a charge on the end of a long stick that you then proceed to swing at somebody point blank is exactly the kind of ill-advised nonsense that Super Earth's canonically underregulated R&D division would look at and go: \"Sure, whatever, these guys are living for like two minutes anyway.\" You can, of course, swing it like a normal hammer, and the charge is optional. If you're a coward. There's also the GL-28, which is a belt-fed grenade launcher, and the \"EAT-411 Leveller\", which, as you might imagine, levels things. To dust. You can als…",

I installed the firmware for the keyboard through the separate firmware updater, and it was working with traditional Synapse, but no luck with Synapse Web; it just says \"no compatible devices found.\" It's not a problem with my browser, either, because Corsair's web hub works for me, and that seems to use the same WebHID protocol.

Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else.

There are Bluey Christmas decorations, Bluey slippers, Bluey rice crackers, Bluey fan art in the windows of unrelated downtown shops, and Bluey cheese sticks. Sometimes adults try to talk to me about Bluey episodes, even though they have no children to watch Bluey with. If you're sick of the blue-hued dog I wouldn't blame you. But it's incumbent on me to report, by dint of working for PC Gamer, that Bluey is going to make an official appearance in Minecraft soon. The creatively titled Bluey DLC: Bluey's House is set in Bluey's house. \"Players can meet Bluey, Bingo, Mum and Dad while reliving memorable moments from the series,\" the official Bluey spiel reads. \"They will be able to search for hidden keys throughout the home, guided by Bluey and her family, unclocking new rooms and areas as they progress.\" The spiel continues that a bunch of \"familiar activities and mini-games\" from the series will feature in the DLC, including I-Spy, Hide and Seek, and Ragdoll (I'm sure Bluey fanatics don't need me to elaborate on these, and all seem pretty self-explanatory anyway).

And then presumably you'd be hit with one of its many beam attacks. Unfortunately, the Iron Flask's potential for Poké Ball shenanigans is limited by the fact that it's single use, dashing our collective hopes of collecting our least-favorite NPCs and forcing them to fight the game's most horrible creatures—until this week.

Case in point: comedy adventure Earth Must Die from Size Five Games, which launches today. As noted on its Steam page , the game contains \"an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor,\" and that description seems to have raised at least one questioning eyebrow at Valve HQ. According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

PC Gamer's Morgan Park was there , and disgraced streamer Guy Beahm, better known to the online world as Dr Disrespect, was not—which might seem like an odd thing to say, except, well, he said he was. The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend.

He hasn't been seen since. Eva Yan, Thomas's mother, told News12 in an interview that detectives believe the boy met someone while playing Roblox online, and subsequently planned to go and meet that person in the city. She added that such behaviour was completely out of character for Thomas. Yan says family and friends are organising search parties across Long Island and the wider city nearly every day. Police add that Thomas’s last known locations were near Cherry and Rutgers streets in Lower Manhattan and later near Sands and Jay Street in Brooklyn, and ask anyone with potential information to contact them (details below).

Chainalysis puts this down as a 51% increase year-on-year for North Korea, and if accurate that would mean North Korea accounted for just under 60% of all global cryptocurrency theft, estimated at $3.4 billion in 2025.

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch. Despite pulling in nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, it's currently sitting at an incredibly low 33% 'mostly negative' reviews. If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that .
