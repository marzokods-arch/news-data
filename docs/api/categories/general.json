    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The “Now Playing” feature on Google Pixel devices is missing a key feature after a recent Android System Intelligence update. With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

The MagicX One35 is a small handheld with a 3.5-inch IPS touchscreen display in a horizontal layout, but one thing makes it stand out from any other handheld on the market. Rather than dual joysticks, it includes two D-pads: one on the left in the upper position and another beneath the face buttons on the right.",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

Over the years, it has also positioned its brand as reliable, trustworthy, and to a point, even premium, convincing people to part with their money. However, no company is perfect. Samsung phones are generally among the most expensive on the market, their flagship series falls behind some of its competitors when it comes to features like fast charging, and pushing out the latest software updates often takes more time than we’d like. Pair that with various issues over the years, including the infamous Note 7 fiasco, and it’s understandable why some consumers would rather stay away.",

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years.

Starting this week, users across Reddit’s r/kindle community began reporting a sudden “Invalid ASIN” error message. The alert claims the selected title is not valid for Digital purchase on the Kindle, even when the book was loaded via USB or email rather than bought through Amazon’s storefront. Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected. Oddly enough, if you navigate by tapping the three dots, then Go to, then select a chapter, you can crack open affected books. Toggling Airplane Mode can also help you escape a redirect loop to the Kindle Store, though it hasn’t worked for everyone.",

The redesign renames “For You” as “Home” and adds more shortcuts to the profile menu. Only a small number of devices seem to have the update so far. Google TV hasn’t been having the best luck in the crowded smart TV market recently. With relatively low adoption in the US and advertisers favoring YouTube instead, Google seems to be rethinking parts of the TV platform, starting with a potential refresh of the home screen design. As spotted by 9to5Google , the update is showing up through an apparent server-side change on top of Google TV Home version 1.0.806977084. Navigation is split into two pill-shaped clusters that sit above the content feed. One holds “Home,” “Live,” and “Apps” alongside a search shortcut, while the other contains quick-access buttons for settings and the screensaver. A built-in tooltip even explains the switch, noting that “For You” has been renamed “Home” and that search now lives in this section.",

The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation.

That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is putting together its framework for Android developer verification, connecting dev names to even sideloaded apps. Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

    "body": "Credit: AYANEO TL;DR AYANEO has revealed specs and pricing for its first budget handheld, the Pocket AIR Mini. With a modest MediaTek G90T SoC, the cheapest configuration starts at just $70. The specs are weak, but AYANEO promises full compatibility with PS1, N64, and Dreamcast, plus some GameCube and PS2. After weeks of teasers, AYANEO has finally given us a full look at its upcoming budget handheld, the Pocket AIR Mini. And unlike its previous “value” releases like the $239 KONKR Pocket FIT , this one comes in at well under $100. Sporting a MediaTek G90T SoC and 2GB or 3GB of RAM, the Pocket AIR Mini is far from the company’s premium, flagship products. And the pricing reflects that.",
