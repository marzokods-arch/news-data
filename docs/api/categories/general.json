Kind of in the way two guys with meticulously groomed moustaches will give a knowing nod when they walk past each other in the street. Upon watching arcade racer Screamer's latest narrative-focused trailer at The Game Awards, the first thing I thought to myself was, \"Huh, this absolutely feels like a fighting game.\" A tournament bringing unlikely individuals together in the pursuit of a larger, evil entity? Conversations spanning multiple languages, yet everyone seems to understand each other? Teams of three, not unlike a certain King of Fighters? Turns out my vibes were not misplaced, if chatting with game director Federico Cardini is anything to go by. Milestone's \"love of Japanese animation and fighting games\" did a lot of heavy lifting in influencing Screamer's story and overall tone. \"I am personally a Street Fighter player,\" Cardini tells me. \"Our creative director, Michele [Caletti], is a super fan of King of Fighters. And then our QA people are the Tekken guys. We also like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear —we really like them. Even the weird ones…",

A game developed as the PC's answer to Namco's Ridge Racer before its sequel delved more into rally racing. The new Screamer—set to launch next year—has a very different vibe to its '90s predecessors. Peeled away from more realistic pastures for a neon-lit anime bonanza, heavily-modded cars and the unusual decision to put narrative at the centre of its arcade racing. On paper, it looks wildly unlike the games that came before it. But as Game Director Federico Cardini tells me, Milestone hasn't forgotten its roots. I asked about some of the more negative reaction to the revival, namely from people who played the originals and weren't happy with the new direction. \"I completely understand their opinion,\" Cardini said. \"It's something we ourselves struggled with at the very beginning. But I can assure you that we have decided to do this while keeping in mind the essence of the original Screamer, which was a very fast racing game with a lot of adrenaline in it, in every race.

Forest 3's trailer begins with a first person view of a starship cockpit before something goes horribly awry and we careen impossibly far away from Earth at breakneck speeds. With the help of a cheeky little shoulder arm, our protagonist proceeds to do survival game stuff: Hunting, gathering, but no tree punching, which is a welcome relief. The sci-fi vibe really has me intrigued: The planet's swampy and foreboding, with that grey-blue, clammy, soaked-through on a rainy day look of Death Stranding. Before things fade to black, we get the disturbing sight of some kind of zombified half-torso thing emerging from the water. \"Do I have to have played Forest 1 and Forest 2 to get Forest 3?\" I quipped to the PC Gamer work chat.

Almost nothing has been left untouched over the course of its seasonal updates and system overhauls. But with the launch of its next expansion, I think its era of constant reworks will finally be over. On April 28, its second expansion, Lord of Hatred, will launch and bring with it a new campaign, a new region to explore, two new classes (including paladins ), and several features players have been asking for since the game came out. They're the kind of things that simply wouldn't work in the game it used to be. A great example of this are loot filters, which are finally coming in Lord of Hatred. I'll admit, I used to be against the idea given how important churning through loot is in Diablo games. But with the changes to items in the current season and the new ways to craft gear into exactly what you want, I'm sold on the ability to sort your items before you even pick them up.

Paladins won't be the only new class coming with Lord of Hatred, however. Blizzard says there's one more that will launch with the expansion, but it's keeping it a secret for now. \"The paladin is our knight, is our holy warrior. It's our sword and board class that is empowered by their faith,\" senior combat designer Dominick Sileo says in a video Blizzard provided to PC Gamer. A blend of Diablo 2's paladin and Diablo 3's crusader, the Diablo 4 paladin has four distinct fighting styles split up into different oaths you can choose from.

The trailer showcased large, angry, heavily bespectacled bad guy Victor Gideon, apparently a once-respected doctor who sure seems to be having a rough time of things more recently. The big twist, though, is the appearance of Leon as a playable character: Until now, Capcom has insisted that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, but it seems that Leon will be playing a significant role as well. But not the same kind of role as Grace: She will center on Resident Evil: Requiem's survival horror gameplay, while Leon will be all about the \"explosive action.\" And hoo boy does it look good: The trailer showed a brief snippet of over the shoulder shooting, as well as some of Leon's signature melee combos: That roundhouse kick fired off deeply buried synapses in my brain.

Just the upper half of a man's head is plugged into a bunch of cables but he is still, somehow, alive. And an elegantly dressed man with the iconic, gravelly voice of Stellan Skarsgård is asking you about the meaning of existence while standing in the lobby of a hotel on the moon. That's a few tantalizing hooks from Frictional Games, maker of SOMA and Amnesia: Dark Descent, who revealed its next game, Ontos , at The Game Awards today. Take a look at the announcement trailer. \"In ONTOS , players will become Aditi Amani, a resourceful engineer, as she explores the repurposed moon hotel Samsara in search of the truth around her estranged father,\" says Frictional Games. \"Samsara is a vast labyrinth built atop the ruins of a failed mining colony, and players will explore this open, interconnected environment in their quest for the truth.\" In the sci-fi mystery adventure, \"Players will scavenge for helpful items, manipulate intricate machinery and face intense tests of morality as they encounter horrific Experiments throughout Samsara.

And no, it's not going to be anything like Baldur's Gate 3. \"We're making a third-person action adventure open world game that focuses on the warlock,\" Jeff Hattem, creative director at Invoke, told PC Gamer. This is what we get for taking a one-level warlock dip in our multiclass builds—an entire game based around the class fantasy of the warlock. \"I've always thought that warlocks were really cool because they're a far cry from pointy hat wizard,\" Hattem said. \"They have that edge to them.\" To be fair, basing an entire game around a single D&D class worked for the Thief trilogy. And the idea of playing a Faust-like character who gets their magical abilities from a pact with a supernatural entity is an intriguing one. \"Warlocks, they make a dangerous pact with a powerful being, and really what it is is they have insanely high charisma. In Dungeons & Dragons, as a stat, they deal damage based on charisma. But for me, that charisma is like… they're able to convince some of…",

One of them is attached to a wheel! That's Dark Souls, to me. Set in an accursed castle, Decrepit seems to have something of a roguelike structure: You venture out from your dungeon cell, gather what loot you can, and try to fight your way to freedom before you're most likely killed and dragged back to the dungeons. But while enemies and encounters are shuffled every time you die, publisher Three Friends said in a press release, the castle's layout remains the same between runs. \"Inspired by classic first-person action games like Hexen, dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, and modern souls-likes, Decrepit emphasises spatial mastery over power creep,\" Three Friends said.

Rockstar denied allegations that it fired the employees because they were attempting to form a union at the studio, saying initially that they were let go for \"gross misconduct,\" which it later elaborated to mean they had been \" distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\" That denial didn't hold water with the fired employees and the Independent Workers' of Great Britain (IWGB) union, which filed legal action against Rockstar in November.

Case in point, the Zotac Magnus EN mini workstation with RTX 5060 Ti, which seems to power that GPU via the PCIe connector, and not in the same way as Asus BTF cards and motherboards. The mini PC was disassembled and inspected by HKEPC , then brought to my attention by Unikoshardware and Wccftech . Apart from how impressive it is to be able to fit a discrete desktop RTX 5060 Ti into such a small chassis at all, one thing that sticks out is the complete lack of a power cable for the GPU. Looking at GPU-Z shows something interesting: \"Bus interface: PCIe x8 5.0 @ x8 5.0.\" Normally, for an RTX 5060 Ti, it would just show x 5.0. While I'm not sure what the \"@\" is all about, that's basically hinting that the x16 PCIe fingers are split into two batches of x8. And upon closer inspection of the graphics card, it is in fact split in two. As Uniko and Wccf point out, the split-off part gets fed a 19 V input, as they're not being used for…",

The Ayaneo Pocket Play is a smartphone with a sliding display that can be pushed up to reveal a d-pad, AXBY face buttons, and two virtual joystick touchpads. Ayaneo had previously teased this gaming-geared phone early last month . Now, there's a fresh blog post in Ayaneo's typically effusive style about the Pocket Play, plus a Kickstarter page . However, tech specs remain thin on the ground. We don't yet know what processor this bad boy will end up boasting, or even the device's display dimensions. However, given that Ayaneo is known for Android-based gaming handhelds such as the Snapdragon-based Ayaneo Pocket S , perhaps I won't need all three guesses to figure out this phone's headlining hardware specs. So, like most of its ilk, it will likely be an Android device. That means we won't be able to play our precious PC games on it without an emulator, such as Winlator, which is a bit of a job to set up. At least other forms of Android emulation are generally excellent these days. Though there's no gesture at a release window beyond the words 'coming soon,' I'm already intrigued.

Now a new sentence has emerged: Magic: The Gathering's new Marvel set has a combo where you make the Incredible Hulk so, so very angry by forcing the poor guy to step on spiky caltrops over and over and over again, hurting his poor feetsies. As spotted by Wargamer , you do need to put in a little work here—the card starts off as an un-crashed out Bruce Banner that has to be transformed with six mana. Once he's all green'd up, though, there's a crucial bit of rules text: \"Enrage—Whenever The Incredible Hulk is dealt damage, put a +1/+1 counter on him. If he's attacking, untap him and there is an additional combat phase after this phase.\" Combine this with Caltrops, which deals one damage when a creature attacks, and you start to see the vision: The Hulk crashes into an enemy, roaring, frothing at the mouth.

We pleaded to Activision to take a break, made our case that the 12-month cycle was unsustainable and diminishing, and Activision responded by doing the exact opposite for going on 20 years. With the sort of \"milk it dry\" hubris that defined the Bobby Kotick era of Activision, the megapublisher decided it could outpace CoD burnout— outrun diminishing returns—by tripling down. More studios, more bodies, more CoD. CoD but battle royale. CoD zombies. CoD extraction. CoD on your phone. CoD but battle royale, but on your phone.
