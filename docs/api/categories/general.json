Judging by the screams in the house, XG might’ve stolen the show with their performance of “Gala.” The track has been described as a “high-energy, runway-ready anthem,” driven by &#8220;futuristic sounds.” Their performance of it during the final stages of NBC&#8217;s The Voice was a gold-clad bolt of energy, a leaping-off point for their own brand of “X-pop.” &#8220;Gala&#8221; is the pre-release single from JURIN, CHISA, HINATA, HARVEY, JURIA, MAYA and COCONA’s long-awaited debut studio album, which is slated to drop Jan. 23, 2026 . The Japanese girl group first teased the album release date in early September, and, later in the month, music fans voted “Gala” to the top of a music poll published on Billboard . “This song was mainly inspired by the iconic Met Gala,” XG’s MAYA told&nbsp; The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year, adding, “We tried so many new things, choreography wise, music wise and fashion wise, so we’re really excited to showcase that. I feel like this song is really XG.” Also, HARVEY explained to&nbsp; THR , “I think it’s fair to say that we’ve grown a lot since we first debuted, but personally I t…",

If you’ve ever pulled a Pixel phone out of your pocket to find the flashlight on or a half-finished call underway, you’re not alone. Accidental touches have been a long-standing frustration for Pixel owners, but it now appears that Google is preparing to address the issue in a future update. As first reported by PiunikaWeb , a Google engineer recently marked a related issue as “fixed” on Google’s public issue tracker. In a short comment dated November 29, the engineer said the problem has been resolved and advised users to “watch out for future releases,” which strongly suggests the fix is on its way.",

Google’s Gemini app just got a big update for anything related to location, and it’s making it easier to find places that matter to you. Now, instead of a plain text list with a small map at the bottom, your local search results start with visuals and context inside Gemini . If you’ve ever asked Gemini, “Where’s a good coffee spot nearby?” and had to scroll through lots of text before opening Google Maps , this update aims to fix that. Now, the first thing you see is a map, followed by cards for each place with photos, star ratings, and highlights from reviews, the Gemini team confirmed on X . Android Authority first spotted this feature earlier this month, along with a ChatGPT-inspired redesign to Gemini’s tool menu .",

This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

Google has already given us lots of great tools for working with imagery, and a couple months back we spotted evidence of development on another big one: Letting you mark up images you share with the Gemini app . Then a few weeks ago a leak revealed that Google was prepping the same sort of markup trick for Gemini on the web . And now, both appear to actively be in testing.

With 2025 starting to wind down, a lot of us have been looking back on everything that’s happened this year. It’s definitely been a busy one, filled with not just plenty of major launches, but also a bunch of noteworthy anniversaries — like YouTube turning 20 years old .
