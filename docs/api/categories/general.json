    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

    "body": "TL;DR Over the past day or so, several reports of Pixel phones struggling to connect to 911 emergency services have appeared on Reddit. Affected models reportedly include the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 8. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. The smartphone has become our modern Swiss Army knife, bundling practically unlimited disparate functions into a single pocketable device. Still, arguably the most important feature in any smartphone is that it’s, well, a phone, letting us make calls from anywhere. In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through. These reports are anecdotal, but any failed call to 911 could potentially have disastrous consequences.",

The Plus model does everything the original TWO did, yes, but brings in a new capability that makes it pretty much indispensable for anyone: Apple CarPlay support. Finally, multi-OS families won’t need two different dongles or need to fight over whether Android or iOS gets preferential treatment in the car. Now, everyone can live in harmony.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole. However, it seems T-Mobile has caught on, and the free ride is now coming to an end for them. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

When the ROG Xbox Ally X launched, it received a lot of mixed reviews. While many found the hardware to be fine, it’s the software that has been the main sticking point. It features a lightweight version of Windows that comes with an Xbox full-screen experience , which is meant to optimize the operating system for handheld gaming. However, this experience doesn’t quite land the plane. To see if Windows is really what’s keeping this device from reaching its true potential, some creators tried installing a Steam-like OS based on Linux called Bazzite.

The app fails to launch because it can’t find a font that’s only provided through Google Play Services. Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

Instead, the company is developing a centralized computing platform that will serve as the backbone of its next-generation in-car software. At the heart of this system will be Google’s Gemini.",

The feature, currently referred to as “Me Meme,” allows users to insert their face into meme templates. It requires a backed-up reference photo, preferably a clear selfie, to work. Google Photos is inarguably one of the best apps that you could have on your Android flagship. What makes Google Photos better is that Google has been constantly and tirelessly working on adding new features to the app, making it useful in the present times. We’ve spotted Nano Banana integration in the works, as well as improvements to the photo-to-video generator . We’ve now spotted Google Photos working on a meme generator, but with a twist: it will use AI to make you the meme.

The new phone will have a 1.5K resolution screen running at 165Hz, compared to the OnePlus 13’s QHD+ 120Hz display. The company says this is because it’s not possible to have a QHD+ screen running at 165Hz. The OnePlus 15 is scheduled to launch in China on Monday, and we know the phone has a 165Hz refresh rate. We previously heard rumors that the device would have a lower-resolution screen, though, and OnePlus has now confirmed this. OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499.

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube has introduced a new timer that automatically pauses scrolling through Shorts. Scrolling can be resumed at any time, and Shorts will still appear throughout the app while the main feed is paused. This timer is rolling out beginning today, but you may not have it just yet. Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

It is testing the option to use Nano Banana right from the Gemini overlay, which appears when you activate Gemini over another app. It is also testing a “Feeling Lucky” button for Nano Banana, though we’re unsure of what it does. Google has been committed to making its viral Nano Banana image generator available more widely than any of its other AI tools. We’ve witnessed it being added to apps other than the Gemini shortcut, with Google even testing it inside the NotebookLM and Messages apps.

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH_7CeVVxDY Last week, I got to spend some time with Samsung’s newest device, a mixed reality headset called the Galaxy XR. This is the “Project Moohan” product Samsung has been working on for ages to take on the Apple Vision Pro. It’s an important launch for the company, and it’s even priced to compete — well, sort of. At $1,799 , it’s about half the price of Apple’s headset, which is certainly good news, but still a massive amount of money. I’ve already talked extensively about what the Galaxy XR is and what it’s like to use it. In this article, though, I want to talk about something I realized almost immediately after my demo with the headset: this isn’t really a Samsung device.",
