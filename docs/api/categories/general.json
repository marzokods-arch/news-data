Is there evidence for this? Nope— quite the opposite, actually —but it endures because it jibes with the worldview of certain Fallout fans who see Bethesda as perverting the series. Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well. To coincide with the setting, most of Stranger Things' iconic characters are available to play as too, and each comes with unique abilities to help you make your way through Hawkins.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game. That's seven days from now, if you've still not wrapped your head around what year it is. Which, hey, same. BioWare had its fair share of con…",

Scattered throughout New Vegas' Honest Hearts expansion, Clark's journals are an autobiographical account of the bombs falling and his experiences (and eventual death) in the world that followed. It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows.

Even climactic moments like the faceoff against big bad Mehrunes Dagon in Oblivion , which released two years before Fallout 3, seem static compared to Prime; Dagon is big and all, but Prime trundles across the open world like any other NPC. You might think it's as simple as dropping a 3D model into the world and letting him run around, but the specifics of Prime's march took endless hours to get right. As Bethesda's studio and production director Angela Browder recalled in an interview with PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield, \"Liberty Prime is just one of those ones where we spent months trying to get him to walk this very specific path. Months.\" \"We just want you to walk down this very specific path and do this very specific thing. It's all we're asking you to do, sir,\" Browder said. \"Sometimes when you're developing, you're like, 'Could you just stop?'

Here are the rules I'm narrowing things down with: Released (or otherwise re-released) in 2025: A fresh crop of recent underdogs Little to no coverage on PC Gamer before: Played & recommended by me Undersold, not underrated: Only gems hovering around 95% positive user score Offbeat, within reason: Fewer sicko picks this season, plenty of refreshing flavors 30% discount minimum: Wouldn't be a proper sales roundup without savings One game per genre, with as wide a range as possible: Something for everyone Since the year was so densely packed, I'm annoying the editors by slipping in a thematically related (but less beholden to the rules) alternative to each pick, for 30 games total. …",

The update is detailed in a Steam community blog post , which reasons \"This will most probably be the final large update for BIY.\" It seems to be primarily targeted at modders, but contains five new words for use in custom levels: become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. If you've never played Baba is You, words change the way a given level works as you construct condition-altering sentences. For instance, Baba is Happy would theoretically make the player character happy… what effect that would have on a puzzle, I'm not sure. There's also a bunch of new sprites, including a fox, a bean, a hot dog, a cactus, and so on.

The Hightown Update comes after a short delay, but dropped just in time for a New Year's Day celebration. The release trailer shows off some of the new areas and a new weapon: a revolver with a rifle stock and a scope slapped on. A teaser blog post on Steam said the new patch contains both \"largest, most vertical open area\" and \"the most sophisticated, lethal and complex enemy force\" yet seen in Gloomwood, and shows off more of the new areas, which look suitably gothic and dismal.

A highlight of the series is the arresting performance from lead actor Rhea Seehorn, who plays one of the only normal humans left after most of the world suddenly merges into an eerily polite gestalt consciousness. Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",
