But he doesn't really recommend it. Depth Five was introduced as part of Nightreign's recent Deep of Night update , and requires slowly leveling up through the earlier depths first. The lower depths introduce more challenging enemies and random Nightlords, but balance this difficulty with powerful new weapon and relic effects that seriously open up the game's buildcrafting. \"I grinded up to depth five this past week,\" Ongbal wrote in the video description. \"And well… honestly it's not enjoyable at higher depths.\" Ongbal accomplished this solo run as John Darksouls himself, Wylder. Despite the YouTuber's predilection for katanas and Sekiro, Ongbal only favored the Sekiro-parrying samurai character, Executor, early on, with his videos quickly transitioning to focus on Wylder gameplay. It makes sense: Wylder's mobility and surprisingly high skill ceiling has made him a favorite among the hardcore Souls kiddies. Perhaps the mos…",

That's right: his majesty Carl Philip, duke of Värmland and prince of Sweden. We all know that the good prince knows his GTA 5s from his Herzog Zweis, which makes it all the more galling that the Excellent Swedish Design award has never been given to a videogame before now. I suppose I can blame that on Svensk Form, or the Swedish Design Association, the non-profit which doles out the award annually. Split Fiction was one of a dozen recipients alongside not-videogames like the TP-7 field recorder by Teenage Engineering and a furniture collection called The King's Hat. It isn't possible to apply for the award, but Svensk Form's inclusion of game designer Bobbi A. Sand in the curation jury may have had something to do with the co-op platformer's nomination.

It's by far the best ranged weapon in the game, dishing out instant death for lesser infected and human enemies by slicing right through them, and taking huge bites out of the health bars of even the biggest and deadliest boss monsters. Plus, this is the zombie apocalypse. Of course you should be able to craft a weapon that fires spinning sawblades. (Image credit: Techland) Thing is, the blueprint for the Sawblade Launcher isn't easy to find in Dying Light: The Beast unless you know exactly where to look. It's hidden way, way off in a section of the map you might not explore until late in the game. I was level 9 before I found it (and I finished the game at level 13), so I spent most of the game without it. But the Sawblade Launcher blueprint is in a level 6 area of the map, so you should be able to get your hands on it much earlier than I did.

Borderlands 4 is currently sitting at a \"Mixed\" rating on Steam, and a quick glance shows that nearly every negative review is about performance issues (with some adding \"don't blame the consumer\" for Pitchford's benefit). PCG's Nick Evanson notes that \"every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release\" and this time is no exception. \"We're reading every piece of feedback you share,\" says the Gearbox statement , which makes you feel a little bad for the poor staffer charged with that duty. \"We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming [today].

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy…yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet. At the time I almost even agreed, but two years later it feels like we've finally arrived breathless at a tough summit to look down into a valley of plenty in the big-budget, story-forward party RPG scene.

Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like.

When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play.

Only problem is, if my experience is anything to go by, it might not work all too well. There are detailed instructions on how to set it up on your Windows handheld on Reddit, thanks to user Gogsi123 (via The Verge ). The basic idea, though, is to become a Windows Insider, update to 25H2, and then if you can't see the option in your Settings, you can use ViVeTool to enable the feature (some of you might remember using this tool to enable Copilot features before they officially rolled out in some regions). (Image credit: Future) When I saw the ROG Xbox Ally at Gamescom last month, Asus seemed to pin Microsoft's Xbox Full screen experience as one of the handheld's selling points. Neither Asus nor Microsoft have pretended that the handheld gaming mode would only be for the ROG Xbox Ally, but it was expected we'd only be able to see it when the handheld launches on October 16, with other handhelds sometime after that.

Already, we've found the reprised iconic Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, the pleasantly-named Rainbow Vomit that covers all your elemental needs, and the Slippy , a fish grenade. Of all the 150-odd legendaries discovered so far, though, one has taken the cake as the most ridiculous: the Kickballer . When paired with a Jakobs licensed part and enhancement, you can get this shotgun to infinitely bounce projectiles around the room, nuking everything on the screen. More often than not, that also includes you, which can get pretty awkward as there's usually nothing left standing for you to kill to revive yourself. But what if I told you that there was another way? Some other shotgun that does brain-breaking damage that won't kill you in the process, and is somehow a random-ass purple item?

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.

    "body": "Before booting up Zexion on my Steam Deck last weekend, I made a grievous error: I looked it up on YouTube and saw that someone had finished the game in three hours. Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

    "body": "Blizzard struck gold last year by taking an old World of Warcraft expansion and turning it into a Diablo-style action RPG where you become an unkillable god—a level of power not normally possible in the MMO—and earn a bunch of goodies to bring back to the regular game at the end. Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long list of changes that essentially removed all of the gear …",

    "body": "The Into the Unjust update that hit Helldivers 2 earlier this month sent the tireless forces of Super Earth deep into Terminid territories. There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality …",

Videogames have a long history of Jacks as well—it's just a good, solid, go-to name in a game.

A new map and quests for a two year-old game, and no charge? Such largesse is only possible thanks to the involvement of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has made many gaming investments as part of its mission to detoxify the image of the brutal petrol state. The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site. As to the question of whether the DLC is being fully funded by the PIF, Ubisoft says it does \"not comment on rumours.\" It appears that Ubisoft staff are not particularly happy about the publisher getting into bed with the Saudis.
