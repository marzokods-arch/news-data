While we&#8217;ve all got things to work and improve on for the year to come, we also have some wishes for things our marquee pop stars could commit to accomplishing in 2026, both for our sakes and for theirs. On this first 2026 episode of the&nbsp; Greatest Pop Stars podcast , host Andrew Unterberger is joined by&nbsp; Billboard &nbsp;charts senior analyst/writer (and regular Greatest Pop Stars guest) Eric Frankenberg to offer some New Year&#8217;s resolutions on behalf of said pop stars. We each choose five resolutions for specific pop stars to take on for 2026, and then we also offer one each on behalf of all pop stars collectively, and then one for us ourselves as pop fans. Among the most pressing questions addressed: Is it more important for Beyoncé to return in 2026 with visuals for her last two albums or with the last act in her LP trilogy?

The Sydney-raised singer and songwriter performed INXS ’ classic song “Never Tear Us Apart” for the New Year’s Eve 2025 concert, a somber moment as guests lit candles and reflected on the 15 people killed during a Hanukkah celebration . At 11pm local time, the official festivities were paused to observer a minute’s silence, as the Harbour Bridge was lit up with white light to symbolize peace, and a menorah was projected onto its pylons to show solidarity with the Jewish community. “Never Tear Us Apart” has a special place in the hearts of Australians. Released in 1988 as the fourth single from the album Kick , “Never Tear Us Apart” lent its name to a 2014 Australian biopic on the band, and the life and untimely passing of its singer Michael Hutchence. That two-part miniseries reignited interest in the new wave group, which is no longer active. Earlier in 2025, the song came in at No.1 on triple j’s inaugural Hottest 100 of Australian Songs poll.
