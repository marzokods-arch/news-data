Explore All of Billboard’s 2025 Year-End Charts I’m the Problem , which ranks at No. 2 on the year-end Billboard 200 Albums recap, debuted at No. 1 on the weekly Billboard 200 dated May 31 and spent 12 weeks leading the list during the annual eligibility period (see methodology below). Wallen’s Top Artists trophy was also earned in part by his success on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 songs chart during the chart year, placing more titles on the list (41) than any other act. Of those, nine reached the top 10, including “What I Want” (featuring Tate McRae), which spent a week at No. 1 upon its debut in May. Wallen is the first act who primarily records country music to crown the Top Artists list since 2009, when Taylor Swift took home her first win in the annual recap.

These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete.

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G.

At its thinnest point, the TriFold measures just 3.9mm (0.15 inches), and trying to achieve this has presumably also forced Samsung to cut out excessive features. The additional fold on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has allowed Samsung to increase the battery size on the TriFold while retaining the same camera system. However, Samsung, at some point, could have been evaluating another camera system — with four rear cameras instead of the three actually present on the foldable.",

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns.

Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront.
