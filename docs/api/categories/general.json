I’ve played it for around 15 hours in the last four days, and all the while I’ve watched online communities grapple with it, most of whom seem to have progressed further than me. I’ve spent at least half as many hours reading about Silksong these past few days as I have playing it. And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",

In one of the game's standout scenes, BJ Blazkowicz finds himself infiltrating a Nazi base on Venus by auditioning for the role of himself in a propaganda movie. It's revealed during the audition that the Fuhrer is executive producing, and a tense, Tarantinoesque standoff ensues. The clearly addled, declining Adolf lurches around the room, muttering about conspiracies and personally executing the actors that fail to impress him. He even urinates right on the floor⁠—more on that in a second. \"We're starting from, 'What would be the coolest locations to play in?'\" said MachineGames co-founder Jens Matthies. \"We want to do Area 52 and we want to do Venus. Okay, but how the fuck are we going from there to there?\" From there, he came up with the idea of the casting call and its surprise producer.

The Widow is fast but her attacks are well-telegraphed, so with a little study and patience you can learn her patterns and get through the first phase by making use of your drifter's cloak and new cling grip ability. The second phase gets a bit more chaotic, but I've got some tips for how to beat the Widow in phase two before she smooshes you to death with a rain of bells. What do you need to fight Widow? Here's what I used to beat the Widow, but there's no must-have bit of gear for this fight . I guess that's both good and bad—there's no way to trivialize this fight with a specific weapon, but it also means you don't need to be out there grinding for rosaries before the battle.

While you can farm a fair few Rosaries in Mosshome by running back and forth between the bench on the left side of The Marrow, and in Deep Docks, this farm is located in Act 2 in the Choral Chambers , and will net you basically everything you need in a pretty safe way. If you're not in Act 2 yet then look away now, or come back later when you are. When entering the Choral Chambers (after you've purchased the map), instead of heading straight up, you'll want to head over to the right and climb that side instead, making your way up to the First Shrine structure in the far top right. When you get here, ring the bell by freeing it with Silk Spear and then rest on the bench. I then recommend you head left, jump up the platforms all the way to the very top and open the Ventrica system here. It's also advisable to open the Ventrica at the Gra…",

Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper.

Subnautica 2 is now the most wishlisted game on Steam , followed by Valve's MOBA-shooter Deadlock. Slots three through five are taken up by Battlefield 6, Borderlands 4, and Light No Fire. Steam's publicly available data isn't the end-all, be-all of the hobby⁠—not the least because it doesn't account for other storefronts or console players⁠—but it is useful for divining trends and getting a snapshot of the current gaming scene. It's kind of weird that the two most desired PC games of the moment are such basket cases, right? They boast pre-release anti-hype cycles to give the long Silksong silence a run for its money, yet we apparently can't get enough of them. Let's start with Deadlock: Given the fact that it's an honest-to-god new Valve game, it's shocking it hasn't just clinched number one by default. But it's a kookster: The second most wishlisted game on Steam is already being played for free by tens of thousands of people⁠—about 45k at the time of writing, accor…",

The number two slot on the Nexus top 30 feels like an old friend: Always Have Compass Effect by Synthlight. Silksong, like the first Hollow Knight, requires you to give up space among your buildcrafting \"tools\"—the equivalent of charms from the first game⁠—to have an icon showing your place on the map screen. You effectively have to make yourself weaker to receive that comforting navigation aid. Synthlight's mod just gives you the effect for free, and the author has a similar project for the magnet tool that makes picking up currency easier. Both projects require the BepInEx Unity plugin to function.

Naturally, you don't know who's who. So, that \"engineer\" could actually be the imposter trying to get you to cut the wrong wire. Spotting the imposter and correctly defusing each player's bomb involves playing mini games, where you have to either outsmart your friends or bluff your way to victory.

The inner life that elevates NPCs to characters who haunt their levels long after they're ragdolled. The name above the door of that business? AudioLog. It's only fitting, since the inventor of the audiolog was a writer on both Dishonored and its 2016 sequel. During the development of System Shock, Austin Grossman had helped figure out the fundamentals of the genre we now call the immersive sim.

This was extremely rare in PC gaming in general at the tail end of the nineties, and it makes System Shock 2 unique among the classic immersive sims. With its 25 th anniversary remaster, Nightdive Studios wanted to ensure this co-op functionality was brought up to date with the rest of System Shock 2. Yet according to producer Daniel Grayshon, getting it to work was a nightmare worthy of SHODAN herself. Speaking on the Nightdive Studios Deep Dive podcast, Grayshon explains the sticking point was how System Shock 2 uses an old-fashioned direct IP connection based on DirectPlay. \"[This] was a very old Windows built-in functionality to do some redirecting somewhere and ultimately try to end up at the destination,\" he says. Aside from DirectPlay being insecure by modern standards, Nightdive also wanted the remaster to support crossplay between PS5, Xbox, Switch and so forth. \"We need to strip this out, completely strip this out. We can't have direct connections anymore because the consoles will not allow that at all,\" Grayshon explains. \"We need to construct some kind of lobby system, and we need to tap…",

But these bigger features came at the cost of a more simplistic driving model, leaving players who preferred the stern navigational challenge of SnowRunner put out. Now, though, Saber has released an update to RoadCraft that folds some of that driving complexity back in. Or at least, it gives players the option to reinstate it themselves if they so choose. The update adds a \"hard mode\" to RoadCraft in the form of several difficulty modifiers, each of which can be toggled on or off depending on how granular you want the experience to be. For driving fans, the key additions are limited fuel and \"realistic\" gearboxes—the latter of which basically means that RoadCraft now supports manual gear-shifting. Frankly, it's wild that RoadCraft launched without this functionality. Fuel management and manual driving are standard features in most dedicated driving sims, let alone a game born from the legacy of SnowRunner…",

But there is one adjustment that has potentially game-altering ramifications, and it all has to do with the noise that guns make. Basically, Facepunch has altered how sound propagation for firearms works, so gunshots can be heard at significantly longer distances than before. Implementing this was more complicated than you might expect, as Facepunch explains in a Steam post : \"Networking range in Rust is made up of grids,\" the developer explains. \"These grids are a fixed size and can be adjusted by server owners, they are sometimes reduced on high-populated community servers to lower network overhead. When these grids are reduced, it also reduces things like: gun audio.
