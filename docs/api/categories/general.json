    "body": "As reported by Automaton , iconic video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, has recently given his take on the state of videogame music. In an interview with Japanese outlet Real Sound , Uematsu commented on where the industry is now, particularly concern about creative freedom for composers being stifled. \"I won’t go as far as to call it stagnation, but I believe directors and producers hold too much power in their hands even when it comes to the music,\" said Uematsu, according to Automaton's translation. \"Even now, game composers aren’t in a position to speak their opinion freely, and no matter how much musical knowledge or technical skills they possess, they’re still in a position where it’s difficult to speak their mind. \"There are almost no game producers who are well versed in worldwide entertainment and are familiar with a wide variety of musical genres, so anything goes for them as long as you make it sound like a John Williams movie soundtrack.\" Uematsu compared the situation to the game music industry back in the NES era of the 80s. Back then, few composers had their eye on making music for games, but that has changed dramati…",

    "body": "The screen adaptation of BioShock is still in the works at Netflix, but it sounds like we're going to have a long wait before its release date. The delay is due to director Francis Lawrence's busy schedule, according to an interview with The Direct . Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one. Unfortunately for BioShock fans, that means Lawrence has his hands full for the time being. Filming for a movie like Sunrise on the Reaping can take …",

To that end, they used a corridor on the way to Nox in the Deepnest area of Hallownest, and part of the path to Pinmaster in the Blasted Steps of Pharloom.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",

Part of that is my bad for skipping the original Hollow Knight—I thought I'd have plenty of time to try it before Silksong ever actually came out. But now it's here and I've spent over 25 hours with the videogame equivalent of sticking your hand into the Dune pain box. Need to Know What is it? A 2D action game with challenging combat and platforming Release date: September 4, 2025 Expect to pay: $19.99 Developer: Team Cherry Publisher: Team Cherry Reviewed on: RTX 5090, Intel Core i9 12900K, 32GB RAM Multiplayer: Yes Steam Deck: Verified Link: Steam Silksong may be one of the most painful 2D action games I've played, and the worst part? I inflicted that pain on myself by pressing forward until I'd seen just about every inch of the bug-inhabited land of Pharloom. And that's saying something; despite being a 2D game, Team Cherry has stuffed enough levels, characters, and quests into Silksong to fill a 3D world. It never ends: Lift up a rock and you'll find a boss eager to be your newest archnemesis or an obstacle course of spikes and blades that are about as rewarding as scratching a mosquito bit…",

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito.

The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

It's not exactly been smooth sailing for 2K Games and Gearbox Software, the publishers and developers, as the game's overall performance is rougher than the Drake Passage. To help matters (or make things worse, depending on your point of view), 2K produced a detailed chart of what settings Nvidia GPU owners should use to get the best performance. However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware. Especially the CPU, it would seem, because the minimum system requirements demand an '8 core (or equivalent)' processor, citing an Intel Core i7 9700 as an example. Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below). But what if your gaming PC has a processor with fewer cores, a Core i5 or a Ryzen 5 chip, for example? Does that mean you're going to be in trouble? To find out, I've spent the day running a series of tests on two gaming PCs, where I've decreased the num…",

Oh, and under code name, it's listed as \"products formerly known as Comet Lake.\" How very Prince . Yes, you too could be the proud owner of a five-year-old six-core, 12-thread CPU with a max boost clock of 4.3 GHz and 12 whole MB of L3 cache—albeit with a fancy new name (via Tom's Hardware ). To be honest, it's probably still a reasonably decent CPU in many scenarios, but you can't deny that this sort of rebranding makes things even more complicated for your average user trying to decide on their next upgrade. That's not to mention that the Core i5 110 is an LGA 1200 socket chip, which is a whole two generations behind.

Decrepit grognards (me), meanwhile, get misty-eyed thinking about how awesome Fallout 1's pulpy, morally dubious take on the post-apocalypse was. And we will literally never shut the hell up about New Vegas . So colour me surprised that when The Vile Eye asked OG Fallout co-creator Tim Cain about things he'd love to see in one of the games (via GamesRadar ), Cain's answer was unequivocal: \"The one thing I always wished was in a Fallout game was an actual good faction. Like 100% good.\" Cain has a pretty clear idea of what \"100% good\" means, saying that they'd spend their time \"growing food and making shelters and looking for old tech and maybe looking for old medicine, and they're really trying to help people.\" As to why he wants to see this, it's not (just) because he's an old softy, but because he thinks it'd be interesting to see how players approached them.

    "body": "Borderlands 4 got off to a rough start on Steam today, mostly because of performance and crash problems—you can read more about that in Nick Evanson's heroic launch-day performance report . As I write this, there's been no official response from Gearbox about the game's technical issues, but it has put out a statement on another complaint that's cropped up, much more rarely but still visible here and there in negative user reviews: Borderlands 4's terms of service. You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

    "body": "When it comes to the Borderland series, some things never change: The cel-shaded look Gearbox settled on all those years ago, the love-it-or-hate-it humour. And on PC, there's one more thing you can throw into the mix: every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release. Which is to say, not very well. Post-launch patches solve most of the issues in time, but stutters, hitches, and relatively low frame rates are the norm for the series, so my expectations for Borderlands 4's launch performance weren't very high. And sure enough, it needs work. I've tested Borderlands 4 on two gaming PCs: one that just meets the minimum system requirements ( Core i7 9700K , Radeon RX 5700 XT , 16 GB DDR4-3200) and one that's a top–end gaming rig ( Ryzen 7 9800X3D , GeForce RTX 5090 , 32 GB DDR5-6000). Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .
