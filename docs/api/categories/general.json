    "body": "Jon Bon Jovi is reflecting on decades of friendship and influence as he celebrates Forever (Legendary Edition) , a newly expanded version of Bon Jovi’s 2024 album that features fresh collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and Jelly Roll . Speaking on SiriusXM’s Bon Jovi Radio , the frontman opened up about how his longtime New Jersey peer Bruce Springsteen ended up contributing harmonica to a new version of “Hollow Man,” a fan-favorite track from Forever . “As I wrote this song, I was basically asking the heavens to make me a conduit,” Bon Jovi explained. “Give me the message, where am I going with this? I am the hollow man, fill me up with information and I’ll write it down. What do you sing when your song&#8217;s been sung?&#8221; After hearing the demo, Springsteen called Bon Jovi the next morning. “He says, ‘I can’t get that one out of my head,’” Bon Jovi recalled. “Now you know, you’re talking to not only your childhood hero but one of the great American songwriters of the last half century.” The Boss later agreed to lend his signature harmonica sound to the track. “I want it to be like that. Come and join my story,” Bon Jovi said. “He said, ‘I got it. Just leave it to me.’” T…",

    "body": "2Pac &#8216;s classic song &#8220;Brenda&#8217;s Got a Baby&#8221; was inspired by a true story &#8212; and the story continues. The rapper wrote the song addressing teen pregnancy in America&#8217;s ghettos while he was filming his star-turning role as Bishop in Juice after coming across a story in the news about a 12-year-old girl who threw her baby in a trash chute after being impregnated by her 21-year-old cousin. The track has since become one of the late entertainer&#8217;s most important records in his extensive catalog. Enter bestselling author Jeff Pearlman. During a recent appearance on The Rich Eisen Show to promote his new book Only God Can Judge Me: The Many Lives of Tupac Shakur , Pearlman dropped a bombshell after being asked if he came across anybody that didn&#8217;t want to talk to him when he was trying to put the book together. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get Dr. Dre or Snoop Dogg, but they&#8217;re hard to get anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I did find most people. The vast majority. Classmates, people who worked with him in music, even Death Row employees were pretty open about talking.&#8221; He then revealed that he &#8220;had a breakthrough very early on.&#8221; …",

The film has helped send Sphere Entertainment’s stock price into a new stratosphere. Shares of the Las Vegas venue’s parent company are up 58.4% year to date and have gained 56.4% since Sphere debuted its revamped version of the classic film.&nbsp; While some music stocks had big gains this week, the 19-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) fell 1.4% to 2,845.60, marking its fifth consecutive losing week. Three music companies had stock gains over 10%, but they are relatively small compared to the index’s largest companies, Spotify and Live Nation, both of which lost ground this week. Foreign exchange rates also played a role in the BGMI’s poor performance despite numerous music stocks posting gains. In the last week, the euro fell about 0.3% against the U.S. dollar while the Korean won lost approximately 1.2%.&nbsp; Related Sphere&#8217;s &#8216;Wizard of Oz&#8217; Hits New Box Office&nbsp;Milestone Charlie Puth Joining Anitta, Chris Martin &amp; More on Brazil&#039…",
