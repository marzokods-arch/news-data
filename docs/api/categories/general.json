From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance.

    "summary": "One UI 8.5 will be based on Android 16 QPR2, bringing several major new Android features to Galaxy devices.",
    "body": "TL;DR Leaked builds show Samsung’s next One UI 8.5 update, debuting with the Galaxy S26, will be based on Android 16’s second quarterly release (QPR2). This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence. We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

    "body": "TL;DR Photos of the Google Pixel “needlefish” have leaked online. Once rumored to be a Pixel 4 family member, the device sported a Snapdragon 855 with an X55 modem and 8GB of RAM. It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",
