    "body": "YouTube has been gradually expanding its AI age-estimation operations in the US over the past few months. It started in July, with the announcement that the platform would require users who didn’t seem sufficiently adult to verify they’re over the age of 18 before accessing all of what the platform has to offer. This month, yet more users got caught in YouTube’s age verification net. I’m on YouTube a lot: There aren’t many other places where I can get world news, live music performances, video game reviews, and in-depth explainers on how air conditioning works all in one spot. But YouTube’s invasive age estimation and verification practices are part of a troubling and growing trend — one that could drive me off the platform entirely.",

Back in August, Google launched Nano Banana , its Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model that went viral for doing a great job with human subjects and making it easier to tweak generated images (mostly). People used it for all sorts of creations, such as making mini-figurines for themselves and restoring old photos. Today, Google is introducing Nano Banana Pro based on Gemini 3 Pro Image, making its image model better than ever before. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s now $699.99 , down from $999.99, and it’s also the model my colleague Jonathan keeps around specifically for deep-cleaning carpets. He’s plenty of Eufy’s lineup at home, and the E28 is the one he calls a “mopping and deep-clean champ.” Part of the appeal is that the E28 isn’t just another vacuum-and-mop combo. The dock hides a detachable FlexiOne deep cleaner, essentially a portable spot-cleaning unit you can grab for carpets, stairs, and fabric messes the robot can’t reach. It’s an unusual two-in-one setup — the robot handles the whole-home route, and the detachable cleaner takes care of the stubborn stuff.",

    "body": "When I finished my studies and left my childhood home 15 years ago, the only piece of gaming hardware I brought with me was my PSP. Sony’s first portable console wasn’t just jam-packed with great games, it also served as my portable media player. In the age of smartphones and streaming services, it’s long been retired, but when I recently dug it out to revisit the memories, I was sad to see that the battery pack had swelled to a dangerous degree. Sure, I could buy a new battery pack, but instead, I moved on to a new handheld that perfectly captures and builds on what made the PSP great.",
