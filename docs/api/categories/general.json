    "body": "In the mid-&#8217;10s, Twenty One Pilots became one of the biggest crossover acts in pop music, scoring a trio of top five hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Billboard 200 with its Blurryface album. A decade later, the Pilots hadn&#8217;t matched that crossover success on either chart, with no additional top five singles and a number of top five albums, but no subsequent number ones. That is, until this week. On the Billboard 200 dated Sept. 27, the duo&#8217;s latest set Breach — marking the apparently final entry in the decade-long narrative the group started with Blurryface — bows at No. 1. The set posts 200k in first-week units, not only besting even its Blurryface total from 2015, but also bettering the debut number from any other rock album yet this decade. How did the duo manage this performance? And what other rock acts could rival that number in the years to come? Billboard writers answer these questions and more below. 1. Twenty One Pilots’ Breach debuts atop the Billboard 200 with a career-best 200,000 first-week units. On a scale of 1-10, how excited should Twenty One Pilots be about that performance?

The duo’s relationship began in early 2017, and has since brought&nbsp;cheating scandals; a secret marriage; kids Kulture&nbsp;Kiari&nbsp;Cephus, Wave Set Cephus and Blossom; and some hot collaborative tracks. Cardi and Offset secretly married on Sept. 20, 2017, before the&nbsp; Migos &nbsp;rapper proposed to her on stage at&nbsp;Power 99’s Powerhouse concert in Philadelphia in October that same year. According to the Fulton County Magistrate in Georgia, Cardi filed for divorce from Offset nearly three years later, on Sept. 15, 2020. The two eventually got back together weeks later, only for Cardi to file for divorce again in the summer of 2024. There have been accusations of infidelity on both parts, but the couple previously maintained their love for each other. From super lavish gifts bestowed upon each other (and their children) to making their videos family affairs (see &#8220;Jealousy&#8221;), Set and Cardi have been public about their feelings for each other, during both the peaks and valleys of their romance.

For them, it’s like music royalty,” Ciza tells Billboard .
