Earlier this year we uncovered signs that Google was working to restore this functionality. The PiP YouTube player has now started appearing for some Messages beta testers. When we spot Google working on a new feature for one of its apps, it’s often anyone’s guess just how long we’ll have to wait before it’s ready to go live — assuming it even does at all. That can be a matter of days, weeks, months, or longer. Today we’ve got some good news about a long-ago-spotted upgrade that finally looks like it’s nearly ready for prime time, as it starts hitting beta testers.

Successfully translating the songs and script of a beloved musical onto film is no easy feat, but the task was made even more challenging from Chu and his team when it was decided to bisect the story into two separate parts. It called for some creative solutions to build out Wicked: For Good into a story that can stand on its own, and as part of this retooling of the show&#8217;s second act, Chu and Dolman worked with composer Stephen Schwartz to craft two new songs — &#8220;The Girl in the Bubble,&#8221; sung by Grande, and &#8220;No Place Like Home,&#8221; sung by Erivo. There were other challenges for Chu as well — famously, the director opted for all of the songs to be sung live while filming, presenting a number of technological challenges when editing the film in post-production, and while trying to make the songs larger tha…",

Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other. Once Samsung or Google or Apple proves an idea is technically viable and, more importantly, marketable, the other players often move to implement it in their own products. Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

The expanded limit appears to be rolling out in the latest version of the app. Pinning keeps important chats visible, but if you’ve got 20 pinned, it might be time to reply to a few. Sometimes you get one of those texts that you don’t want to reply to right away, but also don’t want to forget about entirely as more messages arrive. That’s where pinned conversations come in handy, keeping your most important threads at the top of your inbox so they don’t get buried under new ones. Google Messages has long offered the pinned conversations feature, but now it’s turning it up to 11 — or, more accurately, to 20. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice.

I should know — I’ve had my hands on almost every foldable (and flip) phone to launch in the US or abroad since the start. Have I loved them all? Of course not, but I , along with the rest of the Android Authority team, have watched them steadily improve to the point where we’ll happily carry the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold or Motorola Razr Ultra as a daily driver over a traditional Android phone .",

If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.
