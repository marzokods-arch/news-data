As results rolled in throughout the annual broadcast on Saturday (Jan. 25), the Adelaide hip-hop trio’s latest entries pushed them ahead of Eilish on the tally, marking another milestone in the group’s enduring relationship with Australia’s most influential listener-voted chart. Hilltop Hoods have been fixtures of the Hottest 100 since the early 2000s, with songs spanning multiple eras of their career consistently finding favour with triple j voters. Their sustained presence across decades places them among a small group of Australian acts to repeatedly chart in the countdown, reflecting both their crossover appeal and deep-rooted connection to local audiences. Eilish, by contrast, has built her Hottest 100 footprint in a far shorter time frame, racking up entries since her breakout years and becoming one of the most successful international artists in the poll’s recent history.
