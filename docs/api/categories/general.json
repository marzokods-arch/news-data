    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Protecting our expensive new smartphone is a top priority for many of us, and online marketplaces are flooded with options, from cases to display protection . An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

The launcher was sold to analytics firm Branch Metrics in 2022, but by 2024, the company underwent mass developer layoffs. Only Nova Launcher’s founder, Kevin Barry, remained working on the launcher until September 2025, when he too left Branch. Now, there’s a glimmer of hope Nova Launcher might not be completely dead yet. Nova Launcher users spotted an unexpected version 8.1.3 update roll out on the Google Play Store beta channel, according to a post on Reddit’s Nova Launcher sub from user colinaspinall . As of now, the latest update hasn’t appeared through the stable release channel, or Nova Launcher’s official beta website . While the update is a sign someone at Branch is paying attent…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The leak came from a private Google Teams call that someone joined and screenshotted before posting on a GrapheneOS forum. Pixel devices running standard Android still allow limited data access before first unlock, but GrapheneOS versions appear to block it more effectively. Google Pixel phones already have a solid reputation for security, but leaked Cellebrite documents show they’re even harder to crack when running GrapheneOS , the privacy-focused Android alternative. Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer. During the meeting, the uninvited participant took screenshots of what appears to be an internal ‘Android OS Access Support Matrix’ and then shared them on the GrapheneOS discussion forum .",

Sheets support is currently limited to NotebookLM Plus users, i.e., those who subscribe to Google’s AI Plus or AI Pro plans. NotebookLM is easily one of Google’s most highly cherished AI tools , with fewer haters than any other of Google’s apps. It lets you research and process data from numerous different sources and convert verbose formats into digestible chunks, or even AI-generated podcasts and video essays. With an upcoming update, Google is set to improve file support for free users. Google Drive integration already lets you import files from Docs and Slides as sources to NotebookLM. But the research tool lacks support for Google Sheets (or .XLS and .XLSX files) in the free tier. Thankfully, if you’ve been yearning for the option to import your Sheets or Excel files to NotebookLM, Google may be bringing it to you soon.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Starting today, T-Mobile will only allow payment arrangements through the T-Life app. In-store and customer support call options previously required a fee, but have now been discontinued entirely. The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Those screens won’t integer scale DS games, and the SoC is too weak for the MelonDS emulator. The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

It wasn’t all bad for Verizon, as its prepaid, broadband, and business divisions grew, keeping its finances strong despite postpaid losses. The bigger picture is that T-Mobile is closing the gap on Verizon’s total subscriber count and could surpass it by late 2026 if trends continue. There was a time when Verizon was the undisputed king, both in network power and reach, as well as subscriber count. Over the past few years, Verizon has lost ground in network performance as T-Mobile pushes ahead by many metrics.

In addition to making voice typing much more efficient , Google has been experimenting with several Gboard tweaks, such as auto-switching to the English alphabet after you enter a symbol or punctuation mark. Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2.
