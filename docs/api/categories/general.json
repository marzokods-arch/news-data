One icon reads \"Cross-Buy\", while the second reads PS5/PC. \"New Symbols will be added soon (website & tool), but here [are] some nice new features from PlayStation\", Amethxst wrote. \"A kind of 'echo mode' 'PS5/PC games' and 'Cross-Buy'.\" While this initial post was difficult to verify, later, Amethxst followed this up with a video , in which they locate the symbols within the PS5's user menu, and it is much more convincing. Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store. Since the term \"Cross-Buy\" has been used by Sony since the PS-Vita days, Dealabs also checked when the new symbols were added to the store, and discovered they first appeared in June this year. Sony has yet to confirm the authenticity of these symbols. But PC/PS5 cross-buy would certainly fall i…",

YouTuber and minimalist hardware extraordinaire Vimpo has created a tiny custom Minecraft server implementation for machines with limited resources—and to show off its potential, they've got it running on a smart bulb , of all things. The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub . The server binary size is a mere 46 KB without the authentication library and 90 KB with it onboard, while the memory usage is sai…",

Which superhero do you go on a date with? Who do you drop from the team? But where Telltale games also retained rudimentary walk-around-and-look-at-stuff scenes from their point-and-click ancestors like vestigial limbs, Dispatch ditches them in favor of being more like an interactive cartoon—with high-quality animation and acting—until suddenly it drops you into a shift working as a dispatcher.

More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor. Regardless, it's remarkable that it runs at all—and not just because of the severe bottleneck. As the video highlights, Battlefield 6 requires Trusted Platform Module 2.0—a fe…",

When PC Gamer online editor Fraser Brown gave the game a spin , he said \"stepping into the sandals of my Greek hero felt like travelling back in time to a simpler era, when you could enjoy an ARPG without intense number crunching, theorycrafting or engaging in live service systems.\" In fact, he said in his impressions the game was occasionally so placid that it didn't quite live up to the grand stakes of Greek legend—though the game has been upping the ante with new regions and bosses since its early access launch.

In a Steam post diplomatically and not at all confrontationally titled PIVOT OR DIE\", Facepunch revealed it has implemented a game-wide blueprint wipe. While Rust already enacts general map wipes that remove player structures and so forth, the blueprint wipe also removes everything they've unlocked from the crafting tree. \"When you join a freshly map-wiped server but already have everything unlocked, you're effectively skipping the entire early and mid-game,\" Facepunch explains in a Steam post. \"You can craft late-tier items immediately, bypassing all the gear and choices before it, which completely breaks the sense of progression.\" Following this logic, Facepunch has wiped all servers and blueprints, ef…",

But when something becomes that ubiquitous, it's easy to take it for granted—and to simply stop thinking about it. How much do you really know about this program that you let control most of your gaming life? It's time to find out—and perhaps learn a fact or two along the way—with our latest quiz. We've plumbed the depths of the entire history of Steam, from its humble beginnings to its industry-defining present, and fished up a bounty of trivia to test you.

The result utterly entranced Sam Greer, who gave it a whopping score of 95 in her Hyper Demon Review . \"The dizzying heights you reach with each powerup and each foe overcome are virtually, and visually, euphoric,\" she wrote. \"The entire dark landscape of the world literally wraps around your vision, and as your field of view folds on itself you can funnel every creature into the sights of your wrath. One small misstep can still end you, but for a few, fleeting seconds you are unstoppable.\" One other key difference between Devil Daggers and Hyper Demon is that the latter had a multiplayer mode, though you'd be forgiven for not knowing this since it was left as a secret for players to discover. Now though, developer Sorath has made the multiplayer mode not just public knowledge, but public full stop, releasing it as a free, standalone game on Steam. Hyp…",

But developer Tomas Sala wasn't satisfied with the end product, and has spent the last year or so overhauling the game in his spare time from supporting his other game— Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles . The result released this week, a free update that, according to Sala, reworks \"literally everything\" about the game. Certainly, the changes are extensive. The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster provides a complete visual overhaul of the game, not only improving the lighting, visual effects, animations etc, but also reworking the world itself. Many of its cities and key locations have been remade, while others have been expanded to look grander and more impressive.

The exploit does, however, cause serious lag from the volume of enemies pouring in if you happen to be nearby, which might be enough for it to land on Blizzard's nerf radar.
