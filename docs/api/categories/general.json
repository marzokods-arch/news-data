    "body": "Florence + The Machine rang in Halloween with a fittingly eerie performance for SiriusXM’s The Spectrum , delivering a live mash-up of Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra” and their own fan-favorite deep cut “Which Witch.” The appearance doubles as a preview of their new era, with Florence Welch and company dropping their sixth studio album Everybody Scream on Oct. 31 and plotting a North American headline tour for 2026. The band’s take on “Abracadabra” — originally released by Gaga in February as part of Mayhem — merged seamlessly with “Which Witch,” a theatrical, chant-like track from the deluxe edition of How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful (2015). Welch’s vocals soared over gothic percussion and swelling strings, as the mash-up unfolded in true Florence fashion: dramatic, mystical, and steeped in raw emotion. The Halloween broadcast marks one of the first full performances tied to Everybody Scream , the group’s first full-length album since 2022’s Dance Fever, which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the U.K.’s Official Albums Chart . Described by Welch as a fever dream of “witchcraft, mysticism, magic, poetry, and insanity,” the new LP taps into themes of mortality, rebir…",

Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The carrier has now filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the self-regulatory body.

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

While BOOX’s new Palma 2 Pro looks the part but lacks full voice-calling support, the HiBreak S delivers connectivity and a starting price that makes it the most affordable color E Ink phone to date. The HiBreak S features a 5.84-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display, available in both color and black-and-white variants. The panel’s matte finish keeps reflections to a minimum, while a 36-level front light with adjustable color temperature makes it easy to read in any lighting. The E Ink technology naturally favors eye comfort and energy efficiency over motion smoothness, so users should expect crisp text and subdued colors rather than high-refresh visuals.",

The leak shows dark outlines outside Quick Settings tiles along with a subtle, glass-like interface. This adds to the list of features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest design changes in iOS 26, though it’s not entirely the same. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 software for Galaxy smartphones and tablets is set to bring several significant design changes over the current UI. One of these is a refreshed Quick Settings panel, which is expected to become more dynamic and customizable with this future update. Although One UI 8.5 is likely to arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series — and the beta isn’t coming for the whole of November either, plenty of leaks have given us an overview of these design changes. While a revamped Quick Settings panel has already been spotted in previously leaked builds of One UI 8.5, the latest leak gives us a better look at additional options it could bring. Tipster Tarun Vats shared a screenshot of the updated panel on X, showing that quick settings tiles for various shortcuts now have a thin outline. This is predominantly visible when…",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Gboard’s latest update adds a new flick gesture to speed up typing symbols. With the option enabled, you can swipe down on the alphabet keys to enter symbols. The option works alongside the Touch &amp; hold option that also lets you select symbols, but by long-pressing a key. Google has been testing various ways to make typing on Android devices feel as effortless as possible. In addition to making voice typing much more efficient , Google has been experimenting with several Gboard tweaks, such as auto-switching to the English alphabet after you enter a symbol or punctuation mark. Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2. The feature was spotted rolling out to the beta channel last month, and is now also available on the stable channel, as highlighted by 9to5Google .",

Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",
