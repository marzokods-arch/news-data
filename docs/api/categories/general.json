    "body": "Josh Sawyer has been making games professionally for 26 years. What started as a hobby, making and playing tabletop RPGs, has grown into a storied career. Sawyer had his first position in 1999 working at Black Isle Studios, and now serves as studio design director at Obsidian, where he led development on games like Fallout: New Vegas and Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. And yet, Sawyer believes job security for himself as well as other devs is worse than ever before despite his current position, as well as shipping so many well-respected titles over the years, \"In 26 years, I’ve never really felt secure in a job. Even now. Less so now, actually\", he tells the audience during a keynote at GCAP , a game development conference in Melbourne, Australia. \"That’s actually pretty messed up\" he adds, almost as though he’s realising it upon saying it out loud. The games industry is a vastly different space than it was 26 years ago when Sawyer began. Back then, teams of developers for AAA games were usually between 15-40 people, with almost everyone branching out across different skills and, more often than not, undergoing constant crunch to deliver. Halo: Combat Evolved, for example was a team …",

The PW5A3 is certainly a strong early option, alongside the SGX , but it wasn't my cup of tea at first. With some smart attachment choices, this SMG grew on me a ton for mid-range maps like Iberian Offensive and Siege of Cairo.

It's my most-used weapon so far, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you played the beta back in August, then this might not come as a surprise to you; the M4A1 was arguably the best gun then, and it still holds strong despite some changes since.

The best BF6 PW7A2 loadout takes advantage of this to create a flanking menace. While SMGs like the SGX and even the PW5A3 are capable of some pretty extraordinary feats at range, they pale in comparison to the PW7A2. Despite lower per-bullet damage, its significantly higher fire rate and unmatched handling more than make up for it. So, here's what you need.

The best BF6 L110 loadout is all about trying to control that torrent of projectiles, shackling the gun with some recoil control, while trying to keep it competitive with a fast aim down sight speed. The LMG is a bit of a weird gun in Battlefield 6, trumped at close range by SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines, but also at longer range by DMRs. So what does the L110 have going for it? Well, it's got a whole lot of bullets for one. While your opponent's mag might run dry quickly, you'll still be blasting away. If you can keep it accurate, it also has a decent TTK, especially if you manage to land headshots with the Hollow Point ammo I'm recommending. If you're using an LMG as Support (which you should be), you'll also get additional bonuses to ADS and sprint speed, helping to make things a tad more competitive.

    "body": "So, you've decided to become a sniper in Battlefield 6 . It's certainly one way to escape the rat race of TTK escalation and, if you're a rifle lover, the poor performance of DMRs relative to absolute murder machine SMGs, assault rifles, and carbines. Snipers can set up their own little spot and plink away, enjoying the atmosphere of the battlefield while ideally not drawing too much attention. The best BF6 M2010 ESR loadout is very different to its other weapon counterparts, where recoil control is one of the most important things. Instead, this setup focuses on adding handy tools to the rifle that speed up round rechambering, but also reduce weapon sway so you can land a long-range shot with more precision. Some of the best M2010 ESR attachments aren't available until a relatively high mastery (such as the DLC Bolt that allows scoped-in round rechambering), so you'll have plenty of points to spend as you're levelling to experiment with attachments either way. All that said, here's my preferred setup for the starting sniper rifle in Battlefield 6.

    "body": "While it's so compact that it could fit in your pocket, the SGX is a powerful SMG in Battlefield 6 . It's also the starter SMG, so you can hit the ground running with a strong contender, which arguably isn't the case for the assault rifle category. The best BF6 SGX loadout might make it look rather silly, but you can't argue with the performance. The SGX is described as aggressive and close-range with a high fire rate, and that's certainly true, but it's more reliable than it implies. This build tightens its recoil and handling to make it surprisingly versatile, though it's not quite to the same level as the M4A1 loadout or AK-205. Best SGX loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) I recommend the following attachments for an SGX build: Muzzle: Double-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Light 6\" Fluted (20) Underbarrel: Slim Angled (20) Magazine: 36RND Magazine (15) Ammunition: Standard (5) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) or OSA-7 1.00x (10) Accessory: 50MW Blue (20) Thanks to the SGX's already pretty superb handling straight out of the box, you don't need to do much in the way of recoil reduction. The Double-Port Brake and Slim Angled grip reduce overall recoil a tad, while the latter also spe…",

It's a big improvement over the measly launch offerings of BF1, BF5, and BF2042, and it makes progression significantly more rewarding. With so many weapons to unlock, both through career ranks and assignments, it's a no-brainer to sort the wheat from the chaff to find out the best guns . So, I've put every weapon to the test, including playing around with attachments, to help you out in the field. Best Battlefield 6 guns The best guns I've used so far in BF6 are: M4A1 (rank 2, carbine) M87A1 (rank 0, shotgun) PW7A2 (rank 19, SMG) DRS-IAR (rank 9, LMG) M277 (rank 11, carbine) SG 553R (Danger Close assignment, carbine) M4A1 The M4A1 carbine, unlocked at just Rank 2, is one of the best weapons in the entire game. Thanks to its high fire rate and solid damage, the M4A1 is capable of dropping enemies blazingly fast. Now, you might think that these positives must mean the M4A1 is weak at range. It should be, but it's not. With just a converter and vertical grip, you can negate most of the re…",

Which, given some of the releases so far this year, must come as a welcome relief for those of you running less than top-end hardware. I've had a chance to perform some early testing of Battlefield 6's performance on two of Nvidia's mid-to-upper-mid range GPUs, the RTX 4070 and RTX 5070 Ti , and I've got even better news for you—not only does the game look great, but it seems mercifully light on modern graphics cards at everything but the very top setting.

First things first: You may be thinking that this is not an anniversary of any sort for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which came out on December 9, 2024. And you would be correct. But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you—as long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits. The update will also add a new \"Cairo outfit,\" enabling Indy to travel the blistering heat of the d…",

The good news amidst the bad is that a demo for HOMM: Olden Era is now available on Steam , offering players access to the game's tutorial and three different singleplayer modes, using four \"very different factions\" of the six planned for the early access release.

Bridges and Ports was originally expected to launch in mid-2024, a few months after the release of the Beach Properties asset pack earlier that year.

Then it delayed Bridges and Ports again, to near the end of 2025 , because everything was a mess. But apparently now that's all been sorted, at least enough that the expansion can be unleashed on the public. The Bridges and Ports expansion will add 20 new drawbridges and lift bridges, customizable ports, a new Ferry Transport System, \"expanded maritime industries\"—fishing, offshore oil rigs, that sort of thing—and three new maps, more than 100 assets, and new achievements.

With how long it can take to level up gear, hardware boosters are just as important as your regular career XP boosts.
