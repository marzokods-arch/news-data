After that, she brought a full project &#8212; the Breakup Variety Hour live show &#8212; to famed Manhattan venue Joe’s Pub for a sold-out debut last October. Now, on Oct. 15, she’s headed back to Joe’s Pub – and beyond – to support The Breakup Variety Hour, her upcoming album which builds upon the show and its sly self-help premise. “I knew I wanted to make something that felt like more than just a collection of songs,” she explains. “I had been watching episodes and clips of The Cher Show…",
