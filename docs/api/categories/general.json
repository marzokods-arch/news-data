The Model M started out as a replacement for IBM's Model F keyboard that was previously bundled with its terminals. That became too expensive to produce, so IBM looked to replace it with a \"low cost, high volume\" alternative: the Model M. The first Model M (or then, the IBM Enhanced Keyboard) was the keyboard IBM threw in with its 3161 model terminal and, outside of the typewriter and industrial models, is the genesis for the keyboard in the mainstream with the features that have become ubiquitous elsewhere, most notably key placement for things like the Control and 'inverted T' arrow keys .

And hell, Epic was right: over 126,000 concurrent players flocked to it during its weekend stint, according to IGN , making it one of the most popular game modes on offer during that time. I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them. Sounds kind of fun in practice but hey, this is the internet we're talking about. What's an open voice chat without having a slur or two hurled your way, eh?

Another said the \"random loot pool\", including these new weapons and the recently added Shockwave hammer, felt like a \"feeble attempt to keep the season fresh\".

Naturally, you're not the only one who'll be sporting this new bit of kit. Other stalkers will be able to get their hands on NVGs, making nighttime excursions a bit more… exciting. The new NVG offset aiming feature should also make close-quarters gunfights a bit easier, allowing you to tilt your gun for improved handling. \"This tactical advantage redefines combat dynamics in the Zone's unforgiving terrain,\" says GSC. A new high-powered laser pointer has also been thrown into the mix, making it easier to hit y…",

    "body": "All things come to an end, though when it's related to tech, it often seems like the end comes quicker than the lifespan of a hamster. That might feel like it's the case with a move by Intel to end routine driver updates for all its graphics chips, bar its recent Alchemist and latest Battlemage GPUs. As explained in a knowledge base post , Intel has split its GPU drivers into two distinct packages: those for Alchemist and Battlemage-powered GPUs and a set for everything else from the past five years. In the case of the latter, that means the integrated GPUs in every 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Gen Core processors, as well as anything with an Iris Xe GPU. These will no longer receive game-specific updates, including 'day 0 support' (where a new game gets extra tweaks in the drivers to make it run properly at launch), and instead will just enjoy quarterly driver updates containing security or critical fixes. Unless it's super-critical, of course, in which case, updates will appear as needed. Given that gaming laptops are still being released in 2025 with 14th Gen Core CPUs, this might seem like a bit of a daft move by Intel. However, the gaming performance of the tiny iGPUs in all it…",

Riot just revealed that 2XKO will officially enter early access on October 7. No more closed beta, no more invite codes. The bad news is that it's still a PC-only deal—despite our PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S pals being included back in the 2024 beta, they're still being left out of the main event for now. There's no word on when the game'll go multi-platform just yet, unfortunately. (Image credit: Riot Games) But for those of us on PC, early access marks the start of 'Season 0' as well as the debut of 2XKO's 10th champion, which Riot is still keeping firmly under wraps.

Apart from the sheer portent of an original Apple I and the particular rarity of this version (it's thought there were only around 200 Apple I computers ever built, so this machine is in a very rarefied niche, even among Apple I's), the incredible condition of this example and the fact that it's fully functional ( as demo'ed in this YouTube video ) no doubt contributed to the hefty hammer price. The Apple I was of course the work of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and these \"Byte Shop\" machines are regarded as the turning point that made Apple Computer viable as a company. At the time in 1976, Jobs and Wozniak were selling a small handful of bare boards to enthusiasts. But Jobs approached Paul Terrell at the Byte Shop in Mountain View, California, an early personal computer outlet. Terrell apparently offered to buy 50 Apple I machines, but only if they came fully assembl…",

    "body": "As is the way with all islanders in Hello Kitty Island Adventure , your key to unlocking quests in Wheatflour Wonderland is by befriending the game's newest character, Cogimyun. This can be done through gift giving , but the game doesn't exactly give you any tips as to what her favourite items are. It can take a while to figure out what Cogimyun's two and three-heart gifts are as a result. Although you won't be able to give a bad gift, as the game only lets you select items which have at least one heart, if you're desperate to level up quickly you'll want to focus on higher value items. We've pulled together all of Cogimyun's one, two, and three-heart gifts to save you the struggle of discovering them for yourself. Best gifts for Cogimyun in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Similarly to every other character, you can only give Cogimyun three gifts per day, unless you use a Friendship Blossom to reset her daily gift allowance. When you start out in Wheatflour Wonderland, there are a few items you can pick up around the map to boost Cogimyun's friendship, such as Noodle Grass and any critter. These are great starting points, but it's best to not rely on them for too long. The following …",

Little Nightmares 3 is the first of the series to feature co-op, and after just 30 minutes of crawling through Necropolis, I've come to the stark realisation that the entire series, or at least the sections where there's already an NPC companion by your side, would've greatly benefited from supporting two players. You still have the option to play with an AI companion if you'd rather go alone.

See, throwing knives can have the \"Penetrator Augment\" rolled on them, which causes all damage to be critical damage for a few seconds.

According to Kojima speaking at the event, casting of the main character was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, but he did reveal three confirmed cast members. These include Don Lee (or Ma Dong-Seok) who has appeared in Eternals and Train to Busan. Charlee Fraser, best known for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, will also star alongside Minami Hamabe, who appeared in Godzilla Minus One. Here's the poster: (Image credit: Kojima Productions) Physint will use an advanced version of the Decima Engine that powers Death Stranding, as well as Horizon Zero Dawn and others. It's further out than even OD, which itself doesn't have a release date, though Physint is expected to release within six years. \"[Physint] will be both a game and a movie at the same time,\" Kojima said in February 2024. \"Of course it will be a game.

As they start to light the candles, weird, scary stuff starts to happen. Kojima reiterated how the game will blur games and film, without going into any specifics on exactly how. Spencer's comments were similarly unhelpful: he said that OD was innovating \"in gameplay, story and player engagement\". Microsoft is offering technical support on the project. It certainly looks a lot like P.T. The sound design is deliciously oppressive, and the footage is mostly first-person. Kojima wouldn't be drawn on how far into development the game is, so that's completely up in the air for now.

You sprint past one of the hundreds of half-naked walking corpses in the street, but even though you're several feet away from one of them and moving much faster than it is, it instantly latches onto you. Now instead of sprinting you're stopped in your tracks and you've got a gross monster trying to bite you in the face so you have to spend precious seconds punching it until it lets go. There's got to be a better way! The rank-and-file infected Dying Light: The Beast are never much of a threat: they're slow, they're loud, and they don't do much damage, but man they do know how to grab you. It sounds weird to complain about a zombie grabbing you in a zombie game, I know. But the frequency in which a zombie grabs you is way, way too high in Dying Light: The Beast. First of all, I'm Kyle Crane. I'm a big beefy boy made of muscles sprinting through a city on legs strong enough to propel me up the sides of buildings and launch people through the air when I kick them.

While it retains its unique bullet-hose, explosive personality, the Kaoson looks a little different than you might remember. Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses. If you want to add it to your collection (and you should), here's what you need to do. How to get the Kaoson in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm the Kaoson from Primordial Guardian Origo, the final boss of the Terminus Range vault . To access the Arch of Origo vault, you need to find all three vault key fragments in Terminus Range. Once inside, fight through three waves of enemies until you reach Origo. Like all bosses, you can use the nearby Moxxi's Big Encore machine to repeatedly farm Origo in hopes of getting a lucky Kaoson drop. Primordi…",

    "body": "It seems like the first gaming handheld with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 to hit the market will be GPD's Win 5, which works around the thermal and battery constraints of that beefy chip by popping an optional external battery on it. Early tests are all rather positive, despite that quirk. According to YouTuber The Phawx , the device feels \"comically light\" without the external battery, and he likes it a lot with the battery slapped on the back. He says, \"I just ultimately prefer the battery pack on at all times.\" Effectively, with the Win 5, you can either keep it plugged in all the time, or connect a battery to the back of the device via a port and locking mechanism. Think of how the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons work, with a clip letting them slide up and out. It is not, however, hot swappable, so plugging out the battery entirely shuts it down. The Phawx points out that the battery strapped onto the back covers some of the device's intake fans, though he hasn't had the chance to fully test the thermals yet. He did, however, notice the fans felt a little louder with the pack on. In exchange for this strange battery system, you get the full-fat Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, complete with 40 RDNA …",
