We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions. Sony’s not really a major player in the smartphone space these days, but this seems like the type of trend we should expect to see gain traction over the next c…",

Readers feel that Google Pixels, which are priced as flagships, largely lack the performance to justify the price tag. While some fans appreciate the AI features and software integration of the chip, many believe that its flaws outweigh its benefits. The recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 looks promising on paper, and Qualcomm seems poised for another successful year, securing its place among top Android flagships once again. Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C. Scott Brown is actually glad that Pixels don’t use Snapdragon . Much like he predicted, this opinion was highly controversial, and it seems a lot of our readers are done forgiving Tensor for its mediocrity. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance.

Last year, Google launched a Certified Refurbished Pixel Phone program that allowed customers to save up to 40% on available devices. Initially, this included the Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6, and Pixel 6a. Since then, the Pixel 7a was added to the list, the Pixel 6a was removed, and the Pixel 8 Pro made a brief appearance before getting taken off. Now the tech giant has removed a couple more devices.

Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now.

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Some popular airline companies have recently changed their rules around power banks. On some airlines, you’ll no longer be able to use or charge any kind of power bank while in the cabin. The rule change is in response to the growing number of power bank incidents. The thought of being stuck on a flight with nothing to keep you entertained is a nightmare. That’s why many travelers tend to bring power banks with them, so their devices stay juiced up as they move from point A to point B. But the next time you plan a trip, be sure to check the rules on power banks for your flight, as some airlines are becoming stricter about these charging devices.

    "body": "TL;DR New calendar sharing options are available in the Google Calendar app. You can now share and unsubscribe from calendars using your phone. These actions were previously only possible in the desktop Calendar interface. Early this year, we shared evidence that the Google Calendar app was cooking up new sharing controls , a change that would save users having to use the desktop interface to share calendars with others, as well as to unsubscribe from calendars you no longer want to see. Those changes are now rolling out widely. As of version 2025.38.0-809757839-release of Google Calendar, the app presents options to share individual calendars with other users or groups, right from your phone. The option isn’t terribly obvious, nested under Settings in Google Calendar’s side panel menu. But considering these actions weren’t possible in the app at all up until now, it’s definitely an improvement.",
