    "body": "While the February 27 release of Resident Evil Requiem is just a couple months away, we've only learned a few scraps of information about its plot, premise, and characters since its Summer Game Fest reveal. This week, that's changed ahead of schedule, thanks to Sony leaking details about Requiem's cast via the PlayStation store (via IGN ). Earlier today, players who've purchased non-deluxe edition digital copies of Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation store and checked for preload details were suddenly treated to updated cover art for the game. And that updated art just so happens to prominently feature our beautiful, spin-kicking son, Leon S. Kennedy. Here's a look: (Image credit: Capcom) Leon's potential inclusion in Requiem has been the subject of speculation since before its first reveal showed the blasted remains of his old Raccoon City stomping grounds—thanks in part to known RE leaker Dusk Golem , who's claimed that Leon is \"not the only playable character, but he is the main character.\" Until now, Capcom has remained thoroughly insistent that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, even as early demos left some of us—like PC Gamer's Morgan Park —with the distinct…",

Apparently it has not—yes, I checked—but it has, as PC Gamer wordsmith Joshua Wolens put it in September, reached \"unprecedented levels of leaked.\" Yet somehow, it now is even more leaked. The latest leakage comes by way of PEGI , the Pan European Game Information agency, which has helpfully provided an 18 rating for something called Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced. There's little more to be gleaned from the rating at this point, except that the game has violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. (Image credit: PEGI) I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment, because as far as I know it has continued to steadfastly refuse that any of this is happening. And while I typically cast such requests into the ether with no real hope that my existence will even be acknowledged, much less responded to, in this case I feel like maybe Ubisoft is ready to throw up its hands and finally cop to the whole thing.

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more. It all combines seamlessly, both visually and mechanically—whether I've built the ultimate predator, or (more often) one of God's mistake…",

The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s. For the record, the read IOPS are 550K, the writes 650K. Those are pretty comparable to figures you'd expect from a full M.2 drive with the same two-lane PCIe 4.0 interface. And despite the fact that you can get faster PCIe 4.0 drives with four lanes, let alone even quick…",

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix.

Starsand Island is full of those fuzzy cosy farming sim familiarities,. Despite it doing almost nothing new, I \"one more'd\" myself through all 10 days of its extended press demo anyway. Starsand Island reminds me a whole lot of the Rune Factory games—janky 3D animations galore, anime art out the wazoo but with a charming Eastern vibe that makes me overlook the weirdness that seems to inevitably come from adding a third dimension to farming sims these days. (Image credit: XSeed Games) I was given a map, a rickety small farm, and a whole lotta freedom from minute one which was mighty refreshing. No going around introducing myself to every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the island. There's just a bit of hand-holding with some introductory quests, and the encouragement to go and become certified in a number of professions. These professions cover the standard go-to farming sim stuff: farming, exploration, crafting, fishing, and ranching. Each one is headed up by a mentor—and oh, god dammit, I'm going around the island introducing myself to everybody without even realising. Th…",

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings. At just 194 grams, it feels impossibly light compared to most gaming headsets, yet it barely shifts on your head du…",

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",

We're not just getting a new character, of course, though Season 20 is, I hate to say it, another oddly small update. Stadium fans like myself certainly have the better deal, too. Below, I'll go over when you can play Overwatch 2 Season 20, and everything you can expect to sink your teeth into. Overwatch 2 Season 20 release date and time OW2 Season 20 begins on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, at 11 am PT / 2 pm EST / 7 pm GMT , which coincides with the usual update time for the game in your region.

The Zagreus Journey mod adds a third option to your choice of how to leave the Crossroads, a Chaos Gate labeled \"Descend into Nightmare\". Jump inside and you'll be back in Tartarus, with all the old shades and traps to contend with, before working your way up through Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx. Even the original game's soundtrack is carried over. What isn't carried over is Zagreus himself, and so you'll be playing as Melinoë (and whichever familiar you bring), with one of her keepsakes equipped, and encountering the pantheon and earning the boons of Hades 2.
