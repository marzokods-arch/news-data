The executive claims that customers are “eager to buy into” the successor. My colleague C. Scott Brown put down his $100 deposit for the Trump phone seven months ago, and it still hasn’t turned up . At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson. Speaking to Wireless Dealer Magazine at the time, Hendrickson teased a second phone before the first one had made it into customers’ hands.",

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time.

Epic will pay Google for services; Google gets deeper access to Unreal Engine and will help promote Epic’s products on Android. Judge James Donato questioned if this deal diluted Epic’s fight for broader Android reforms. After years of heated antitrust battles , Google and Epic Games have shocked the tech world with a secret, massive partnership now coming to light. The surprise was revealed during this week’s court hearing, when it emerged that the two rivals had agreed to an $800 million, six-year strategic partnership, The Verge reports. Epic’s CEO Tim Sweeney hinted at the news on X , calling it “spicy details from the Epic v. Google settlement hearing!”",

Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button.

These complaints span across multiple Pixel devices, but we’re seeing the majority of reports for the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 10 series.

Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

However, when your flagship Pixel doesn’t have a feature that another brand already offers, it’s not unrealistic to hope that Google will introduce it to its own lineup sooner rather than later. With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

    "body": "TL;DR A screenshot from Samsung’s Good Lock team reveals a dedicated Quick Panel toggle for the Privacy Display feature in One UI 8.5. It’s expected to work with Samsung’s new M14 OLED panel and Flex Magic Pixel tech to physically narrow viewing angles. From an angle, the screen should appear black, while the user still gets a normal, bright view head-on. If you usually buy those dark, grainy privacy screen protectors as soon as you get a new phone, you might want to wait before ordering one for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Samsung seems ready to fix your shoulder surfer problem with hardware, and now there’s software evidence to prove it. After months of rumors about the Flex Magic Pixel technology , a new slip-up from Samsung has effectively confirmed the existence of a built-in Privacy Display. A screenshot shared by the Good Lock team (via Tarun Vats) shows a new quick toggle for this feature in an early version of One UI 8.5 .",

We got genuinely useful upgrades like increased use of silicon-carbon batteries and more phones flirting with Qi2-style magnets, but it also felt like a lot of brands spent the year moving sideways rather than forward. We have some insight on the subject, but we also wanted to know what our well-informed readership thought, so we decided to poll you on which Android OEM had the best year overall. To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",

Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.
