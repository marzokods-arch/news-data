Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and even Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts have essentially doubled their daily concurrent players on Steam since Fallout Season 2 started airing on Prime Video in December. Via SteamDB , we can see that in the weeks leading up to the show's premiere in mid-December, Fallout 4 was typically averaging about 20,000 concurrent players, but as of Sunday that count had risen to over 40,000. Likewise, Fallout: New Vegas was pulling in roughly 8,000 concurrents a day, and that rose to nearly 20,000 last weekend. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Even Fallout 3, which was typically attracting a mere hundred or so concurrent players on Steam on an average day, has risen to close to 200—not exactly a towering number, but still about double what it was before Fallout Season 2 started. Fallout 76 got a bump too, up to about 30k from the usual 10-20k average, and the original Fallout saw an influx of players as …",

The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too. Let's get into the numbers: according to Phison, \"E37T achieves up to 14.7 GB/s sequential reads and 13.0 GB/s sequential writes, with up to 2,000K 4 KB random IOPS.\" Bein…",

The Dark Rock 6 comes with six heat pipes and a single 135 mm Silent Wings fan. Meanwhile, the Pro is on a whole other level with none fewer than seven heat pipes. How about that? It also has two Silent Wings fans of unspecified size—though I'd guess from the images provided that they're also 135 mm. Both coolers offer a sleek all-black appearance, with a shroud covering the top and sides of the heatsink.

The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is where tech vendors like to go ape with new products, as well as showcase their regular updates and fresh models. When it comes to graphics cards, though, they tend to be all very much of the same design and look. Which is possibly why Gigabyte's designers have just a tad…unusual… with their new RTX 5090 graphics card. Specifically, it's the Aorus GeForce RTX 5090 Infinity . As GPU names go, that's actually very understated, which is the polar opposite of the card's appearance. Gigabyte isn't offering a full suite of images for the card just yet, but I don't think it's going to look any better from a different angle. And even if it did, you're never really going to see those angles once it's installed inside your gaming PC. It immediately gave me the impression of an 1980s beatbox: a hulking cassette player, with bulbous speakers to annoy your friends and family with. I hope, for the sake of anyone considering…",

Well, chalk up another win for the Dootster. As noted by GamesRadar , the good doctor has completed his no-hit run of Dark Souls the first, attaining hitless victory over Gwyn, Lord of Cinder with a song in his heart and also in his saxophone. Combine that with his previous no-hit wins in Dark Souls 2 and 3 (and Elden Ring, by the by) and you've got the full combo: a hitless, sax-based run of the entire Souls trilogy, a feat presumably unparalleled through all human history. To be fair, Gwyn went down like a chump. Dr Doot was using a sorcery build that made total mincemeat of the old guy. Rather than a nailbiter finish, it was more of a one-punch (one-doot) man situation. Still, our hero was rightly pleased with his achievement. \"The World's First Sax-Controlled Dark Souls No-Hit Run has been DOOTED!\" wrote Dr Doot in a post on X. \"I just beat Dark Souls without getting hit by a single ene…",

From the lush greens of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to the smattering of golds, blues and black in Death Stranding , he has spent decades working on games that stand out from the first screenshot. It's no surprise then that Asus' most recent collaboration with the creator looks pretty snazzy. Announced at CES 2026, Asus' collab with Kojima Productions includes custom colourways for the ROG Delta II gaming headset, Keris II gaming mouse, Scabbard II mouse mat, a custom carry case, and finally the ROG Flow Z13 . This collaboration is a very white and gold affair, with iconography largely left to Kojima Productions' iconic Ludens character. Designed by long-term Kojima collaborator and Kojima Productions lead artist Yoji Shinkawa, Ludens is somewhat of a high-tech knight figure and effectively the mascot for the company. Shinkawa says, \"I wanted to create a gadget that belongs to Ludens\", and he says the tech \"has its essence.\" The only real letdown for me here is the presence of the ROG Flow Z13. We tested the laptop/tablet hybrid early last year, and its beefy Ryzen AI Max is underpowered for su…",

That's because vendors use basic items for cases and fans to cut costs wherever possible. But what happens when a PC manufacturer doesn't skimp on the goodies and goes all out to impress? Well, you get something like the new Asus ROG G1000 : a hulking monster of a rig with three holographic fans. Asus calls the setup AniMe Holo, claiming that it's the \"world’s first holographic fan system in a prebuilt gaming PC\". The G1000 boasts one 380 mm fan with 720 LEDs and two 215 mm fans with 404 lights. These don't blast air around the PC; instead, they spin up to a point where you visually can't see the blades in motion and via a button on the top panel (or through Asus' Armoury Crate software), signals are sent to the lights to create patterns, animations, and so on before your eyes. I'm doing a poor job of describing it, so watch Asus' video above to get the full picture (if you pardon the pun). Whether it looks as crisp as that in real life is anyone's guess, but the general consensus in the PC Gamer HW office is that it looks kinda neat. Of course, having such b…",

Now, two years after its initial announcement, Nvidia has announced an update to the tech which should mean more blur reduction. Oh, and there are actually monitors supporting the tech, now. Perceived motion blur on a monitor, to simplify a little, is essentially caused by the perception that pixels are still hanging around in their previous position after they've moved on to their new spot. That's not really what's happening, of course. This can either be caused by a a slow pixel transition to a new value, or it can be caused by our eyes still holding on to the previous frame for a little too long after the image has changed.
