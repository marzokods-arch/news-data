    "body": "Miley Cyrus is looking back on some of the controversies that marked her early career. In a teaser for an upcoming interview on CBS Sunday Morning , airing Oct. 5, the 32-year-old pop star responded to a question from host Tracy Smith about the backlash she faced from angry moms during her transition from Hannah Montana to a more provocative music career. &#8220;I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess,&#8221; Cyrus says in the clip, shared on CBS Sunday Morning ’s Instagram . &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know until I was older, actually, how brutal it really was.&#8221; Cyrus first rose to fame as the star of Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana , which debuted in March 2006 to a record-breaking 5.4 million viewers — the highest in the network’s history at that time. She was just 13 years old when she played Miley Stewart, a teenager leading a secret double life as a Malibu student by day and a global pop star by night. The show ran until 2011. After her success on the show, Cyrus made a bold transformation with a more edgy and provocative image, releasing albums like 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed and 2013’s Bangerz , the latter debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Despite the ba…",

Not only did the Kiwi pop star &#8212; fresh off of a devastating heartbreak and in the trenches of gender discovery and body-image issues &#8212; craft much of Virgin with producer Jim-E Stack after relocating to NYC four years ago, she also channeled the city&#8217;s energy into every facet of the album. Lead single &#8220;What Was That&#8221; features a reference to Brooklyn venue Baby&#8217;s All Right, while &#8220;If She Could See Me Now&#8221; calls back to ancient horses &#8220;running up Prince Street&#8221; downtown. And when it came time to promote Virgin , Lorde made her TikTok debut with a video of herself walking through Washington Square Park in the West Village, which would later become the site of a frenetic music video shoot costarring a swarm of fans. With all of that in mind, the singer&#8217;s Ultrasound World Tour stop at MSG felt like nothing short of a homecoming show (even if Lorde is actually from New Zea…",
