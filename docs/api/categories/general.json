The tool would enable users to draw and add text directly to generated images within the interface, eliminating the need for external apps. Users will also be able to use markup to instruct Gemini on what changes to make. Google’s Nano Banana Pro model , based on the Gemini 3 Pro Image, is one of the best tools available today for generating images. My colleague Mishaal Rahman tried out Nano Banana Pro and walked away impressed . The image model is great for creating and editing images, but you’ll still need to use another app to add annotations manually.

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots. Pixel users can now create a 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspot by going to Se…",

It spoke directly to kids their own age. Leader Yihyeon, born in 2006, followed by Kumi and Mia of 2007, then the youngest Benny, born in 2008 — their world isn’t built on nostalgia. It’s happening now, in real time, in the thick of growing up. While many rookie girl groups gravitate toward hyperpop or dreamy, synth-washed ease, Baby DONT Cry arrived with something bolder: crystal-clear, straight-shooting K-pop energy. The group is also notable as the first girl group launched by P NATION, home to musicians like Crush and Hwasa. Their five-part documentary series on YouTube opens with none other than PSY telling the girls, “You’re a team now.” Yes — that PSY.

In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for.

When it comes to smaller Android gaming handhelds with enough power for demanding systems, your options are surprisingly limited. The Odin 2 Mini was one of the first to really fill that niche, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 packed into a relatively small frame with a 5-inch screen. But now, that device is no longer on the market. Confirmed by a representative on Discord , the AYN Odin 2 Mini has been discontinued and removed from the company’s website. This was not announced in advance, nor was it made public on any of the company’s channels.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Messages is working to give you the option to open shared media immediately upon saving it. The app may also change how it communicates location sharing, and possibly offer live updates. Gemini could get a little more prominent, thanks to a larger floating button. Google’s constantly updating its Android apps, but not every change is going to have a monumental impact. Far more often, developers are just trying something new to see what they can improve, tweaking app UIs with new menu listings, button placements, and screen layouts. Even those seemingly small changes are of interest to Android enthusiasts like us, and today we’ve collected a few of them that are in the works for Google Messages .

Google’s also considering some reorganization for a few of Gemini’s menu options. AI tools like Gemini have proven their usefulness in plenty of situations, but despite their flexibility, sometimes we’re going to want to keep our interactions with them really focused and compartmentalized. That’s exactly why ChatGPT supports projects: smart workspaces that keep all your conversations and files for what you’re working on siloed up together. Earlier this year we spotted Gemini working on what looked like a similar project solution of its own , and now we’ve got a little progress to share.
