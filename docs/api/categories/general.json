His representative denied any wrongdoing to CBS , saying there “was nothing improper” about the call.

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

More importantly, it uses Gemini’s Nano Banana to help you create custom artworks. The frame is available in three sizes, ranging from 7.3 to 31.5 inches. AI has become the definitive buzzword for a wide range of technologies, gadgets, and software. But it may now be making way into our homes in an unusual way. SwitchBot, known for products that help you smart-ify various dumb aspects of your home — and also for quirky household robots disguised as stuffed toys — is now bringing AI to the humble photo frame . SwitchBot has launched a new digital photo frame, called AI Art Frame, which it previously showcased at the IFA 2025 trade show in Berlin. Unlike a regular photo frame, this one is far more than a mere screen on the wall. Instead, it features a colored E-Ink Spectra 6 display with a paper-like texture and vivid colors that make your photos look like actual posters.",

Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship.

While the memory capacity remains unchanged from the Galaxy S25, we might see an upgrade in RAM speed. With this, Samsung may be aiming to utilize the highest transfer speeds supported by its LPDDR5X RAM chips. The Galaxy S26 has been leaking left, right, and center , and there’s no stopping. We’ve come to know virtually everything about the new phone series, even with at least two months left to Samsung’s grand Unpacked event . While the Galaxy S26 may largely resemble the Galaxy S25 series, especially in terms of aesthetics , some of its internal components are likely to receive a significant upgrade. According to leaker Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 series is slated to feature a minimum of 12GB of memory across its different models. While that specification is identical to the Galaxy S25’s RAM capacity, the upcoming flagship phones could feature faster memory.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s upcoming “tri-fold” foldable could have a 5,600mAh battery and a 6.5-inch cover screen, according to a Korean outlet. The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Frequent changes to product plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge and Galaxy S26 Plus have delayed Samsung’s design and production timeline. It would be a slight understatement to say that Samsung’s plans for its upcoming flagships are all over the place. We first heard that the Galaxy S26 launch is reportedly set for February 2026 in San Francisco. A subsequent leak disagreed with this timeline, stating that the company had managed to pull itself together and is now gunning for a late January launch .

Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Disney, although hesitant, might have to oblige to reduce its losses and restore investors’ confidence ahead of its earnings call tomorrow. Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions. With its subscriber count estimated to be over 9 million in the US, that’s a cumulative loss of nearly $200 million for the tech giant. The los…",

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
