Not only that, but each game in the collection has been updated so a cross-platform co-op game between a Steam user and an Epic Games Store user is a little less finicky. Now, when you boot up Trine 1 through 4 on Steam, you'll be prompted to optionally link your Steam and Epic accounts for cross-platform friend invites and achievement progress. The series' headlining feature is its three-player co-op, so this should make playing with anyone who just got the games due to this promotion easier. If you haven't played Trine, it's a The Lost Vikings-style puzzle platformer with three characters: a bumbling but burly knight, a thief with grappling hooks and a bow, and a wizard who can generate cubes and platformers. In solo play, you can only control one character at a time, but in multiplayer, all three characters are on screen at once. It gets chaotic quickly, but that's the fun bit; the puzzles are good, but rarely major head scratchers. They were decently popular on Steam when they first hit…",

And while that's meant I've been able to regularly game on an RTX 5090 Founders Ed .

I'm a simple fella, easily swayed by a mix of beautiful form and exquisite function, and the little Razer lad has both to offer in spades. And it's also a sign that the US/Singaporean company listens to its users and does pay attention to the market, even if it's seemed resolutely aloof in the past. That's because the last-gen version really wasn't great, and this feels almost like an apology in laptop form. I have no business body-shaming anything, but Blade 14s of 2023 and 2024 were rather portly gents, and far too thick to be a genuinely pleasing compact gaming laptop. Asus saw this, too, …",

When a whole new generation of graphics cards is going to drop, it energises the entire PC gaming hardware industry; people are going to upgrade, new laptops will arrive, and companies will refresh their entire PC lineups. It's big. Which is why it was a real shame that the launches of both AMD and Nvidia GPUs this year were such a nightmare. Issues with drivers, hardware, and above all, pricing and availability made it hard to enjoy the thrill of new gaming tech. So, in a mess of a launch, who gets the nominations for the best graphics card of 2025? Well, thankfully the rest of the year took care of the failures of launch time, with all the new GPUs becoming far more affordable and far closer to MSRP (in some cases even below!), and now widely available, too. Just in time for the RAMpocalypse to strike and push prices up on anything that has any little bit of memory inside it. Hint: that means everything.

That's a roguelike, baby, no matter how many old habits FromSoftware plugged into it . To me, a soulslike isn't about how chunky the dodge roll is or whether you have a stamina bar—it's about the slow, tense exploration of a dangerous world. It's about deliberate and hard-won mastery over mechanics and, more to the point: It's about the boss fights, baby. Big, satisfying walls to slam your head against, where the only thing between victory is you and your own personal skill, not whether you got Let Me Solo Her in your fireteam or lucked into a busted build. But hey, you know what is a soulslike? Lies of P . You know what DID have a DLC come out this year? Lies of P.

Loot is king in PoE 2, as it is in any other action RPG, but it's also apparently optional if you're playing a monk with the power to shock bosses in one swift strike. IsfooPoE's build requires nothing but a set of unarmed skills that do a surprising amount of damage without any items to supplement them. Their fight against Arbiter of Ash is mighty impressive to watch, mostly because it's the clearest example of the soulslike bones in PoE 2. IsfooPoE dodge-rolls out of the bosses swings like they're in a FromSoftware game. The boss has the power to set the entire room on fire and it still can't land many hits on a dude wearing nothing but a t-shirt and pants. The high damage largely comes from a skill that triggers lightning strikes when you dash. Those lightning strikes then explode the ice walls isfooPoE puts around the boss.

The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas. If nothing else, it seems like the second episode will lean in even harder to the over-the-top comic book action.

Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard .

I should know, I've been testing loads of them (along with the rest of the PCG hardware team) on a near-weekly basis. We put every headset we review through the ringer, judging it not just on audio quality, but on comfort, build quality, connection options, and much, much more. So when it comes to picking just three, it's been something of a tough call. Still, first and foremost has to be the Fractal Design Scape , a headset with a clever magnetic wireless charging system that's been something of a game changer for me, and takes pride of place on my desk. Ah, if only the Scape had its own way. Extremely tough competition, though, comes in the form of the Razer BlackShark V3 , an updated model that managed to knock the long-reigning HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless from its top cable-free spot in our best gaming headset guide when we reviewed it earlier this year.

In the old days I had no choice but to resort to amateurishly recording sound tests onto tape so I could carry some sweet chiptune bangers with me at all times. In more recent years I've gone spelunking in places like iTunes, but inconsistent regional availability, seemingly random tags that omit or misspell an artist's name or list soundtracks under a generic publisher label can make game music frustratingly hard to find. Thankfully, things are getting better—and especially on Steam. I can buy and listen to standalone soundtracks in a click or two. Capcom has enthusiastically embraced this new distribution method, offering over 100 albums on its store page , from headliners like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6 to games' that aren't available on Steam.

After all, the basic archetype for a good one is pretty much sorted at this point—a comfy headband, two earcups, a microphone, and a great set of drivers. I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting.

The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls. In recent years, we've seen plenty more experiments, with last year's Animal Well winning no shortage of praise by trading combat for ARG-adjacent layers of puzzling and cipher-cracking.

Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap.

An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed. Games that don't mind if you only play them once in a while. Games that let you make your own fun, encourage cooperation, or earn our respect by not bombarding us with ads. Welcome to the FPS vibe shift. Here's how it happened: Vibe shift: The biggest FPS of the year was Battlefield (Image credit: E…",

    "body": "I am the survival crafting menace of my friend group—the person in Discord always suggesting we go play in a new sandbox when we haven't even finished building castles in the last. It's like being friends with a sentient Steam Discover, but for some reason I can only recommend games where we're each given a Barbie and a pile of Legos. This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things. And if you give me a monotonous little chore to do on the side? That's just icing on the cake. It's an unfortunate way to be when most games checking those boxes have no clear end, though it does explain why I've got a growing list of survival crafting playgrounds I'm taking with me into 2026.

Every year, vendors fill the market with a veritable mass of new motherboards, all vying for your attention and wallet. There are so many that it would be almost impossible for anyone to review and test them all (unless they gave up eating and sleeping for 12 months), but we managed to get through nearly 20 of them. Some of them were actually launched last year, but they're still relevant in 2025, because of the way that motherboards follow CPU release cycles. AMD and Intel released their latest generation of processors in 2024 ( Ryzen 9000 , Core Ultra 200S ), and the first series of motherboards that came with them were all sporting the high-end chipsets (i.e. X870/870E and Z890). The mainstream chipsets (AMD's B850 and Intel's B860) didn't really appear in great numbers until the start of this year. Common features that we all loved to see were: Wi-Fi 7, lots of fast M.2 slots for SSDs, user-friendly BIOS/UEFI interfaces, and quick-release mechanisms on the main PCIe slot for graphics cards and M.2 heatsinks. We also saw big improvements in the rear IO p…",

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . As unfair as it may be, snap judgments serve a purpose in a gaming landscape where over 1,000 games (at least ) launch on Steam every month. I know, 'never judge a book by its cover', but what about 10,000 books by their covers and a few screenshots? As ashamed as I am to admit it, there's a good chance Goodnight Universe would have never gotten onto my radar if it wasn't for the fact that I was familiar with Before Your Eyes , the game that came before it. I'm glad it did, because otherwise I would have missed out on one of the best games of the year. If I could attach that judgment to a single focal point, I'd say it's Goodnight Universe's use of your webcam. And, well, the fact that you play as a baby. Okay, there's a lot going on.

One measure of how hard you've fallen for a game is the extent to which you'll overengineer solutions to its puzzles, out of sheer giddiness. So it was with Counterfeit Monkey's letter remover—a sort of linguistic edition of the sonic screwdriver. First I pulled a \"chard\" from its roots in a garden, and removed its \"h\", transforming the vegetable into a \"card\". Then I deleted the \"r\", causing a sputtering, ramshackle yet functioning \"car\" to spring into being in its place. From a piece of \"garbage\", I magicked an entire \"garage\" out of nowhere, replete with a somewhat bemused mechanic—who pointed out that my vehicle needed fuel. And with a sprig of \"sage\" and the use of a mirror, I eventually managed to reverse the nature of an object and wind up with \"gas\" for the car.

    "body": "Gear of the Year (Image credit: Future) Check out more of the year's best tech in our PC Gamer Hardware Awards 2025 coverage. It's been a relatively quiet year for new gaming CPUs, as AMD and Intel launched the bulk of their latest processors back in 2024. Ryzen 9000-series chips first appeared in the summer, with the Core Ultra 200S range making an appearance a few months later in October. Since then, retailers' listings have mostly been filled with non-overclockable or low-power versions, but AMD did drop a few niceties for us in 2025. Admittedly, most of them weren't much of a surprise, as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was expected right from the launch of Zen 5. And the same is somewhat true of the Ryzen AI Max and Max+ processors, better known as Strix Halo. AMD announced them at CES , and we didn't have to wait too long before we saw mighty APUs in use in the Framework Desktop and even in some handhelds . The real surprise was the Ryzen 5 7500X3D . Basically just a cut-down Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it pretty much popped out of nowhere in November, and given that AMD had already launched the Ryzen 5 7600X3D in August, few folks expected another version of it (we're still waiting for a Zen 4 ve…",
