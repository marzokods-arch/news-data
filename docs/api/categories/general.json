Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps.

Right now, you can only change the icon from the navigation screen. Choosing it before setting off would mean you can give the road your full focus. Google Maps already lets you swap that little blue arrow for something that feels a bit more like your own ride, whether that’s a sporty hatchback or a pickup truck. The catch is that you can only do it once navigation has started. However, we’ve unearthed clues that this might be about to change.

Instead of seeing options on the map, you could choose them from a list, and also filter those results. The new filters also appear to be in the works for Maps on Android Auto. Plans change, but when they do, Google Maps is ready to roll with the punches. Even if we’re already in the middle of a journey, Maps makes it easy to search for new destinations along our route, and add them as new stops in just a couple taps. While that works great, Google has never been one to leave well enough alone, and we’ve spotted the company’s developers working on what looks like a new approach to how we add destinations like that.

The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

While pricing is not yet available, the app promises savings over separate subscriptions. Users will have to manually cancel their existing subscriptions first if signed up through third parties. Update, October 16, 2025 (12:11 PM ET): We saw this one coming a couple weeks ago, and today Apple and NBCUniversal are making the bundle official: Starting October 20, you’ll be able to subscribe to both Apple TV and Peacock Premium for just about $15 a month, or Apple TV and Peacock Premium Plus for $20. Original article, October 3, 2025 (11:04 AM ET): You’d be forgiven for wincing a little anytime you see the name of one of your favorite streaming services pop in a news feed, as how often is it good news? If it’s not upcoming shows being shelved over fears of upsetting just the worst people, it’s news of price hike after price hike driving up your monthly bills. Today we’d love to break from that pattern with some actual good news — even if we don’t quite have all the salient details just yet.",

The app can already splice together clips around a certain theme to make short-form videos about your own life, and now, we’ve found evidence that that capability is expanding. Experimenting with version 7.50 of the Google Photos app on Android, we managed to enable an updated version of the highlight video editor. This new iteration comes with a bunch of new templates that include pre-selected music, as well as the option to add custom text overlays.",

    "body": "Credit: Ohsnap TL;DR MCON, a unique sliding mobile controller that attaches via magnets, is now available for purchase. It features TMR sticks, analog triggers, gyro controls, flip-out handles, an optional dock for external displays, and more. Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

    "summary": "Is five months enough time to judge the success of a new flagship phone line?",
    "body": "Samsung took a swing at the thin-and-light smartphones category with the Galaxy S25 Edge , releasing the phone before Apple could release the iPhone Air . Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August. Even the lowest-selling S25 Plus sold many times more than the Edge, but with the advantage of having launched earlier in the year.",

The phone also features special color tuning by camera brand Ricoh and is realme’s first phone with a special partnership. Innovation is dead, one could easily argue in the context of phone designs. In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears. OnePlus’ sister brand, realme, has just begun teasing its upcoming flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 .
