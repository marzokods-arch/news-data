It is, it must be said, a bit of a miserly trial. No full week here, instead you get just three days to enjoy all the fruits of premium, after which it's either pay up or sling your hook. You can choose a trial for both Nexus' monthly and yearly plans. Just to be clear, the only difference there is whether it charges you for a month or a year when the trial ends if you don't cancel. You'll also need to enter valid card details to make it all work. You've done this dance before—it's how free trials work pretty much anywhere else online. What does Nexus premium actually get you? Well, the number one feature as far as I'm concerned is uncapped download speeds. As it stands, Nexus users who use an adblocker can download at a mere 1.5MB/s.

The settlement is composed of a $1 billion civil penalty, with an additional $1.5 billion in refunds to be paid back to consumers affected by such practices. Amazon is further required to \"cease unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices for Prime,\" which will be interesting. This is one of those where surely we're all thinking \"too right.\" I have a Prime subscription, and a few extras, but have noticed Amazon on occasion charging me up for things I didn't sign up for: I was particularly annoyed when one of my children was able to sign up for an expensive multi-device Amazon Music package via Alexa.

It's technically a legendary shotgun, sitting alongside greats like the Hot Slugger , Hellwalker , Rainbow Vomit , and Convergence , but it's also everything . The Bod's whole deal is that it counts as a shotgun, assault rifle, sniper, pistol, and SMG all at once. As for why that's somehow incredibly useful, I'll get into that later, as it's quite build-dependent. Unfortunately, it'll take you at least around 20 hours before you can get the Bod as it's in the final region you'll unlock. So, here's where you need to go to unlock this legendary shotgun. How to get the Bod in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Bod from the Axemaul boss at the end of the Toil of Spoiling Vis mine, in the centre of Dominion's Carcadia District , near The Lockaway safehouse . If you're wondering where this is, it's the Timekeeper's city at the centre of the map, which you'll unlock after completing all three outer regions' stories: Fadefields, Terminus Range, and Carcadia Burn.

Which is why Forza Horizon 6 is headed to the land of the rising sun. In a chat with GamesRadar , the arcade racing sim's art director Don Arceta said that the series' Japanese venture would be \"our biggest map yet.\" But fear not, because it's \"also our most full.\" Just what you'd expect a dev on an upcoming release to say, I suppose, but I've got no reason to doubt Arceta. Playground hasn't run into much trouble creating bigger and more things-crammed worlds over the past couple of Horizon games, and it sounds like the studio didn't run into any trouble finding stuff to do in Japan, either. \"Obviously, we can't go bigger without filling it with things to do and see,\" said Arceta. \"And I think this map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense.

During her boss encounter, she'd flit about the stage barking classic lines like \"Shaw!\" and \"Haa!\" and \"Adino!\" and \"Hegale!\" But in Silksong, where she's the protagonist, she's a rather taciturn sort. Which is a crime. But that crime has now been rectified: a modder named Nai has created HK Hornet Voice Restored (via GamesRadar ), happily restoring our heroine's barks. Now, your many attacks will be accompanied by all the hegales and adinos you could dream of. Which is, ah, maybe a bit annoying, actually? This might get me blacklisted for life, but if there's one thing I've taken from HK Hornet Voice Restored, it's that actually Team Cherry might have had a reason for yoinking her voice away when players are in control of her.

Right now the Konami stans are eating good, and the company seems determined to maintain its momentum. This week's Tokyo Game Show saw another \"Metal Gear—Production Hotline\" livestream, during which Metal Gear Solid: The Master Collection Vol. 2 was announced but not detailed (MGS4 or we riot), and we got a new look at Fox Hunt, a free multiplayer mode being added to Delta on October 30. Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit. Matches can feature up to twelve players and there are two modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude. Survival Capture is a multi-phase mode where, and I'm just going to quote Konami here, \"victory hinges on capturing the elusiv…",

It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools . In a recent correspondence with the Portal development team, PC Gamer's Morgan Park asked whether we could go so far as to delete all of the buildings in a map to transform it into a flat wasteland.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

    "body": "An AMD patent application for a new spin on DDR5 PC memory has been spotted. The so-called high-bandwidth dual inline memory module or HB-DIMM is designed to boost memory bandwidth courtesy of pseudo channels, buffer chips and intelligent signal routing. It looks very fancy, but we'll take some convincing it'll appear in PCs any time soon. Uncovered by Tech4Gamers , the AMD patent application explains that modern computing platforms have ever greater memory bandwidth requirements. \"Because the memory bandwidth required for applications such as high-performance graphics processors and servers, which have multiple cores and a corresponding increase in bandwidth-per-core requirement, are outpacing the roadmap of bandwidth improvements for DDR DRAM chips, improved DIMM architectures are needed to meet such requirements with current DDR chip technologies such as DDR5,\" the filing says. The answer to that problem? \"The high-bandwidth DIMM (HB-DIMM). This approach seeks to use the benefits of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) format in a DIMM form-factor.\" Each HB-DIMM is primarily composed of memory chips and buffer chips. \"The data buffer chips are coupled to respective sets of the memor…",

    "body": "I first got my hands on the Glorious Model O3 Wireless sitting on the floor in the halls of Gamescom as a slapdash 15-minute product demo. I was a little frustrated that I only got a few minutes with it because it's not often you have a product that tries to genuinely innovate in a way that might actually make sense. That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful. And now, after spending some more time with it and actually using it for gaming, I'm happy to say it's done so pretty successfully. The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",
