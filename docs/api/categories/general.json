    "body": "There are 64 Horus Heresy books, give or take, depending whether you count the novellas or the graphic novel or the Primarch spin-offs. The point is, there are too many for any normal person to commit to reading. Fortunately, you don't have to. That number includes a lot of extremely skippable short story anthologies, and multiple novels so tangential you won't miss anything if you don't read them. If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change. If you'd like to spend years of your life reading books where that hope is snuffed out like a candle by a galaxy of darkness, that's …",

Unlike the other event plants, you'll have a few extra steps to follow before you can pluck these strange flowers and throw them into the cauldron. It's one of five resources added exclusively for Halloween, and seems to be the most common ingredient among the new recipes. Since I've been farming candy like mad to trade for the Witch class , I'm painfully familiar with how to get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest and here to provide a guided tour through the forest. How get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest Before you can pick Stareweed, you'll need to grow it, so collect 10 flowers and find the Fairy's house on your map. She sells one pack of Stareweed Seeds (and other Halloween plants) for 10 flowers a bag—bring 50 if you want to save yourself a trip buying the other seeds.

So when a Call of Duty film adaptation was announced last month, I figured there was a chance we might not hear about it for a while—or maybe not ever again. Wrong. Activision and Paramount just announced that Taylor Sheridan, co-creator of your dad's favorite TV show and its roughly 36 different spinoffs, Yellowstone, is writing the script for the Call of Duty movie. Co-writing and directing is Peter Berg, developer of Friday Night Lights. Sheridan is a huge get—NBCUniversal reportedly spent in the neighborhood of $1 billion to woo him away from Paramount starting in 2029—and as a result Call of Duty is suddenly looking like a huge movie. No stars have been announced yet, but I'd bet money Mark Wahlberg is blowing up Sheridan's phone right about now. At least we can assume Frank Grillo and Jon Bernthal will b…",

But as Lincoln explained in September, the ability also enables some new, off-label behavior: By grabbing the floor, you can shake your physics-enabled moneymaker at nearby enemies with enough enthusiasm to, in the words of developer Semiwork, \"twerk them to death.\" So that's pretty cool, if you're into that sort of thing.
