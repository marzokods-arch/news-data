That's happened to some owners of ASRock motherboards, but it's also apparently occurring with Asus models, and the company has launched an investigation into it all. In the case of the whole ASRock thing, the company was arguably a bit dismissive of the whole problem to begin with , before admitting that the BIOS on certain motherboards was allowing too much current to be drawn by the CPU in specific scenarios. A little while afterwards, AMD itself stated that \"this issue arises because some ODM (original design manufacturer) BIOSes do not adhere to AMD's recommended values .\" However, Ryzen chip failures haven't been exclusive to ASRock motherboards, and there have been reports of issues with models from all the key manufacturers: Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte.

We now have a client roadmap that combines best-in-class performance with cost-optimized solutions giving me confidence that we are on the path of 45% market share and profitability in both notebooks and desktops over the next several years,\" Tan said (transcript via SeekingAlpha ) Nova Lake could be a big improvement over Arrow lake.

In an interview published by Xbox, Fable game director Ralph Fulton discussed how the studio dealt with taking on a storied series from a once-venerated studio. \"One of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be a Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.\" Fulton went on: \"And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right?

Pump the brakes a bit, though: over on Reddit, the new necromancy system wasn't well-received, and many Hytale players took the update as a sign that Hytale's magic and mana system, which is not in the game yet, may be cause for concern. The backlash was loud enough that Hypixel CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme hopped onto Twitter to calm everyone down. \"Just want to add a note, the grimoire is NOT the magic system at all,\" Collins-Laflamme posted . \"Seeing reddit go full panic mode thinking this is what we have in mind for magic is kinda insane, this is just a random drop fun item, it will evolve over time,\" he said.

In DreadBound's first trailer, I clocked instantly deploying spike traps, oil slicks to trip enemies (or set them on fire), Ravenholm-style circular saw projectiles that you can embed in walls and use as platforms to reach high places, and an homage to my favorite quick melee in all of gaming, the Dark Messiah kick. Rather than the handcrafted levels typical of immersive sims, DreadBound will feature \"a cursed city that changes every time you die.\" That gave this Roguelikephobic gamer some pause, but roguelike and immsim, when attempted in the past, have often proven to be a chocolate and peanut butter genre combo.

It's a bit of a drive-by in which Turbodriver only briefly touches on topics like being compensated for modding, access to adult content online, and whether he finds his mods controversial. The details about himself he's willing to share (his identity not among them), mostly boil down to not seeing himself as an educator or an activist.

And it's setting the bar high. \"Although our game is a new beginning,\" said game director Ralph Fulton, \"I think what we're making is really faithful to the spirit of the classic Lionhead trilogy that we all love.\" The core of the new Fable is freedom, choices, and consequences: Setting off in the wake of disaster as Albion's first hero in a generation, you'll explore a seamless open world, visiting new and familiar locations alike including Bowerstone, \"a huge city full of contrasts: rich and poor, nobles and commoners, royalty and criminals.\" Your character will be fully customizable in both appearance and abilities, with access to melee and ranged combat options as well as powerful magic spells. There's also plenty of \"normal, everyday stuff\" to do in Albion: Jobs, romance, home ownership, becoming a landlord and making life miserable for your tenants, which of course will be reflected in their opinions…",

Beast of Reincarnation was first unveiled last June, and its unique visual identity really speaks to me. The beautiful Japanese countryside, mystical elements, and samurai protagonist (complete with wide-brimmed kasa ) remind me of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei, but the postapocalyptic world is also suffused with overgrown, rusted megastructures and gangly automatons that call to mind Square Enix's beloved Nier series. And let me be clear: Nier is beloved to me . The NieR connection isn't just visual: Beast of Reincarnation is similarly set thousands of years into Earth's future, where humanity is struggling against a plague of evil magical plants, as well as a distinctly Yoko Taro-flavored race of transhumanist robots gone wrong. \"The Golems are beings created when former humans transferred their souls into mechanical b…",

But then there's a whole class of the more futuristic stuff, like the energy weapons.\" One of Pely's first designs was the power armour, which turns its wearers into hulking mini-mechs, and this would also feed into how Pely thought about the weapons. \"The assault rifle from Fallout 4 originally didn't start out as an assault rifle, it was meant to be a gun that was scaled and suitable for a guy in massive power armor,\" says Pely. \"In…",

The idea behind it is that everything is player-led. You can set up a market stall full of goods you've made yourself, from armour to flowers, and trade with other players. There's also dungeon diving, where you'll rummage up the gold you need to buy wares from community merchants, and you can join clans and form villages and even castles if you've got enough people playing with you. Despite my preference for solo experiences, the emphasized focus on community building is so far off what I usually go for that it's swung around to interesting for me, and the fact the game is free to play until Monday, January 26 means I'm tempted to dip into it this weekend and see if I gel with it.

There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing.

It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living.

But indie developer Inkle's co-founder Jon Ingold has given me hope. 14 years after the studio's first game Frankenstein hit iOS devices, its latest offering, the WW2-era puzzle game TR-49 , is the team's best launch ever. No, literally. \"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years,\" Ingold writes on Bluesky . \"I admit I'm surprised! Made in nine months, mostly as an experiment to learn Godot, and an excuse to play with some actors. (And for me to do some acting.)\" TR-49 is a puzzle game where you have to feed books to an old computer to discover a world-changing secret. Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so. It reminds me of the recent success of Peak, the co-op climber Aggro Crab rustled up in a frantic four-week game jam , refining it in a few short months afterwards alongside Landfall.

Eventually, towards the tail end of 2025, the situation resolved, and you could pick up all kinds of GPUs for considerably less than their MSRPs. Now, thanks to the global memory supply crisis, graphics cards sporting 16 GB or more of VRAM are all shooting back up in price. In November of last year, you could bag yourself a 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 Ti , or RTX 5080 for $400, $745, or $990, respectively. Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268. That might not seem particularly bad, especially in light of just how expensive they were at launch, but those prices are the very best around. For example, B&H's cheapest 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti is $630 , and should you want an RTX 5070 Ti from Best Buy , you'll need to hand over $1,199. This isn't to say that graphics cards with less than 16 GB of VRAM haven't been unaffected, as they have all increased in price, too. It's…",

But let's not get ahead of ourselves: Update 2 is currently available in pre-release testing (enable this via the launcher's settings menu), and if all goes well, it should be in everyone's hands come Friday or Saturday, suggests Collins-Laflamme. The standout feature of Update is no doubt its improved mining experience. Pickaxes have been reworked to make higher-quality picks mine faster (frankly, I was baffled that wasn't how they worked initially). Building on that, while WorldGen V2 still isn't here, Hypixel has changed how ores are spawned. Namely, major ores are better distributed between the tiered zones, and there's much more ore overall, especially in the Devastated Lands. I still think Lucky Mining is one of the best Hytale mods , but these changes go a long way in making mining and gear progression feel more rewarding. Another major…",

The best Arknights: Endfield characters are strong either because they're great at a very specific role, such as how Xaihi is the meta Cryo support character, or they're super versatile, like how Ardelia and Akekuri will work in basically any team comp. Still, there are team combos for each art which are very strong when put together. Some of these are more free-to-play friendly than others, with Electric and Physical/Cryo making for great free teams, while mono-Physical squads are currently among the most costly if you want them to perform at peak.

Players have been used to comprehensive and game-warpingly powerful combat addons for over 20 years at this point, so of course it's kicking up a fuss. Game director Ion Hazzikostas, who talked to PCG contributor Heather Newman recently , has spent a lot of his time dutifully reassuring players, reiterating intentions, and trying to disarm panic. Now the conversation's shifted in another direction: Has Blizzard gone soft on addons, by walking back some of the changes and specifics? No, says Hazzikostas, that was always the plan. As a matter of fact, when Midnight went into alpha testing, the strategy was to first go scorched-earth and see how much broke. \"I was surprised, and I learned a lot about exactly how many of our add-ons are written in the first few weeks of alpha … We realized pretty quickly that a ton of these add-ons were written …",

Turns out they vary from absolutely awful to still-kinda-potatovision-but-better-than-you'd-probably-guess, if that's not an unforgivably excessive use hyphenation and compound adjectives. Anywho, to go lower than 720p, for starters you actually have to edit Red Dead Redemption 2's config file. 2kliksphilip first tried 120p base resolution, then 90p. At this point, text and menu controls get very hard to read even given those elements are rendered at the upscaled resolution, which is double the vertical pixel count but still very low.
