    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is working on adding a new incognito search mode to its Android app. The feature will work by turning off the history for your current search. This is the equivalent of Google’s incognito mode on its iOS app. There are many ways to perform an incognito search on your Android phone, but Google is working on adding another one that is both more intuitive and easier to remember. The option might have the less obvious name of “History Off Search” instead of a simpler “Incognito” and will appear straight in the main Google app. This will finally allow the Google app on Android to catch up to the iOS app, which has had an incognito mode for many years.

The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard.

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",
