    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority I’m too lazy to be a Strava user, but I’m fully aware that it’s an immensely popular app that falls somewhere between a training log and a social media platform. I’m also familiar with the business model it employs to encourage members to pay for the premium version, which is probably easier to justify mentally if it’s seen as benefiting your health — I do the same rationalizing with my Duolingo subscription . We were keen to find out whether you pay for Strava, so we ran a poll among our readers. I was quite surprised by the percentage of you who actually do. That poll was prompted by an opinion piece from my colleague Ryan Haines, who explained why Strava went from his favorite running app to something he now barely tolerates. After years as a paying subscriber, he argued that Strava has become far too aggressive about locking away personal data and other features unless you cough up for Premium. For him, the fun and freedom that originally made Strava appealing have eroded to the point that he’s now treating it less like a training tool and more like a glorified kudos machine.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro Max is rumored to feature a bigger battery than the current generation. The international variant of the iPhone 18 Pro could feature a battery capacity ranging between 5,100 and 5,200mAh. This will be higher than the battery capacity expected of the Galaxy S26 Ultra. With the launch of the iPhone 17 Pro last year, Apple flipped the narrative around minimal upgrades to its flagship phones. Even though the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were only slightly refashioned, the changes were enough to make it the highest-selling phone series of the past quarter. One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra. Famed leaker Digital Chat Station recently suggested that the next-generation top-tier iPhone could have its battery capacity bumped up over the current generation.

There was also a “View more” button, which we presumed would house the rest of your passes.

As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority There are plenty of reasons to buy flagship Android phones , such as bleeding-edge performance, wireless charging support, and premium designs. The list goes on, with high-end phones also offering super-fast charging, sharp and bright displays, IP68/69 ratings, and great build quality. Needless to say, you’re often getting a lot of features and perks by paying a premium. However, colleague Andrew Grush recently questioned whether flagship phones are still worth it . I reckon they’re not worth it for most people, but there’s one reason why I still buy and use high-end Android phones over most mid-range devices. I simply want a fantastic camera experience.",

Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 .

SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",
