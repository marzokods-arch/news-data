The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Over the past couple of weeks, Google and Disney have been at loggerheads due to a pricing dispute. What started with both parties’ failure to meet each other halfway in negotiations, resulting in more than 20 Disney channels, including ABC and ESPN, being removed from YouTube TV , has spread to other streaming platforms and blocked access to Disney’s paid content across other Google-owned platforms . The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions.

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The latest update to the Citron emulator now offers Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. This means your Snapdragon 8 Elite phone should see better performance and fewer bugs with the Switch emulator. This update also brings support for Windows on Arm devices as well as a variety of other optimizations and fixes. Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

    "body": "TL;DR Ever spotted an emulator for Android with an unusual reference in its package name? There’s a good reason why. Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Samsung has confirmed that it’s developing Android XR glasses in collaboration with Google, Warby Parker, and Gentle Monster. The Galaxy Ring already supports a double-pinch gesture for phone control, and an earlier patent suggests that broader cross-device controls could be on the way. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring hasn’t had the best press lately , but it isn’t going anywhere, and its functionality may soon expand beyond interacting with just your phone. A clue we spotted in a recent app update hints that the wearable could one day help control Samsung’s upcoming Android XR glasses.

This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US.

And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana.

Last week’s reports revealed that Apple will pay Google around $1 billion a year for a custom-built Gemini AI model to power the next version of Siri, expected to debut with iOS 26.4 next spring. It’s a huge deal between two rivals, but according to a new report, Apple isn’t planning to draw attention to who’s behind the technology. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers. Gurman adds that Apple prefers to present it as part of its own system, even though much of the core model isn’t.",
