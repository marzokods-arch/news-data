The suit may not lead to legal consequences for those individuals, who are believed to be living in China, but could still weaken Lighthouse. Google is suing dozens of people it asserts are involved in a large-scale phishing operation. Yesterday, Google filed a civil suit in New York aimed at dismantling an organization called Lighthouse, a “phishing-as-a-service” operation that Google says has been used to scam more than a million people all over the world. In a blog post, Google details the Lighthouse operation: The kit generates text message-based phishing (or “smishing”) attacks that leverage existing brands in order to extract information from victims. If you’ve ever received a sketchy text that purports to be from a package delivery service, directing you to click a link to verify personal or payment info, it may have come out of Lighthouse.

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2.

ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

    "body": "Voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri are nothing new, but I wouldn’t blame anyone for giving up on them. Siri’s frustrations have been well-documented, and Google spent the past two years stripping Assistant of features in preparation for Gemini’s widespread rollout. Gemini is officially Google’s voice assistant of the future, making its way to Android, Wear OS, and Nest hardware as the default in 2025. Now, users simply need to trust it. For many, that trust will be difficult for Gemini to earn. I became disenfranchised with Google Assistant over the past few years, like many others, due to its lost features and general unreliability . That said, I decided to give Gemini a fair shake on Wear OS with my Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 , and now I can’t imagine using my smartwatch without it. Having Gemini on my wrist saves me time every day with these five tasks, and here they are.",

They’re portable smart monitors designed to move around your home for streaming, work, and light interaction. With prices up to $1,199, they’ll appeal mostly to users who value flexibility over traditional desk-bound setups. Samsung is expanding its screen lineup into a new category that may be unlike any you’ve seen before. The Movingstyle series is meant for users who don’t want to be tethered to one spot, whether streaming, working from different rooms, gaming, or mirroring their phone to a big display. According to Samsung , the aim is to support “connected, fast-paced lifestyles” by making displays portable, flexible, and smarter. The star of the show is the Movingstyle touchscreen, a 27-inch QHD panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and, unusually for something this large, touch support. It has a built-in battery that lasts up to three hours, letting you use it untethered from the couch, desk, or outlet. The screen props up via an integrated kickstand, or you can slot it onto a rollable floor stand with hidden wheels and roll it from the bedroom to the balc…",

Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh).

Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

    "summary": "Emulator developers have turned this Android controversy into a performance hack.",
    "body": "TL;DR Ever spotted an emulator for Android with an unusual reference in its package name? There’s a good reason why. Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
