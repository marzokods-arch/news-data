    "body": "I’ve used a lot of Nexus and Pixels in the past, but from 2019 until present, I’ve been a Samsung guy, owning the S10 Plus and every Ultra model from the S20 to the S24 series. A few months ago, I started thinking about switching to a Pixel for the first time since the Pixel 3 XL. After the Pixel 10 launched, I pulled the trigger and bought a 10 Pro . After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place. Toggling all of the alarms in a group with the press of a single button saves time and is so much easier than having to scroll through a list of alarms to find the right ones.",

Thankfully, we’ve all been reaching the end of most days without desperately dashing for a charger . However, some models are definitely better than others, and the phones certainly haven’t closed the gap on rivals that offer longer screen-on-time. Surprisingly, despite its larger battery, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has fared worse in our testing than the two smaller handsets. Anecdotally, we’ve struggled to reach much beyond four hours of screen-on time with the XL, while the regular Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro manage closer to five hours — or even a little more with lighter use. That’s a pretty significant discrepancy, and one we certainly didn’t expect.",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

Over the years, it has also positioned its brand as reliable, trustworthy, and to a point, even premium, convincing people to part with their money. However, no company is perfect. Samsung phones are generally among the most expensive on the market, their flagship series falls behind some of its competitors when it comes to features like fast charging, and pushing out the latest software updates often takes more time than we’d like.

The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online?

Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected.

The Galaxy Buds 4 carry the model number SM-R540, while the model number for the Buds 4 Pro is SM-R640. For comparison, the model numbers for Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are SM-R530 and SM-R630, respectively. It’s been over a year since Samsung launched the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. As such, you may be wondering what exactly is going on with Samsung’s next premium wireless earbuds . Rumors have been pointing to a release in early 2026, possibly launching during the first Galaxy Unpacked of the year. Outside of a few other details, there isn’t a whole lot of information to parse through yet. However, we are learning something new today about the next-generation earbuds — the model numbers. Although stable One UI 8 is just starting to arrive on Galaxy devices, Samsung is already working on One UI 8.5. That update appears to have leaked , as some people are digging into an alleged modified build. In a tip sent to Android Authority , the code within that build seems to provide the very first reference to the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro .",

Google TV hasn’t been having the best luck in the crowded smart TV market recently. With relatively low adoption in the US and advertisers favoring YouTube instead, Google seems to be rethinking parts of the TV platform, starting with a potential refresh of the home screen design. As spotted by 9to5Google , the update is showing up through an apparent server-side change on top of Google TV Home version 1.0.806977084. Navigation is split into two pill-shaped clusters that sit above the content feed. One holds “Home,” “Live,” and “Apps” alongside a search shortcut, while the other contains quick-access buttons for settings and the screensaver. A built-in tooltip even explains the switch, noting that “For You” has been renamed “Home” and that search now lives in this section.",

The core can support ray-tracing, but Google seems to have left this unimplemented. The peak GPU clock is reported at 1.1GHz; however, corners of the web suggest that the core is significantly downclocked to just 400MHz .

I spent several months throughout the year dipping back into the most premium Pixel whenever I got the chance between testing other phones, and I felt like it just kept improving with each passing update. Eventually, though, I started looking to the future. I wondered how Google could follow its best launch ever and worried it might push too far and lose the magic. And then I got the Pixel 10 Pro XL in my hands, and my fears (mostly) melted away. Here’s how this maxed-out flagship earned a place in my small-phone-loving heart.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s Phone app has historically forced a portrait orientation while making calls. Users have recently noticed that this no longer holds true, and some devices set to auto-rotate will turn even in calls. We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones. We discovered evidence for the new setting in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, but the setting isn’t live yet. For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation.
