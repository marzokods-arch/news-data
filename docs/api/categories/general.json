The couple got married on Saturday (Sept. 27) in California, with Gomez confirming the happy news with a same-day look at some romantic wedding photos and video clips. The pop star and Only Murders in the Building actress posted a sweet wedding album on Instagram Saturday evening, crediting photographer/artist Petra Collins by tagging her on the images. (Petra also tagged her sister Anna Collins in an Instagram Story sharing footage from the wedding.) The pictures focus on the bride and groom embracing, and they share a glimpse at wedding-day details &#8212; like Gomez&#8217;s custom halter-style dress by Ralph Lauren , her bridal bouquet, and the celebration&#8217;s private estate setting. A short video captures an intimate moment in which Gomez fixes Blanco&#8217;s bowtie and puts her hands on his face, just before the lovebirds share a sweet kiss. Gomez wrote a simple, classy caption to commemorate their wedding day: &#8220;9.27.25.&#8221; She surrounded the date with white heart emojis. &#8220;my wife in real life,&#8221; Blanco commented on her post.

Midway through 2023 single “Conceited,” Young paused to communicate with her keyboardist. The message did not appear to get across before she suddenly collapsed.

The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands. The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the “mane of a lion.” Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs “Nutbush City Limits,” “Proud Mary,” “Private Dancer,” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” from the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.”…",
