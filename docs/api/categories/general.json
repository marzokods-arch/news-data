Keighley, host of The Game Awards, posted a message on X urging his followers to \"Check out #TheGameAwards nominee page on Steam to celebrate the best of the year.\" He attached an image of the Steam front page, which—because he was logged in at the time—revealed that he has precisely one game in his wishlist.

Now, it's hired the former narrative lead of Cloud Chamber Games, the developer that's currently working on BioShock 4 . Liz Albl joined CD Projekt last month in the role of senior writer on Cyberpunk 2 . Prior to this, she spent almost three years as narrative lead at Cloud Chamber Games working on BioShock 4, with her other credits including Ghost of Tsushima , Watch Dogs: Legion , and just over a year working on Monolith's cancelled Wonder Woman game . As spotted by IGN , Albl left Cloud Chamber in August—around the time the developer laid off staff after BioShock 4 failed an internal review , with its narrative criticised by 2K's executives in particular as the publisher committed to a development overhaul. BioShock 4 had already been in development for a decade before the review, with 2K announcing it was in production six years ago.

They're also available to customise as part of the Xbox Design Lab suite, so you can... I don't know, make them look like SpongeBob has a terrible illness?

That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side. Despite its poor technical performance, however, I absolutely loved my monster-slaying holiday, giving it 89% in my Dragon's Dogma 2 review .

For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts. That's because it's simply an open-platform circuit board that you can connect a motherboard to, and separately control fans, pumps, and lights; it also provides external storage options so you don't have to use those on the motherboard. It might be a bit 'inside baseball' but let me explain why this is so useful for hardware testing.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together.

Epic Games has announced plans to team up with probably its greatest rival in game development, Unity, to bring games made using the Unity engine to Fortnite. Epic also says, \"Unity’s enhanced commerce platform\" will come to Unreal Engine. What's more, the collaboration will see Unity bring Unreal Engine support to its platform. To quote the killer excerpt from Epic's announcement: \"Developers will have the ability to publish Unity games into Fortnite, one of the world’s largest gaming ecosystems with more than 500 million registered accounts worldwide, and participate in the Fortnite Creator Economy. Also announced today at Unite, Unity’s Annual Developer Conference, Unity will be bringing Unreal Engine support to their cross-platform commerce platform.\" If you're wondering what led these former mortal enemies to get together in such a sweeping collab', over to Tim Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Epic Games. “Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” he said.

But if you're buying your very first GPU, then it can feel like an absolute minefield. Never fear, though, as I'm here to try and take the edge off some of those worries. And you shouldn't let any such concerns put you off, either, because the best graphics card upgrade will be the single most impactful change you can make to your existing gaming PC. It's not hard either. As an upgrade, it will likely be just a simple case of taking one big lump of graphics card out and sticking another big lump in, though there are some things you can do to make it easier for yourself, which I'll cover down the page. But once you have a shiny new GPU in your PC, it will feel like a whole new rig the next time you boot a new game. In fact, you'll probably want to go back and play all those games where you struggled to get 60 fps out of your old card, all over again. The big end-of-year sales are almost here, and we'll be picking out the best Black Friday graphics card deals if you need a little more help choosing the right GPU for you.

Hypixel's co-founder at the time wrote: \"Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be.\" What looked like the executioner's axe for ol' Hytale, though, might well have been its salvation. Riot sold the game's rights back to Simon Collins-Laflamme , the studio's original co-founder, passing the torch from Noxy back to Laflamme to go \"back to the original vision for Hytale.\" You might think that \"original vision\" would take some considerable time to cobble together, but it turns out, er, no.

It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice.
