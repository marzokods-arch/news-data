In one corner was Chappell Roan, the singular superstar who had been dazzling huge festival crowds for months; in the other was Sabrina Carpenter, the former Disney Channel personality with multiple ubiquitous radio smashes. Both pop dynamos had been nominated in all of the Big&nbsp;Four general categories, and for best new artist, they were surrounded by potential spoilers, including Shaboozey, whose “A&nbsp;Bar Song (Tipsy)” had logged the most weeks atop the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100 in 2024; Teddy Swims, whose “Lose Control” eventually broke the Hot&nbsp;100 longevity record; and other new-school stars like Benson Boone, Doechii and RAYE. Ultimately, Roan emerged victorious — and delivered an instantly memorable acceptance speech that advocated for artists’ wages and health care. Eight months later, a fresh class of best new artist hopefuls is eager for such a moment at the 68th annual Grammys — but in a race that looks nothing like the previous one. Whereas the 2025 best new artist competition was unusually stacked, the 2026 trophy appears fully up for grabs, with very few sure-thing nominees …",

Born in Minneapolis and raised in Gainesville, Fla. — his late brother Tom played with fellow Gainesvillian Tom Petty — Leadon grew up steeped in bluegrass and acoustic traditions. His early work with Dillard &amp; Clark and on the Burrito Brothers&#8217; second and third albums fused traditional instrumentation with progressive songwriting, laying the foundation for what would later be dubbed Americana. In 1971, he co-founded the Eagles with Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner, helping craft the band&#8217;s signature sound meshing country and rock. His contributions — on guitar, banjo, pedal steel and mandolin — defined early Eagles albums such as the band&#8217;s self-titled debut, Desperado and One of These Nights .

Dean was thinking about her stage show: she had spent a good chunk of 2024 on the road in the U.K. and Europe and had more tour dates booked for this spring and summer. She had been presenting the sumptuous songs from her 2023 debut Messy for growing audiences but knew that her live show could use more tempo. “We started with the 6/8 groove,” Dean recalls today of the studio session. “I had a crush at the time. I was like, ‘Listen: talk to me !’ That initial joy when you first fancy somebody — I just wanted to channel that essence into a song.” Related 2025’s Chartbreakers: Alex Warren, The Marías and More Each&nbsp;Month Olivia Dean&#8217;s &#8216;The Art of Loving&#8217;: All 12 Tracks&nbsp;Ranked Olivia Dean Announces Largest Headline Gigs Yet for 2026: Here Are Her U.K. &amp; Europe Arena Tour&nbsp;Dates The result, “Man I Need,” has quickened the pace of Dean’s caree…",

The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels.

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well. That said, there are plenty of great alternatives to AT&amp;T if you are willing to give prepaid a chance.",

The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation.

We’ve already spotted nearly a dozen new features in One UI 8.5 and are learning about a quite useful addition.

Alongside the newest Kindle Scribe lineup launched at its fall hardware event, Amazon announced two new reading tools: Story So Far and Ask This Book.

Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience.

Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night.

If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place.

And my favorite thing there might have been a dinky little $20 light switch. To be fair, this is more than just a simple switch, and the $19.99 Amazon Basics Smart Dimmer Switch and Remote for Music and Routines does a whole lot more, as its mouthful of a name should hopefully convey.

As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it.

    "body": "The Samsung Galaxy Ring is in the news right now, and not for a good reason. Yesterday, tech YouTuber Daniel (aka ZONEofTECH) posted photos on X showing his Galaxy Ring with a swollen battery . He noted that the battery swelled to the point where the Galaxy Ring was (painfully) stuck on his finger, and as a result, he was denied boarding on an upcoming flight. Attempts to remove the ring with soap and water apparently only made things worse, and Daniel eventually required an emergency hospital visit before the Galaxy Ring could be removed.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is offering a free phone cleaning kit to its customers today as part of T-Mobile Tuesdays. The freebie can be claimed in the T-Life app and redeemed at corporate T-Mobile stores. Other deals this week include discounted Pizza Hut melts, free photo prints, and Shell fuel rewards. T-Mobile Tuesdays is T-Mobile’s wildly popular loyalty program. While it’s not a compelling reason by itself to switch to the carrier, the occasional freebies pair very well with T-Mobile’s deals and plans . We’ve seen the company offer crazy $0.01 chicken tenders , free Slurpees , and water bottles that unintentionally warp under the sun . T-Mobile Tuesdays is back this week with a new freebie, and this one will come in very handy in keeping your phone clean. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
