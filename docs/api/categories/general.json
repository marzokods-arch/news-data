But there’s also a lot of tech that’s not quite ready for prime time, and isn’t being publicly exhibited. I visited the BOOX booth today hoping to take another look at its great e-readers like the Palma 2 , but ended up getting a surprise early preview of the next generation of Palma, with a couple major upgrades in tow. Electronic paper displays have been nothing short of a revolution, and their ultra-low power demands, image retention capabilities, and exceptionally eye-friendly output have formed the foundation of the e-reader industry. We’ve come a long way from the early days of the Kindle, and companies like BOOX have continuously pushed the tech to new places with things like stylus input, color screens, and useful new form factors.",

Sadly, phones with a removable battery are a dying breed, and our options are getting very, very limited in this niche market. Phones with removable batteries are very convenient in a few ways. For starters, it makes it easy to hot swap batteries on the go, so you can carry multiple and switch them if your phone dies mid-day. Also, batteries degrade over time, and today’s standard solution is to take them to a professional to replace them. With removable batteries, this process is as simple as ordering a new battery and sticking it into the phone yourself.",

Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

If you just grabbed a new Pixel 10 series phone and wanted to get a few accessories to complement it, UGREEN has launched its new MagFlow Qi2 25W lineup for faster magnetic charging. Every Pixel 10 model supports Qi2 charging, but there’s some nuance involved that you should be aware of. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold top out at 15W with Qi2-certified chargers when paired with a 20W or higher USB-C adapter. On the other hand, the Pixel 10 Pro XL steps things up with Qi2.2 support, hitting 25W when used with a Qi2.2-certified ch…",

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025. Most e-readers stick to the basics: an E-Ink screen, a bookstore tie-in, and enough battery to survive a long vacation. At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an “AI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.” This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed. On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn’t shared an actual usage estimate.",
