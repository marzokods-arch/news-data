    "body": "Splatterhouse was a sidescrolling beat 'em up series that first appeared in Japanese arcades in 1988. It and subsequent Splatterhouse games were novel for their gory horror approach to a genre we more readily associate with street fighting or Ninja Turtles . The series is mostly forgotten to all except a small diehard community, but it turns out Namco had bigger and more ambitious plans for it that never officially materialised. Namco did release one Splatterhouse spin-off in the form of 1989's platformer Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti, a watered down and \"cutesy\" take on the more mature (but still quite tongue-in-cheek) beat 'em up outings. It can nowadays be played via the Namco Museum Archives . But there was another unreleased Famicom Splatterhouse game. That was proven in October when a fully playable ROM of something called Splatterhouse: World was dumped on 4chan. Taking the form of a ye olde 8-bit JRPG, it's a truly fascinating artefact, not least because there are very few horror-themed JRPGs from that era: Capcom's Sweet Home is the only other one that comes to mind. While the October dump was a huge moment, seemingly undeniable proof of Splatterhouse: World's existence…",

And yes, occasionally, as Booker DeWitt, I would eat an entire birthday cake out of a garbage can. So what? A man's gotta heal, and sometimes a man's only option is a trash can behind a desk in a police station where someone, for some reason, threw away an entire birthday cake. Speaking of cakes: that's what our quiz today is all about! I'll show you 10 cakes, and all you've gotta do is type in the name of the game each cake is from. Should be a piece of cake, right?

You might think such a resplendent back catalog would mean publishers are tripping over each other to offer Gilbert the chance to make whatever he likes, but not so; he had to cancel his last project, a Zelda-inspired open world RPG , in part because he couldn't get the resources he needed. In an interview with Ars Technica , Gilbert talked about why the project was scrapped: “I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that.\" Although, Gilbert once described it as \"the game I always wanted to play,\" as our initial news piece about the RPG states, that dream apparently wasn't worth a decade of grueling work. As he told Ars Technica, \"it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\" This is typically where a publisher would step in, and it sounds like Gilbert tried to secure funding, but he said in the interview …",

Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\". Nightreign is finally playable. The relic system has been divisive from the st…",

Publisher Santa Ragione said in November that Valve declined to carry Horses because it contained \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione disputed that characterization, but an appeal was rejected and the ban stands. The Epic Games Store followed with its own ban on December 1, one day before Horses was set to launch.

    "body": "The Ayaneo Next II , a Windows-based handheld gaming PC, has been officially revealed—and it's every bit as beefy as its announcement back in July suggested. The jewel in its hardware crown is the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, a decidedly power-hungry chip that is sated by a whopping 115 Wh battery. This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder. There's no details on pricing or a release date yet but what I can tell you now is that, yes, in theory you could still take this chunky gaming handheld on a plane (though, you would need to check ahead of time what restrictions on 100+ Wh batteries may be in place for your specific airline). However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg. Next, let's peel back the lovingly grilled layers of that AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 mobile pr…",

And while gaming mouse docks are often disregarded as a novelty or even a gimmick, it's hard to deny their practicality. I mean, plugging in ? In 2025? Why waste my energy on something so tedious? Thankfully, the MSI Versa Pro Wireless gaming mouse and Mouse Dock Pro are all about the path of least resistance. Since the world is now moving into some strange, AI-fuelled Edo period I'm betting the use of gaming mouse docks will start to see a resurgence, too. Alright, better prep yourself for further laziness productivity rants as we get into why the MSI Versa Pro Wireless and Mouse Dock Pro is quickly becoming my new favorite gaming accessory duo. Aside from the huge, lit-up logo and RGB-studded side panels there's a certain sleek simplicity to the Versa Pro and Mouse Dock Pro.

Its system requirements are so detailed that you'll probably be able to figure out the exact setting you'll be using the game, long before you get a chance to install it. You can check them out for yourself via Hypixel Studio's news post on the matter. Let's start with the good stuff to begin with, just as Hypixel does: listing the expected performance, graphics preset, and screen resolution for the minimum, recommended, and 'streamer' requirements. Specifically, it's 30 fps at 1080p Low for minimum, 60 fps at 1080p High for recommended, and \"stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at 1440p\".

However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that. Fortunately, the newest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, has unleashed what I can only describe as the best method of transport for a game like this: horses. That's right, if you're someone who grew up wanting to be a princess and asking for a pony every Christmas, then Disney Dreamlight Valley has finally answered your wishes. Within the Wishblossom Ranch DLC you'll be able to befriend numerous horses too, rather than just being lumped with one.

When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA.
