If true, this would be the first wireless charging speed upgrade for the lineup since the Galaxy S20 series. Samsung’s flagships have long been criticized for their slow charging speeds, but there’s a sliver of hope on the horizon with the Galaxy S26 series. We’ve spotted branding for Super Fast Charging 3.0 , which aligns well with rumors of 60W PPS charging destined for the Galaxy S26 Ultra . Samsung is also working on faster wireless charging, and we’ve now spotted more clues about it. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

According to reports from the Israeli media, IDF officers with ranks above Lieutenant Colonel are now banned from using Android phones. The IDF believes rival forces can install malware on Android devices to access troops’ locations or saved files. The never-ending Android vs iOS clash is taking a political turn with Israel now picking favorites. As the Gaza war wages for over two years, the Israeli administration is planning steps, it thinks, that might limit cybersecurity-related incidents. In this endeavor, Israel is planning to expand its restrictions on mobile phone use to senior officers beyond a certain rank, banning Android phones for official use.",

You can no longer buy collections, and you must download existing wallpapers before the app is removed. Users will receive automatic pro-rated refunds for active subscriptions, and the app code is promised to be open-sourced after shutdown. Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified . Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Marques has announced that Panels is shutting down. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended.
