Verizon notes that this update fixes an issue that resulted in a fuzzy display. This comes after some Pixel 10 series owners found that their screens would go fuzzy for a few minutes at a time. Some Pixel 10 series owners discovered a rather weird bug, as t heir screens would go “snowy” for several minutes at a time. This also affected one of our review units. Google previously confirmed that it was rolling out a fix , and now, a new update seems to further tackle this. 9to5Google spotted a new September 2025 update for Pixel 10 series phones, featuring version number BD3A.250721.001.E1. We can confirm getting this update on at least one of our Pixel 10 series phones. The update weighs ~31MB, and Google didn’t actually detail any tweaks in its changelog.",

I bring it along on road trips and plug it into my accommodation’s TV. This saves me from whipping out my laptop or logging into my accounts on a stranger’s TV, and also gives me far more control over the content I have access to.

Sometimes, it’s the simplest things in the world that end up causing our most unexpected headaches. Google’s Clock app is about as straightforward as they come: it tells the time, lets you set alarms, and can run a stopwatch or a timer. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a recent update addressed our lack of imagination there, as users found the time rendered in unexpected ways, impairing visibility. Thankfully, it looks like some fixes are already arriving.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is rolling out an updated Photo Picker with a much-needed search bar, making it easier to find specific photos and videos to share with apps. The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker. Fortunately, Google is now rolling out an update to the Photo Picker that introduces some much-needed quality-of-life improvements. Late last week, Google began pushing the August 2025 Google Play System Update . While the official changelo…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google appears to be backing down from its long-standing position against letting Pixel phones record voice calls. The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done.

Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number.

Screen sizes have gone up so much that almost 7 inches is now considered a standard phone size, while we call 6 inches mini. I fall in the former category: I used the iPhone 16 Pro Max, a massive brick of a phone, for the majority of the last year. And if my wrist had vocal cords, you could hear it scream — though not anymore, as it’s feeling much better with the Pixel 10 . The crying wrist",

Launched back in 2012, the app still has a strong following on Android, even though I remember it best as my preferred Windows file manager back in the day. You all intrigued me, so I installed it on my main phone and started using it as my primary file manager. But is it any good compared to the many alternatives available? It certainly has the nostalgia factor, but what about functionality? Let’s explore. What I love about Total Commander",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing new functionality as part of the Pixel Watch Unlock feature, which allows you to unlock your Pixel phone using the Watch. The upgrade could enable you to not only unlock your Pixel phone using a Pixel Watch but also launch a specific section of the app. The feature is intended to work with a set of specific “Authorized” apps that you will be able to manage from the phone’s Settings. The Watch Unlock feature offers a convenient approach to automatically unlocking a Google Pixel phone — and keeping it unlocked — when your Pixel Watch is nearby. When enabled, it allows you to unlock the phone by simply swiping up or tapping a notification on the lock screen. Now, Google is testing new ways to unlock the screen and launching specific actions within certain apps on the phone.

The iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the list, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Xiaomi Redmi 14C 4G also made appearances. Apple and Samsung tend to dominate the list of most popular smartphones each quarter. Now, Counterpoint Research has announced the top ten best-selling phones of Q2 2025, and it’s mostly business as usual. Counterpoint Research revealed that iPhone 16 series handsets were the top three most popular smartphones in Q2 2025 . The iPhone 16 was at the top, followed by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and then the iPhone 16 Pro. Curiously, the iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the top ten list. So we can perhaps see why the company changed tack and launched the iPhone Air last week.",
