As part of the show's marketing various grandees have been doing the interview rounds, including Todd Howard, who's now served up the merest sliver of information about how the show will tie in to future games in the series. But first, it's time to butter up executive producer Jonathan Nolan. Bethesda execs have previously spoken about how a Fallout adaptation could've come much sooner, except Howard didn't want the usual \"videogame directors\" to come in and make a hash of it . But Nolan, co-writer on the likes of Westworld, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight trilogy? \"It turned out he was a huge fan of Fallout,\" Howard told the BBC's Newsbeat , adding that the two have become \"very close friends\" working on the show. \"Everyone involved is on the same page with how they want to treat it with authenticity.\" That authenticity is what led to an early decision that the TV show would be \"canon\" within the Fallout universe.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Well, perhaps novelty's the wrong word. It's maybe even a little judgmental—but in fairness, we live in a gaming ecosystem absolutely flooded with sequels. Call of Duty has had, to date, 22 whole games. Some of them even share a title! Why is there a Modern Warfare 2 and a Modern Warfare II? Shut up, eat your gunslop.

Case in point, one unlucky shopper thought they were getting DDR5 RAM at a decent price, only to have sticks of DDR2 memory with shoddy printed labels mimicking DDR5 heatsinks turn up at their door. The shopper in question goes by the handle BravoNorris, and had scooped up the last four available XPG Caster 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL40 kits from Adata, each containing two sticks of 16 GB memory. All were sold as new and sealed from Amazon Spain. After selling one, and installing another, BravoNorris opened a third box only to find the sticker scam in their hand. That's when they reached out to VideoCardz with the story . This third box was plastic-wrapped like the other three, and had shipped from the same point of origin in Ireland. However, this box contained two old sticks of DDR2 memory with DDR5 heatsink stickers that could fool someone only checking the product through the packaging window. BravoNorris also found a small plate of metal inside the box, likely placed to account for the weight discrepancy. As such, what'…",

Good news to anyone in the former group: Arctic has just launched a new paste, and some suggest it's one of the best. Arctic's MX-7 is a non-conductive and highly viscous paste. A higher viscosity than MX-6 but not as viscous as MX-4. I'll stop saying viscous now. The company suggests it can lower CPU temperatures by as much as a couple of degrees versus MX-6 in its own testing, though we have a third-party test to take a look at in a moment. MX-7 is already available to purchase in a variety of sizes. I'd normally round prices, but since we're talking pennies between some of these sizes, here they are in full: 8 gram - $8.59 4 gram - $7.39 4 gram with cleaning wipes - $9.59 2 gram - $6.89 Why you'd buy anything other than 8 grams with these sorts of prices is beyond me. Grab some isopropyl and a big tube, and you're sorted for cleaning and reapplication for years to come. Arctic recommends a cross pattern for applying MX-7. Who am I to go against the company that makes the paste—nah, I'm still going to do a big line down the middle. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. Generally…",

But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders.

The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things. I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs.

It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point. The horses are people, if you hadn't noticed yet In Horses, you play a young man, Anselmo, who's sent to stay and work for two weeks on a farm. The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm.

Stellar Blade was Shift Up's debut release on Steam, which naturally exposed it to a much wider Western audience. Of course it was a different sort of exposure that put Stellar Blade over the top with a certain portion of gamers, but beneath all the silly T&A was a reasonably solid action game that put up more than three million copies sold across PC and PS5 as of July 2025.

Our verdict is already in: Weekend/AU Editor Jody MacGregor was worried that Season 2 couldn't live up to the first season, but wasn't disappointed. \"Fallout hasn't simplified itself for second-screen viewers—it's still a show you need to pay attention to keep up with, and more importantly it's a show worth paying attention to,\" he says in his Fallout Season 2 review . \"The first season was full of great bits where the stars were absent, when it bounced back to Norm or over to Wilzig and Thaddeus and all the rest,\" Jody says. \"Season 2 carries on some of those stories—Norm continues to be a highlight—and introduces new ones, like what Hank's actually up to in Vegas, which are as interesting as the activities of the core trio.\" Even the fan service is handled well: \"I imagine someone has a list of 'things that happen in Fallout games' with 'be addicted to chems' written on it near 'get a rocket-assisted super sledge',\" J…",

Board Channels (login required, via Videocardz ) claims that the last new RTX 3060s will filter through supply channels in December, after which availability of the GPU will end. We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024. But it takes a while for those dies to work their way through the system. \"This Nvidia RTX 3060 series has been sold for a long time. Although Nvidia stopped producing this GPU a while ago, board partners still had remaining inventory on hand,\" Board Channels says. \"Brands such as Colorful, Taiwanese vendors, and Galax mostly cleared their inventory around September or October. After that, only Zotac still had the largest RTX 3060 stock on hand, and it was fully cleared during November. That means genuinely new RTX 3060 cards have now been completely sold through, and from this month the card is said to be officially exiting the marke…",

Don't get your hopes up about a release date, though—Larian isn't throwing any days, months, or even years out yet. But if you were worried that cinematic teaser meant Divinity was just starting pre-production, we've got some good news.

It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout.
