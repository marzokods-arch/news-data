The change appears to have been reverted, although it is unclear whether it was a bug or an intentional change in the first place. Update: December 18, 2025 (4:33 AM ET): It appears that Google has reconsidered this change and reverted it, allowing you to easily uninstall updates again. As Android Authority contributor AssembleDebug pointed out on X , once you update a pre-installed system app, the “Uninstall” button appears next to the “Open” button following the install, as it did previously.",

This includes both big changes that the majority of users expect from desktop OSes as well as smaller tweaks that only a fraction of users will appreciate. With the release of Android 16 in June, for example, Google updated the screen recorder dialog to allow you to select external displays, enabling you to record activity on them.

Homey Self-Hosted Server supports Matter, LAN, and cloud devices by default, with Zigbee and Z-Wave available via an optional Homey Bridge. The software is available worldwide with a free trial, followed by a monthly subscription or a one-time lifetime license. Homey seems to have recognized that there’s a significant overlap between people who like to build out a comprehensive smart home and those who also prefer running their own bespoke setups. With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control. Until now, Homey’s lineup has centered on a combination of cloud-based control and physical hubs, such as Homey Pro. With the Homey Self-Hosted Server, the company is opening up its pla…",

When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows. Scrolling screenshots are a relatively new addition to Android, introduced back in Android 12 . Since then, Google has barely touched the feature, but it’s finally preparing a small but welcome quality-of-life improvement. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Reddit users say Gemini also struggles with basics like calling contacts, setting timers, and handling follow-ups. Google’s shift from Assistant to Gemini for Home is a step forward in many ways, but it hasn’t really been a smooth transition. Google Home users are still running into missing Assistant features, and it now appears that one commonly used capability many people took for granted is gone in Gemini for Home, unless you’re willing to pay up.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new Counterpoint Research report predicts that smartphone prices will rise in 2026, with average selling prices increasing by as much as 6.9% as memory costs surge. The same report points to shrinking shipments and higher manufacturing costs, pushing smartphone makers to potentially cut specs like RAM and limit budget options. For consumers, this means phones launching next year will be pricier while offering fewer meaningful upgrades. If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

Battery life is typically okay for us on Google’s latest, but depending on the workload, Pixel 10 phones sometimes offer shorter battery life than last year’s Pixel 9 series did. Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile has added cash payments to its T-Life app, closing a loophole that let in-store customers avoid using it. The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",
