Hosted by Majah Hype at Brooklyn&#8217;s King Theatre (Aug. 28), this year&#8217;s Caribbean Music Awards honored performers and works across reggae, dancehall, soca, R&amp;B, gospel, bouyon, zess-steam, konpa and more, highlighting the myriad styles that have helped Caribbean music and culture remain a global force. Thanks to his collaborations with Shenseea (&#8220;Hit &amp; Run&#8221;) and Romain Virgo (&#8220;Been There Before&#8221;), Masicka was the second most-awarded artist of the night with four trophies.
