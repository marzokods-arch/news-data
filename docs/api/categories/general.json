    "body": "J Balvin and Residente surprised fans by sharing a joint Instagram post on Wednesday (Dec. 31) that appears to symbolize reconciliation after their highly publicized feud since 2022. The rift stemmed from Residente&#8217;s &#8220;BZRP Music Sessions #49&#8221; with Argentine producer Bizarrap, a diss track aimed at Balvin that reached No. 22 on Billboard &#8216;s Hot Latin Songs chart in 2022 and currently boasts over 203 million views. The fallout between the two Latin icons was revisited last Friday (Dec. 26) as Balvin released his own collaboration with Bizarrap, “BZRP Music Sessions #62/66.” In the photo shared on Instagram, the artists are seen chillin&#8217; casually, smiling at the camera. The Colombian juggernaut sports a t-shirt and light blue denim jeans, while the Puerto Rican rapper wears a t-shirt and beige cargo pants. &#8220;Given the immensity of things happening in the world, this is possibly one of the smallest. But in such a complex world, two people who don’t agree on everything being able to reconnect seems valuable to us,&#8221; Balvin captioned the post in Spanish. He continued: &#8220;Months ago, we met up. We listened to each other. We understood each othe…",

The certificate was presented to Mayor Eduardo Paes on stage in Copacabana. According to the institution, the city confirmed the presence of 2.5 million people in 2025 on the stretch of sand in front of the stage on the beach. “Millions of people, coming from different parts of Brazil and the world, took part in the celebration that turned Rio’s waterfront into a unique spectacle of music, culture, lights and fireworks,” said a representative of the organization. For the arrival of 2026, the Copacabana stage will host exclusive performances — including Belo with Alcione, and Gilberto Gil with Ney Matogrosso. “I’d like to thank Guinness for the tribute. Every time this story about the number of people at Copacabana’s New Year’s Eve comes out, there’s a lot of questioning.
