It's Dishonored by way of Dick Tracy: an immediate and stylish neo-noir FPS dripping with pulpy comic art and a tantalizingly interactive goon sandbox. And that's just the first episode, which launched into early access last year . Fans have been eagerly awaiting the second episode since then, but a development update on Steam confirmed yesterday that it won't hit its old release window of \"before the end of 2025.\" That said, it did share some exciting details, as well as a brief teaser. The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas. If nothing else, it seems like the second episode will lean in even harder to the over-the-top comic book action. The rest of the update shows off some new areas, story comics, and teases Delia, a \"fully controllable NPC companion\" that responds to commands like \"move there,\" \"stay here,\" and \"shoot that fuckin' guy!\" It looks…",

And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

I've always liked the idea of a charging dock conceptually, but I've never quite committed to getting a bit of gaming gear with one for a specific reason: I'm a bit lazy. I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard .

However, 2025 has seen the rise of several reasonably-priced contenders that can swim remarkably close to the pricier players for minimal expense, and that's the sort of development I can really get behind. Each of the three microphones below is very well-priced for what it delivers, and also happens to be one of the best mics we've tested all year. All that's left now is to give one of our contenders the best microphone of 2025 award, so we'd better round up our nominations into one big capsule-shaped basket, hadn't we? If you're looking for the cheapest of the cheap, look no further than the Amazon Basics USB Condenser Microphone .

So when it comes to picking just three, it's been something of a tough call. Still, first and foremost has to be the Fractal Design Scape , a headset with a clever magnetic wireless charging system that's been something of a game changer for me, and takes pride of place on my desk. Ah, if only the Scape had its own way. Extremely tough competition, though, comes in the form of the Razer BlackShark V3 , an updated model that managed to knock the long-reigning HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless from its top cable-free spot in our best gaming headset guide when we reviewed it earlier this year.

In the old days I had no choice but to resort to amateurishly recording sound tests onto tape so I could carry some sweet chiptune bangers with me at all times. In more recent years I've gone spelunking in places like iTunes, but inconsistent regional availability, seemingly random tags that omit or misspell an artist's name or list soundtracks under a generic publisher label can make game music frustratingly hard to find. Thankfully, things are getting better—and especially on Steam. I can buy and listen to standalone soundtracks in a click or two. Capcom has enthusiastically embraced this new distribution method, offering over 100 albums on its store page , from headliners like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6 to games' that aren't available on Steam.

After all, the basic archetype for a good one is pretty much sorted at this point—a comfy headband, two earcups, a microphone, and a great set of drivers. I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting.

The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls.

Gaming keyboards left and right have started to offer a ton of gaming features and really great typing feel and build quality. The topper is that many of the fantastic keyboards we're seeing popping up—the Gamakay x NaughShark NS68 on this list, the NuPhy Air60 HE , or the Lofree Flow 2 , to name a few—are priced very well for what you're getting. That's especially surprising for overtly gaming-oriented keyboards like the NaughShark, given that historically you'd often have to essentially pay a gamer tax for extra features and build quality. There are almost too many keyboards to choose from this year, but we've managed to narrow it down to just three nominees for t…",

That was nearly seven years ago at this point, but the game is turning even more heads today: it just hit an all-time concurrent player peak on Steam, according to SteamDB . Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap. As everyone rushes to burn their Steam wallets on the best deals, such an acclaimed game for the price of a pack of gum is a no-brainer.

The time of extreme skill ceilings and the pursuit of metallic ranks defining every new multiplayer FPS is behind us. The escalation of gaudy, overpriced cosmetics created a distaste so palpable that Call of Duty had to desperately change its game plan. The two biggest shooters this year cost money, and there were no major free-to-play releases. The theme of this new era, as I see it developing so far, is remembering that shooters can be both casual and thrilling. High fun, low emotional investment. An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed.

This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things.

I'm also constantly asked by gamers, both online and in the real world, what PC they should buy on a budget, and my response often starts with: \"What do you mean by budget?\" We exist in a space where an \"affordable\" gaming PC usually costs the best part of $1,000, and that's before you get to the monitor, the keyboard, and all the rest of it. Budget by PC gaming standards, sure. Budget by almost any other? Not really. It's a lot of cash, no matter which way you look at it. And now, thanks to a memory pricing crisis that looks destined to become much, much worse before it has any hope of getting better, those budget rigs are starting to become even more expensive. Our hobby has always had a gatekeeping aspect to the price of entry, but now? It's becoming downright ridiculous. You can still buy a sub-$1,000 prebuilt with great specs, but that's while current stocks last. All indications suggest that, come 202…",

So what happens when you try and stuff that core gameplay system-shaped peg into a gacha-shaped hole? Well, you don't. Instead, you remove it. Persona 5: The Phantom X still retains some kind of calendar, but set dates have been swapped out for a far more vague \"yesterday, today, tomorrow\" system. It makes sense for a game that is constantly shifting and changing with story and character updates, but making that move wasn't an easy one. \"Initially it was very difficult to convince the team that we needed to get rid of the calendar system,\" Chief Producer Yohsuke Uda tells me. \"When we created the game the most important thing we wanted to do was maintain that Persona 5 gameplay and game feel. But if we kept the calendar system from Persona 5, there might be differences in how each player played the game and some people might be on a different date. So it would be difficult to make sure everyone had the same experience.\" (Image credit: SEGA) Uda says that ditching that for a broader system was key to being able to \"maintain that Persona 5 fee…",

It's not been an easy journey, to say the least. The game's launch was criticised for stark differences between reward distribution in the Chinese version versus the global release and was arguably (and very surprisingly) eclipsed by horse girl gacha Umamusume: Pretty Derby releasing just one day sooner. In the time since global launch, the teams at both Sega and Atlus have been hard at work on The Phantom X to bring the standards up to what gacha gamers have come to expect. When I asked what the team's biggest initial challenge was, operations director Yuta Sakai told me: \"It was definitely the game balance or the balance of the events. So when we created the Japanese and English versions, we made various adjustments from the original release—the Chinese and Asia versions—and it was mostly focused on the quality-of-life and making sure that the game would fit new players because we had some extra features that were not originally present when it was first released. \"But of course, we had…",

We've all done it: excitedly told a friend that they should read a book (or play a game, watch a movie, etc) that you think they will like. Then you wait. You wait for weeks. You don't pester them about it because you don't want them to associate your overeagerness to share your favorite thing with the thing itself, sullying the experience.

It started with the surprising revelation that every FromSoftware protagonist outside of Elden Ring Nightreign is exactly 5'7\", a fact I learned from a YouTube investigation by FromSoft savant Zullie the Witch. I'd always assumed FromSoftware protagonists were taller than this. I'm not sure why, but it's probably due to how Anglo-American entertainment media has programmed my brain to perceive heroic archetypes as tall, dark and handsome. So finding out that all FromSoft's dodge-rolling warriors are the same height as me was surprising, leading me to think more deeply about how we represent height in games. Some of this manifested in bizarre tangents, like when I bugged Arkane Studios level designer and The Black Parade director Romain Barrilliot to help me figure out the height of Garrett from Thief. Interestingly, it turns out that Garrett's height varies across the games. He's exactly six feet tall in Thief: The Dark Project , slightly taller in Thief 2: The Metal Age (though this extra couple of inches may be pur…",
