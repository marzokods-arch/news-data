The Peaceful Hips emote was added to the Fortnite store earlier in September, before being promptly removed just a few days after Peacemaker's sixth episode of its second season aired. The reason? Well, the episode revealed a pretty major plot twist: John Cena's character has been milling around in a seemingly-perfect alternate universe… which turned out to be an America that lost to Germany in World War 2. An all-white America, a swastika in place of the American flag's stars. A Nazi utopia, essentially. We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros.

The upside is it's fantastic; the downside is it's got me playing Counter-Strike again. Those games ain't quick (especially since they removed the short game mode), and my aim ain't what it once was. But that's improving quickly, in part thanks to the Sabre V2 Pro. I first got my hands on it at Gamescom, though I had to keep schtum about that at the time. But I can tell you now: I was genuinely taken aback by how light it is. I'm used to my Logitech G Pro X Superlight for competitive gaming, and I do still love that mouse , but it weighs 63 g, almost double this Corsair one. Part of what impressed me about the Superlight when I first fell in love with it was how it managed to achieve such a light weight while keeping its shell intact—sturdy, and free from holes. The Corsair's done that here, too,…",

Both a killer budget-oriented GPU and a bit of an inconsistent mess, it is clear that the hardware is impressive, despite all the crashes we got while testing. What's even less impressive, however, is its performance alongside older processors. The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022. Where the B580 was once outshone by the 8GB AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT in the same test, they now stand neck and neck. However, it's n…",

Unfortunately, as he calls it, this whole thing's going to result in more industry layoffs . Ah, it's happening again. The buyout is a leveraged buyout, which Darrah says means \"EA is going to have an additional $20 billion of debt on its balance sheet. Obviously, adding $20 billion to your balance sheet is going to require you to pay a lot of interest. If we look at EA's current financials, they're netting out about $1.1-1.2 billion each year. If that $20 billion is sitting at a 5% interest rate, that's $1 billion of interest that needs to be paid every year just to service that debt.\" He adds that, \"for a company that's as historically financially conservative as EA, you're going to be looking for additional cost savings.

How to Complete the Running Like Clockwork quest in Disney Dreamlight Valley When you've unlocked the quest, speak to Cogsworth and he will ask for your help tackling some \"troubling issues in the valley\". This basically means he is unhappy with the state of some of the villager homes, with Vanellope being the main target, and wants to hide them behind some screens which you have to craft.

Which is perhaps the most excited I've been for silly videogame skins since Epic let me gun people down as Hatsune Miku. In case you're not Saja Boys-pilled, here's a quick rundown on K-Pop Demon Hunters: Rumi, Zoey, and Mira are part of girl group Huntr/x—and also happen to be demon hunters, hence the name—with the movie following their story against demon boy band, the Saja Boys and protecting folk through strengthening the anti-demon barrier known as the Honmoon. It all sounds rather daft when I try and put it down on paper, but K-Pop Demon Hunters is wonderfully witty, both cribbing from and poking fun at K-Pop and K-dramas. It's a refreshing original story wrapped up in the excellent animation work seen in some of Sony's other recent ventures like the Spiderverse films. And, as someone who grew up deeply entrenched in second-generation K-Pop back in the late 2000s, the Saja Boys give me all the same fuzzy feelings that BigBang did back then. K-Pop Demon Hunters went straight to Netflix back in June and, well, has become a bit of a smash …",

A couple of the minibosses in Hades 2 present as much challenge as the Guardians who act as each zone's bigger final boss, and the Phantom sure is one of them.

With Monster Hunter Stories 3, Capcom finally seems to be giving its RPG spin-off the scope and budget it deserves to really pop off. This light turn-based RPG series, which casts you as a young monstie rider instead of a monster hunter, didn't come to PC until last year, even though it debuted on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. There was potential even then, but the YA story and rock-paper-scissors battle system seemed guided by the mistaken impression that the audience for Pokémon-likes is still first and foremost kids, and not the thirty/fortysomethings who grew up with them. In the 45 minutes of Monster Hunter Stories 3 that I played last week at TGS, it tried to distinguish itself from the jump.

Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info…",

Even should he avoid jail or get a minimal sentence, he faces up to three years of supervised release. Those are some potentially life-changing penalties, and should certainly give a certain breed of keyboard warrior pause for thought.

Before you start, you'll need the Beauty and the Beast realm already unlocked and both Belle and the Beast living in your valley . Once done, you'll receive a letter in your mailbox from the Beast regarding his friends, Cogsworth and Lumiere, at the castle. He wants you to go and check on them, and gives you some white rose petals too. Reading this letter will immediately begin the challenge of unlocking Cogsworth and Lumiere. How to complete the Haunting of the Beast's Castle quest First off, head to the Beauty and the Beast realm and walk straight to the library. The realm will look a lot different to what you're used to, with spiderwebs covering the walls and candles lighting the way. Lumiere will be standing by the fire when you enter the library, so speak to him. He will ask you to help him craft some fuel for the firepl…",

In place of that, it'll be adding its own increasingly-comprehensive suite of tools, such as a cooldown manager, buff tracker, and a more customisable personal resource bar. But one lingering thought has been rattling around in the back of my head: is Blizzard just swapping out one arms race for another? If we take Final Fantasy 14 , for example, user interface AddOns are completely against the terms of service—and in common enough use that they routinely scupper World First races . During a group interview in a recent summit for the expansion, I asked game director Ion Hazzikostas whether or not Blizzard was concerned about AddOn authors simply creating third-party tools that go against the terms of service anyway. After all, if you draw a line in the sand, there's gonna be people who walk over it. Hazzikostas was remarkably collected about the idea, though: \"We've approached this in a couple …",

It's an eye-watering price tag, pitching up with a 90% markup over the MSRP of the standard RTX 5080 .

Now you can try it for yourself—the game's first public demo is out on Steam now .

That means you can play through two levels in arcade mode—the streets of NYC and the SHIELD helicarrier—with nine playable characters, including favourites like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. It's a pretty brief taste, but it gives you a great idea of what the final game is going to be like—and I recommend replaying the two levels a few times with different characters to see just how far developer Tribute Games has pushed the different movesets.

For a start, it's got such a neat integrated desktop stand, it's kind of astonishing to me that I haven't seen something like it before. Essentially, the SoloCast 2 comes as what appears to be one cylindrical unit with two boom arm screw mounts integrated into the bottom (⅜-inch and ⅝-inch, if you were wondering), making it seem like a standard, stand- less, microphone design. Break it apart like a shotgun breech, though, and it opens to reveal a hidden hinged base roughly one fifth of the way up its frame. It's a robust hinge, too, which means it's weighted enough in its movement to stay at exactly the angle you set it at in a desktop position, with plenty of mass at the bottom to prevent it from accidentally tipping over.

As it stands, you're only able to ride horses, donkeys, mules, camels and pigs in Minecraft, so it'll be nice to shake things up and get new mounts to help you traverse open stretches of water as well as just land. Especially now you can craft a saddle. Here's everything we currently know about the Mounts of Mayhem update. When will the Mounts of Mayhem update be released in Minecraft? The Mounts of Mayhem update doesn't have a release date yet, and seeing as the Copper Age drop just launched, it will be a few months before we see the next update rolled out. With that said, this update has been referred to as the fourth drop of 2025, so…",

    "body": "Honeycomb is the only way you'll be able to wax your copper crafts and prevent them from oxidising in Minecraft , so knowing where to find honeycomb is pretty important. Especially if you have copper golems sorting out your base, or you've decorated floor to ceiling with various copper items. Luckily, it's not too challenging to gather as long as you've got the right tools and know where to look. A good way to start your hunt for honeycomb is by looking for bees, which spawn most frequently in meadow biomes. Venture to your nearest one, and you can start following them to their hive. But, you won't just be able to walk up to it and harvest honeycomb like you're using a chest. Here's what you need to do instead. Where to find honeycomb in Minecraft The key to gathering honeycombs is by locating a bee nest. But, rather than any old nest, you're looking for one that has already been pollinated and is filled with honey . This is indicated by the spots on the side of the hive, which are usually brown and dark, appearing golden and honey coloured. When you've found one, walk up to it and use shears, and up to three honeycombs will drop. Shearing a nest or hive will anger the bees inside…",

As cameras panned around the Las Vegas venue of COD Next, I tried and failed to identify anything real. There were the LED walls, which flanked attendees on all sides with larger-than-life Call of Duty logos. There were the hosts, overflowing with excitement for Black Ops 7's meager alterations to CoD's current form. There were the hyped creators in attendance, many of whose livelihoods are directly intertwined with the success of Call of Duty. And there was Black Ops 7 itself, a back-to-back sequel that not even its developers appear to feel strongly about. It was the pinnacle of videogame marketing excess: loud, abrasive, and insecure. Between extended ad reads for Little Caesars Pizza, AMD, Monster Energy, and Herman Miller chairs, we were treated to Black Ops 7 multiplayer with live commentary that fluctuated between 3 am infomercial and awkward riffing over gameplay that could easily be mistaken for the last handful of games. Much like Call of Duty itself in recent years, the stream had an air of importance and awe that didn't line up with our eyeballs. Developers took the…",
