    "body": "Cardi B and Nicki Minaj have a complicated history dating back to about 2017. Fans began to speculate about whether or the not the two New York City rappers liked each other as they clamored for them to collaborate and show solidarity for the sake of the five boroughs after the Bronx rapper bursted on the scene with her smash record &#8220;Bodak Yellow.&#8221; The two would finally link up, albeit unknowingly, on the Culture II single &#8220; MotorSport &#8221; alongside the Migos — which was well received at first, but then was quickly mired in controversy after Cardi suggested on London&#8217;s Capital Xtra radio show that Minaj may&#8217;ve edited her verse. &#8220;Well, you know, when I heard the track, her verse wasn&#8217;t finished,&#8221; Cardi B said . &#8220;Or it&#8217;s not the verse that it&#8217;s on right now. And Quavo told me that to get on the song, and I just felt like it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity for me to be on a track that&#8217;s big like them. Cause those are two big people, and I just started in the game. And I just know if I get on this record, it&#8217;s gonna be crazy.

And how will the judge decide that question? Billboard turned to the experts to find out. According to Tama Kudman, a veteran defense attorney at the law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner LLP, much will depend on whether the judge sticks to that limited verdict.

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone.

And to those who one day left Puerto Rico dreaming of coming back, and to those of us who are still here, I don’t want to leave!” “I don’t want to leave” — No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí — the name Bad Bunny gave his Puerto Rican residency, is intrinsically tied to his album DeBÍ TiRAR Más FOToS (I Should Have Taken More Photos), a love letter to Puerto Rico and the island’s music that Bad Bunny dedicated on its back cover “to all the Puerto Ricans around the world.” It may as well have said, “To all the world around Puerto Rico.” Since the album’s Jan. 5 release (on the eve of Three Kings’ Day, a significant holiday on the island) and since the July 11 launch of the residency, “No me quiero ir de aquí” has become a rallying cry of pride for both Puerto Ricans and the multicultural global …",

The Aerial button even remembers the direction from Street View when transitioning into Satellite View, enhancing the user experience. Google Maps has a ton of great features that make it one of the best navigation apps on Android . One such feature is Street View, which presents users with images of the actual street and surroundings in mapped areas. Street View allows users to explore neighborhoods virtually, but there isn’t a clean method to seamlessly transition from Street View to Satellite View (which is also useful for virtual exploration). Google could soon solve this with a new Aerial button that lets users transition from Street View to Satellite View in a matter of seconds.

You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation.",

Amazon unveiled its fall 2025 hardware lineup today, complete with new additions to the Kindle , Fire TV , Echo , Blink, and Ring families. Tie all that together with the AI processing power of Alexa Plus , and you’re looking at a pretty solid collection, capable of pulling off some seriously impressive technological feats. And my favorite thing there might have been a dinky little $20 light switch. To be fair, this is more than just a simple switch, and the $19.99 Amazon Basics Smart Dimmer Switch and Remote for Music and Routines does a whole lot more, as its mouthful of a name should hopefully convey.

Some users are seeing that keyboard button change to an arrow/open shortcut, allowing you to quickly open an app right from the keyboard. Google only appears to be testing this with a small number of users, with unclear plans for a wider rollout. The Pixel Launcher ‘s search bar is already one of its best features, allowing you to quickly perform a Google Search or find an app right from your home screen. According to some user reports, it appears that the latter functionality may soon receive a notable upgrade. As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it. If you tap the search button at the bottom right of your keyboard, the Pixel Launcher (annoyingly) searches for the app name on Google rather than opening it.",

He ended up missing a flight and required hospital assistance to have the device removed. Samsung later told Android Authority it was an “extremely rare” case. The user himself suggested that saltwater exposure might have been a factor, which we speculated could make sense given that the ring’s IP68 rating doesn’t stretch as far as protection against saltwater.

Much of the skepticism is driven by a fear of product abandonment, poor software performance, or Gemini making basic controls worse. Some commenters remain hopeful about the platform’s future. It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future. The original piece argued that new hardware, a redesigned Home app, and the integration of Gemini could finally put Google’s smart home back on track. However, the comments reve…",

Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this.

Ultimately, the issues surrounding the protection of our planet remain as critical as ever. That was the backdrop for Climate Week NYC 2025, where renewable energy specialist Jackery stepped forward to share its message of turning lofty promises into practical action. The company made its debut at the annual summit during the “SEE the Future” forum on September 25, co-hosted by organizations including the World Economic Forum’s GAEA initiative, the SEE Foundation, the Foundations Platform 20, and Columbia University’s Climate School. Jackery’s Global Head of Brand and Public Relations, Tracy Wang, joined a panel alongside UN and academic leaders to tackle a pair of big questions: how green energy supports ecological conservation and how to build lasting alliances for sustainable development. “Green energy shouldn’t stop at the product — it must be the infrastructure behind ecological protection and climate response,” Wang told the audience.",

The latest Play Services update brings Fast Pair support to Audio Share. The feature is available on Pixel 8, Pixel 9, and Pixel 10 series phones, except for the Pixel a-series devices. One of the key audio improvements that Google has brought to Pixel phones with Android 16 is Audio Share . It lets you cast Bluetooth audio to multiple connected audio devices — or listen to the same audio via different phones — simultaneously. Using this feature, up to 20 devices can connect to the same audio, which is excellent whether you want to share your music or watch a movie with a large group of friends. However, when you’re allowing other people to connect to your audio stream, you must either pair another pair of headphones manually or scan a QR code using another phone that’s already connected to those headphones. Now, that’s becoming a little easier as Google has added support for audio sharing through Fast Share.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google has published new promo videos for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro. The Pixel 10 clip is classic Google, criticizing Apple fans for their “vanilla” choices. The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Update, September 29, 2025 (01:48 PM ET): One week later, Google has another one of these “design” videos to share, this time focusing on the smaller Pixel 10: And once again, we are looking at a video that is just 1,000% vibes — evocative, maybe, about Google’s design process, but offering precious little in the way of actual insight.",

    "summary": "In Android 16 QPR2, the Linux Terminal can access almost the entirety of your phone’s shared storage.",
    "body": "TL;DR The next quarterly Android 16 update will significantly improve file access for the Linux Terminal app. Currently, the Linux virtual machine is limited to accessing only the phone’s Downloads folder. The update will expand this to nearly all shared storage, making file sharing much easier. The Linux Terminal app can transform your Android phone into a full-fledged mobile PC by giving you access to powerful tools not natively available on the platform. With it, you can use readily available Linux programs to turn your device into a web server, convert media files, run AI models locally, and much more. Many of these tools work with local files, but sharing them between the Android host and the Linux virtual machine is currently a hassle. Fortunately, the next version of Android will significantly improve the Linux Terminal’s access to your phone’s files. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "Spotify will let you choose between truly random shuffle playback or fewer repeats.",
    "body": "TL;DR Spotify has been building new options for controlling randomness during shuffle playback. Listeners will have the option for random playback, irrespective of what was played before. They’ll also be able to reduce repeats, by taking recently played tracks out of the running. People have a problem with randomness. We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.

The Google Home ecosystem seems like it’s on the verge of a real glow-up. Google’s announced that Gemini will make its way to Google Home starting this week, and earlier this month, we brought you exclusive coverage of an upcoming overhaul to the Home app that should make it less of a slog to deal with. Google also teased an unannounced, Gemini-powered speaker at its awkward hardware event in August. Our own Joe Maring asked last week what’s got you all most excited about the new chapter Google Home is entering, and thousands of you answered. There’s a clear winner in our data: A full two thirds of those who answered Joe’s survey are most looking forward to one aspect of what’s about to change.",
