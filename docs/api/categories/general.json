We rounded up 20 milestone moments from 1976 which we’ll discuss in depth. But first, to get you in the Bicentennial Year spirit, here’s a quick 1976 chart flashback (using the chart names that Billboard used at the time): Most weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100: Rod Stewart’s “Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)” (seven weeks, plus one more week in 1977) Most weeks at No. 1 on Top LP’s &amp; Tapes: Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life (11 weeks, plus three more weeks in 1977) Most weeks at No. 1 on Hot Country Singles: C.W.

According to new Luminate data, the song experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams after soundtracking the end credits of the series’ final episode. Over the previous five months, “Heroes” had averaged approximately 94,000 daily streams. That figure jumped sharply in the days following the finale’s release, reaching roughly 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3 — representing a 3.6- to 5-times increase over its typical daily performance. The placement marked a full-circle moment for the series, which has become closely associated with 1980s music throughout its run. In earlier seasons, the show famously used a cover of “Heroes” by Peter Gabriel, making the finale’s use of Bowie’s original recording a deliberate callback. In an interview with Netflix’s Tudum, Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed that the idea to use Bowie’s version came from cast member Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington. “It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do…",

RingConn also promises longer battery life with the new smart ring. It’s more inclusive and stylish, expanding to 10 sizes for a better fit and offering five jewelry-like finishes. Smart rings have stayed pretty much the same for a while, so if yours still works, there hasn’t been a big reason to upgrade. That’s starting to change. At CES 2026 , RingConn is launching the Gen 3, which promises more than just a small update over Gen 2 . The RingConn Gen 3 still uses titanium but now comes in five colors and three finishes: Brushed Silver, Brushed Rose Gold, Polished Future Silver, Royal Gold, and a new Matte Black. Unlike Gen 2’s limited options, Gen 3 looks more like jewelry you’d want to wear.",

This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

    "body": "Buying a projector instead of a TV may seem like a stretch, but buying one alongside a TV makes much more sense. These days, projectors are brighter, sharper, and far more forgiving than they used to be. The models I’ve been testing deliver a genuinely enjoyable viewing experience even in lighting conditions that used to send me scrambling for blackout curtains. Built-in Google TV also strengthens the projector push. It helps turn what used to be an obnoxious setup process into something refreshingly TV-like, especially since features like autofocus and auto keystone correction handle fine-tuning.",

The page reveals that Privacy Display will be located in the Settings app, in the Display section. An animation showing how the feature works was also spotted on the page. Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

It has a larger 1.3-inch display with slimmer bezels, up to 14 days of battery life, two microphones, and step/sleep tracking. Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

Most of these headlines were expected, such as Samsung’s conservative Galaxy S25 series and the well-received Pixel 9a . However, 2025 also saw more than its fair share of headlines that were simply hard to believe. So with that in mind, we’re taking a look at some of the most unbelievable stories of the year.",

The update brings more brightness and smoother automatic setup, while keeping the same familiar design. The Freestyle+ will be showcased at CES 2026, with global availability expected later in 2026. As CES 2026 approaches, the projector category is shaping up for a busy few days. Samsung, however, isn’t waiting for Vegas to make moves. Today, the company announced the Freestyle+, a refreshed version of its popular portable projector. If you’ve followed the Freestyle line since its debut, the new model will look familiar. The Freestyle+ sticks with the same compact, self-contained design as previous models, complete with a cylindrical body and 180-degree rotating stand. The flexible setup still allows the projector to throw an image onto walls, floors, or ceilings, and it’s still easy to move from room to room without much effort.",
