Mahomes shared some moments from the festivities to her Instagram on Sept. 3, along with a photo of her and Swift accompanied by the caption &#8220;THIRTY.&#8221; In the photo, Swift was seen styled in a Victoria&#8217;s Secret Classic Silk Corset in black. The silhouette is fitted and plunging with thin shoulder straps and structural panelling meant to cinch the waist and create shape, hence the term shapewear. Accompanying her all-black number, Swift sported a few gold accessories, including a Jacquie Aiche Marquis Diamond Snake Head Roll chain, a custom Lorraine Schwartz T necklace and, of course, her glitzy new engagement ring.

Each piece of equipment was designed for rapid loading and unloading from tightly packed semitrucks, sometimes multiple times per day, and to perform flawlessly during the show. The fast pace means that some shows must be created without a pre-rig — typically set up in advance by a smaller crew to install essential rigging like motors and trusses — meaning the entire show must be assembled and struck within a single day.&nbsp; That’s a daunting task which requires “us to bring on the smartest guys we know in touring — SGPS ShowRig,&#8221;&nbsp;says TSO tour director Elliot Saltzman , who has worked with the Las Vegas-based company since 2006. “They became part of the team, not just a vendor.&#8221;&nbsp; Related &#8216;Taste of SoFi Stadium&#8217; Offers Preview of Venue&#8217;s Latest Bites for Football Fans, Concertgoers &amp;&nbsp;Beyond Miranda Lamber…",

Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

It adds performance updates, driver downloads, UI improvements, and bug fixes. The update also adds support for Hollow Knight: Silksong, which released just yesterday. It’s been just over a month since the Nintendo Switch emulator Eden dropped the release candidate for version 0.0.3, but after a few rounds of revisions, it’s finally ready for a stable release. The Yuzu fork adds a ton of new features and improvements, plus improved game compatibility. For starters, the update features a number of Vulkan, JIT, and CMake bug fixes, which should provide a small performance boost on all machines. That includes Windows, Linux, and of course, Android.",

The MagFlow Qi2 25W lineup includes a 10,000mAh power bank, a wireless charging pad, and two- and three-in-one charging stations. The Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Qi2 25W wireless charging, while other Pixel 10 models are limited to 15W. All iPhone 17 series phones are expected to feature Qi2 25W wireless charging. One of the biggest highlights of the Pixel 10 series is Pixelsnap , Google’s branding for Qi2-based magnets baked into the phones. This allows the Pixel 10 series to be used with a wide variety of Qi2 accessories. If you just grabbed a new Pixel 10 series phone and wanted to get a few accessories to complement it, UGREEN has launched its new MagFlow Qi2 25W lineup for faster magnetic charging. Every Pixel 10 model supports Qi2 charging, but there’s some nuance involved that you should be aware of. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold top out at 15W with Qi2-certified chargers when paired with a 20W or higher USB-C adapter.

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025. Most e-readers stick to the basics: an E-Ink screen, a bookstore tie-in, and enough battery to survive a long vacation. At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an “AI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.” This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed. On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn’t shared an actual usage estimate.",

    "body": "XGIMI has unveiled the Horizon 20 Series with Google TV at IFA 2025. The new projector lineup includes the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max with 5,700 ISO lumens. Pre-orders open on September 5 in the US and UK, with shipping beginning in October. XGIMI is turning up the brightness in home entertainment. This afternoon at IFA 2025, the company introduced the Horizon 20 Series, its most luminous projectors yet, featuring Google TV. With this launch, XGIMI sets its sights squarely on home theater heavyweights like Epson and BenQ. The Horizon 20 Series comes in three variants, the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max, but it’s the Max that steals the spotlight. With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room. That puts it ahead of most portable Google TV projectors and even in the same conversation as mid-range home units from brands like Epson.",

While I believe the phone is a solid purchase, the more important question for many is whether it’s worth upgrading to from last year’s Galaxy S24 FE . In short, the answer is no. The days when a yearly smartphone upgrade made sense for most people are long gone. The incremental changes between generations are simply not significant enough to justify the cost. I’ll explain exactly why that is and which phone you should consider buying if you’re truly fed up with your Galaxy S24 FE.",

Android 16 introduced Google’s take on a Desktop Mode for Android, and the new version of Samsung DeX is based on it.

Samsung is refreshing its flagship Android tablet lineup today with the introduction of the new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. These tablets come with incremental changes over the previous Galaxy Tab S10 series, and we’ll walk you through all of those. Let’s start with the immediately apparent change: the naming. With this launch, Samsung is eliminating the Plus variant — for now, at least — and reviving the standard Galaxy Tab S11, which features a smaller 10.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution. A similar lineup rejig is expected of the Galaxy S26 series , where Samsung is likely to eliminate the Galaxy S26 Plus and rename the base Galaxy S26 to S26 Pro.",
