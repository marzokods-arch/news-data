I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice. This latest update also gets rid of \"incorrect placeholder assets\" in the almanac, which players claimed had been AI-upscaled , and makes the gu…",

The trailer showcases the Hive Scum's crowbar, one of the class' improvised melee weapons (they can also swing a saw), as well as their dual-wielded guns. For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins. Like all of Darktide's player-characters the Hive Scum gets plenty of cosmetic options, with full-body tattoos and punk hairstyles, and they're the only class to have access to face paints so far.

Nobody thinks the lady with the big deadly sword is a healer, but they also can't figure out if she's going to be a tank or a damage-dealer. Usually, Blizzard makes it pretty clear how a character will play in the game, even if their reveal cinematic is mostly focused on their backstory and isn't captured in-game. Vendetta's video is a tricky case because we see her cut apart a robot—pretty damaging by any measure—but also block its shots with her gigantic sword almost like a tank would. That's not unprecedented: Overwatch already has tank heroes, like Junker Queen, who could easily be mistaken for damage-dealers because they don't carry around a big shield like Reinhardt. It doesn't help that Blizzard hasn't clarified what role Vendetta will be in the video's description or on social media, leaving it to fans to try to suss out the answer. But here's the thing: Blizzard, or at least a PR agency representing it, already confirmed Vendetta's role in an email to press right after the trailer went out. PC Gamer, along w…",

Like, say: 📌An emulated Macintosh Classic 2 that unexpectedly crashes on boot, leading to... 📌Intense debugging in the emulator and on another old Mac revealing a 34-year-old bug, leading to... 📌Buying and repairing a Macintosh Classic 2, leading to... 📌Confirmation that it indeed never should've been able to boot in the first place. But the Apple Macintosh Classic 2 did boot just fine, which is what makes the pay-off of this blog from programmer Doug Brown so great. Through an intense, labyrinthine series of tests using both software and hardware, Brown discovered that the final all-in-one Mac to use a black & white screen shipped with a bug that would have disastrously crashed the computer every single time you turned it on—if not for a miraculous, unknown feature of its Motorola 68030 CPU that hid the problem from Apple's programmers.

Opting out of big clans on official servers has never been the easiest way to play Rust, but recent monument, scrap, and blueprint reworks have turned the island into a real bloodbath—moreso than usual. Historically, scrap has been pretty easy to get, and its abundance throughout the map made crafting upgraded workbenches easy. Playing it safe and farming scrap around your base meant fewer people out in the world for PvP, but the strategy worked. As a solo player, I could visit monuments to find a little treat, but I didn't need to venture into the wild as soon as possible. The update largely reduces scrap cost, but tacks on a new material requirement with two types of Blueprint Fragments. You can get lucky and find some of them, but monuments have guaranteed drops in special puzzle rooms. The changes would make more sense if clan domination was the goal, but the October blog on the meta shift specifically notes it's for \"creating a soft progression gate that pushes players into early fights a…",

Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines.

The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause.

Their project, 'Project IRL', is, as they put it , one that allows them \"to put on a full fledged game stream experience anywhere I’d like utilizing the capabilities of the ROG Ally and Ally X with one doing AAA Gaming and the other grabbing the recording and putting together the stream.\" In other words, it looks like a project to allow them to become an IRL streamer, whilst also gaming on the move.

The way Demonschool weaves old-school apocalyptic vibes with tactics-based combat brought out the beast. I devoured it in a matter of days, and it pulled off something no other RPG has managed before: make me fall in love with the ways of the isometric grid.

Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this.

That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures.
