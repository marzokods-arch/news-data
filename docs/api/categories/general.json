See, WoW's a wizened beast with expansions in the double digits to its name, and if you keep slapping continents on the old girl, it's going to stop feeling like a World of Warcraft and more like a hodgepodge...er, of Warcraft. Anyway, we know that we're going to get a redesigned Northrend again for the next next expansion , The Last Titan, but Blizzard's also considering taking a new lick of paint to some long-standing cities, too; beloved places that haven't seen an overhaul since Cataclysm which, not to make you feel old or nothin', came out 16 whole years ago. That's per our cover feature for the upcoming issue of PC Gamer, written by PCG contributor Heather Newman. In it, Heather spoke to both manager for visual development Gabriel Gonzalez and Paul Kubit, associate game director and lead on the expansion itself. \"It was a little scary, honestly, to go back in to tackle that zone again,\" says Gonzalez regarding Silvermoon and the Ghostlands, given their nostalgia-drenched pos…",

    "body": "Word reached me this morning that hot new PvP raid shooter Highguard has an unusual bug. According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

With a bunch of big successes under its belt, you might expect CEO Tim Bender to be looking to expand, swallowing up more and more indie games to increase his chances of finding another hit. But not only is he completely disinterested in publishing more than around 10 games a year, focusing on stability over growth , his advice to indie developers is to avoid indie publishers entirely. \"People can hate me for this if they want,\" he says, \"but most indie publishers are not people indie developers should work with. The vast majority of indie publishers, in their whole structure, are predatory and opportunistic.\" This could all be a cunning ploy to stick it to the competition, but Hooded Horse isn't exactly struggling to find developers to sign. Bender's warning to devs is also consistent with the rest of his publishing philosophy, where \"ethical treatment of developers is critical\". He wants to be a positive influence, he says, as evidenced by his championing of fair contracts where developers don't need to wait for the publisher to recoup …",

With the ongoing second season of the TV show , a replay of Fallout: New Vegas , and the usual pitstops in Fallout 76 , I see VATS every time I close my eyes. But that's probably pretty common for fans right now, especially for those enjoying the second season so much they want nothing more than to experience it for themselves. And while New Vegas obviously has the most accurate in-game locations, Fallout 76 also has some excellent nods to the show with the latest Burning Springs update .

There's the Rust King's domain, the odd, deteriorating traveller hub, and even some giant plastic dinosaurs.

Since that time, Valve has actually announced its very own Steam Controller . Yet TommyB says \"that doesn't change anything\" and his controller looks better than ever. It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map.

And yet, despite the fact imsims are god's own genre, no one ever makes them. Why? Oh, because they're hard to make and no one buys them? I guess that makes sense. That's my takeaway from a recent chat that Nightdive CEO (and System Shock Remake director) Stephen Kick had with FRVR . \"They don’t perform financially the same way that other genres do,\" said Kick. \"It’s a known fact, you make an imsim game you’re going to be appealing to a very small, niche group of fans that are going to love it, they’re going to be very vocal about it, and they’re going to try to convince their friends to play it, and they may or not be successful.\" That small, niche group of people is me and, I'd hazard to guess, you. But apparently we don't represent a market demographic large enough to move the C-suites of the world. So why does Nightdive keep working on them? Well, it agrees with us: Kick says the team \"don’t generally take in financial performance as a metric for whether or not we work on something or not, but w…",

Instead, it's primarily been found in weird hybrid tablets , ridiculously expensive handhelds , and a select few similarly expensive workstation laptops . It looks like that might soon change, though. Lenovo has been cooking up some new gaming laptops, some of which it showed off for CES 2026 (including one with a rollable screen ), and it's just hinted that a Strix Halo laptop might be in the works. Specifically, a 'Lenovo Legion 7 15ASH11', which was for a while listed as a supported model for its Legion Space software (via VideoCardz ). This is the Lenovo Legion 9i Gen 10, featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia RTX 5080 mobile. (Image credit: Future) Note the 'ASH' there, which presumably stands for 'AMD Strix Halo.'

Intel remains tight-lipped regarding handheld implementations of its impressive new chips, with the only word I've heard on the matter being something shown to the public \"soon\". So, I'm left with little but speculation for now. Still, we can have fun dreaming together, can't we? Handheld gaming PCs are currently in a bit of a weird space, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, there are plenty to choose from, but it's quite telling that the Steam Deck still crops up with regularity as one of the top recommendations. Its APU is really starting to show its age in 2026, and while it still makes a fantastic value proposition, I'd primarily recommend it as an indie gaming machine if you're looking for smooth performance.

Between the two of them, you've now decided that your next gaming laptop is going to be Panther Lake-powered and sport a big GPU from Nvidia, to go with Intel's big Xe3 tile. You're possibly going to be disappointed, then, to know that you're almost certainly not going to see any such lappies coming to market. The reason why is quite simple: it all comes down to the number of available PCIe lanes in the platform controller tile. Intel has two variants of this chiplet: one with 12 lanes (four are Gen 5, eight are Gen 4) and the other with 20 lanes (eight Gen 4, twelve Gen 5). The important thing, though, is that every Core Ultra 300-series processor that has the big 12-core Xe3 iGPU uses the 12-lane platform controller tile. AMD and Nvidia's mobile GPUs are designed to use at least eight PCIe lanes. That doesn't mean you can't fit a discrete GPU alongside a 12-lane PTL chip; it's just that it will leave just four for everything else inside the laptop. The majority of NVMe SSDs require fou…",
