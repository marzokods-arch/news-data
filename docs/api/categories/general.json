Fortunately, you can build an army of mythical creatures including satyrs and half-naked giants who rend and stomp loggers with abandon. Maybe you are a bit villain-adjacent. The demo I played at PAX Australia gave me a home tree and a single hut to protect, but let me grow more trees each night to produce the resources I needed to summon defenders. Willows are expensive and finicky about being planted near water, while the spruce don't give a damn where they grow, but produce less of the magic juice I need to cast spells and summon goblins and vodyanoy. Once I'm done with a night's planting and summoning I press the button to begin the day, and waves of humans with axes and bows start marching in.

But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you—as long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits.

The good news amidst the bad is that a demo for HOMM: Olden Era is now available on Steam , offering players access to the game's tutorial and three different singleplayer modes, using four \"very different factions\" of the six planned for the early access release.

Bridges and Ports was originally expected to launch in mid-2024, a few months after the release of the Beach Properties asset pack earlier that year. But Beach Properties was such a mess that Paradox eventually apologized for the whole thing and just gave it to everyone for free, and ultimately delayed the expansion into the second quarter of 2025 so it could focus on the main game, which was also a mess. Then it delayed Bridges and Ports again, to near the end of 2025 , because everything was a mess. But apparently now that's all been sorted, at least enough that the expansion can be unleashed on the public. The Bridges and Ports expansion will add 20 new drawbridges and lift bridges, customizable ports, a new Ferry Transport System, \"expanded maritime industries\"—fishing, offshore oil rigs, that sort of thing—and three new maps, more than 100 assets, and new achievements.

    "body": "Unfortunately, I'm not of an age where a rotary mechanism inspires wistful nostalgia; for me, looking at an old rotary phone is a bit like looking at a fascinating evolutionary dead-end, a path not taken by tech. Well, Google Japan's latest bit of whimsical concept kit seeks to reinvigorate the rotary wheel. The Gboard Dial Version is a keyboard that eschews clicky-clacky keys for the burbling whir of nine rotary mechanisms instead (via The Verge ). For those unfamiliar with how this is supposed to work, rather than depressing a key, you jam your finger in the hole above the corresponding character you wish to type, drag the rotary wheel around as far as you can, and then release. There you go, you've 'typed' a single alphanumeric character—now on to the next one. It's a decidedly drawn-out process that would stop my hot takes long before they threaten to boil over, that's for sure. Oh, did I mention this concept keyboard comes with a stand that looks like an old-timey cradle for a landline phone? You can switch off your camera in video calls when you rest your mouse atop this cradle. That's not quite as dramatic as slamming the receiver down to end the call, but I can appreciate …",

    "body": "A tale of two laptops, this little article of mine is. Or perhaps I should say a tale of two GPUs instead. Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit). Both feature damn near close enough the same form factor, and both are targeting the same budget-centric audience as well, and come with remarkably similar hardware underneath. On…",

Battlefield 6 is set to release on October 10, but this is different based on time zone, so when you can actually play will vary. There also isn't any early access to the game (no, not even with the deluxe edition), though pre-purchasing will get you the Tombstone Pack, which has an additional skin.
