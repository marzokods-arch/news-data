Santa Ragione filed an appeal, but it was rejected 12 hours later with no further explanation. Epic also indicated the game could be updated to bring it into compliance, but \"the email did not include any information on what would need to be changed,\" Santa Ragione said, and even if it had there'd be no way to make extensive changes one day ahead of release.

But in the 10 years since Shovel Knight first appeared, developer Yacht Club Games has struggled to produce a full-on follow-up hit, and in a new interview with Bloomberg , studio founder Cris Velasco says it will be in serious trouble if its next game isn't a success. That 'next game' would be Mina the Hollower , a sort of gothic Link's Awakening that was revealed to the world in 2022 . \"It’s make-or-break for sure,\" Velasco said. \"If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good.\" Development of Mina the Hollower has been troubled, according to the interview. The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often. Next up for the World of Assassination is a co-op mode, which has yet to be given a release date, though you'd expect it to be well after the March 2026 release of 007 First Light. \"I would say [Bond] is probably the…",

The game's been out for eight years, after all, and if nobody's escaped yet, well, nobody's ever going to. But, as Tarkov aficionados are no doubt lining up to tell me, all of that time was spent in beta and early access: The full 1.0 release didn't happen until November 15 of this year, a major update that added—among other things—the \"non-linear story campaign and end-game content.\" So that's why it took so long for someone to …",

One other key takeaway is that OLED burn-in happens fastest in the first six months, after which further degradation seems to be more gradual. As before, this test is described as a worst-case scenario for OLED use and based on the MSI MPG 321URX QD-OLED , a 32-inch 4K model. That means Monitors Unboxed isn't using it for gaming but the daily computing grind with lots of static content for eight hours a day. The channel also only runs MSI's OLED panel compensation cycle at the end of the eight hour working day, not at the four-hour intervals that MSI recommends. The idea, in other words, isn't to baby this monitor but use it just as you would an LCD panel. And you don't have to break off from work in the middle of the day for 10 minutes to run compensation cycles on LCD monitors. In total, Monitors Unboxed has been running this monitor for about 60 hours a week or 250 hours per month for the past 21 months and thus has clocked up over 5,000 hours of largely static use.

This coincides with Black Ops 7's Warzone integration too, so the battle royale mode will also be getting a big overhaul on December 4. Keep in mind that Black Ops 7 continues the tradition of seasonal updates effectively coming in two halves, as the Season 1 mid-season update arrives \" in the new year \".

Then there's Skate Story—which is about a less-haunted, but equally weird, moon—and Unbeatable, a rhythmic adventure game set in a world where music is illegal. December's schedule also features the usual end-of-year shows, including our very own PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted , and The Game Awards a week after.

Greetings from a post-Thanksgiving stupor, FPS enjoyers. I had a nice AFK holiday with family, but in the back of my mind I was riding the high of the night before, when my friends managed to assemble a party of nine Master Chief Collection owners (shout out to the $10 Steam sale) to play classic Halo 3 custom games. It was a blast, and if you have any fondness for early Forge creations like Halo Jenga (seen below), I can't recommend it enough. The good times got me thinking about a PC gaming maxim that says an FPS is always better with mouse and keyboard. I was diehard about this for a long time—plenty of shooters feel fine on a controller, but I couldn't imagine a scenario where the precision of a mouse isn't a demonstrably better experience than thumbsticks. Recently, I've loosened my grip on that perspective. Yes, the mouse reigns supreme when speed and precision are major factors in a shooter, and that is often the case. Echo Po…",

Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps.

It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone .

Today's brought us a few interesting findings, so let's dig in. Starting with the NAND flash prices, TrendForce reports that the demand for NAND flash used in SSDs is strong. To the surprise of no one, that demand is largely fueled by large enterprises (thank you, AI), meaning that's where the manufacturers currently have their focus. The massive demand has led to a short supply, which then led to a price increase in November. The monthly average prices for wafers rose from 20% to 60%. Triple-level cell (TLC) memory was the most impacted. This type of NAND flash stores three bits of data per memory cell. Quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash is also in high demand and short supply.

That came to an end when Ridgeline closed in early 2024 as part of major cuts at EA , and so Grivel tripped back to Ubisoft to work briefly on \"an unannounced project in conception phase.\" He left again at the end of 2024 to join Worlds Untold—just in time for that studio to fall victim to major cuts at NetEase . And now he's back where it all began. \"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!\" Grivel wrote on LinkedIn (via GamesRadar ). \"A very special team and project to me.\" If you're hoping that Grivel follo…",

A particular triumph? Its episodic release structure, which even won over our Fraser Brown —noted episode-sceptic—quite quickly. Indeed, the game's executive producer Michael Choung said the format had \" absolutely proven itself \" two weeks ago—sustaining interest in the game over a longer period than a one-and-done release likely would have. But Choung doesn't see the approach as some kind of magic bullet AdHoc—or any studio—can just apply to everything. \"It's insane to do,\" he told Edge's Knowledge newsletter . \"From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this.\" The game's lead producer, Natalie Herman, agreed with Choung: \"From a production perspective, we released four times. We were basically a live-service game for a month.\" The point Choung is making isn't that episodic releases ought to be avoided—that'd be an odd move from a developer whose game is on-track to beat its three-year \"bull case\" sales projections in three months—but rather that anyone looking on…",

    "body": "Did you know that the Wayback Machine is currently archiving web pages at an incomprehensible rate of 150 TB of data each and every day? Oh, and that it's located in a church in San Francisco? News outfit CNN caught up with the Internet Archive, which incorporates the Wayback Machine, recently. Located on Funston Avenue in San Francisco in a large neoclassical building that used to be a Christian Scientist church, the Wayback Machine now maintains 29 years of web history. Back in 1996 at the inception of the archive, a whole year's worth of webpages added up to about 2 TB of storage. Now, a mere day soaks up 150 TB and a copy of the entire archive is 175 petabytes and counting upwards . In October, the Archive celebrated the successful storage of one trillion web pages. While a set of servers have been \"symbolically\" placed in the former church building, the whole archive isn't actually stored in the Funston Avenue locale. Most of the archive’s servers are in a warehouse outside San Francisco, with copies distributed throughout the world. Those backups aren't just prudent in the event of fire, flood or other physical catastrophe. CNN points out that the Trump administration has de…",

    "body": "It's not even a debate: the best CPU for gaming by far is the Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and that's been the case ever since it launched. And before that, it was the Ryzen 7 7800X3D . And before that... you get the picture. But, it seems that AMD is now quietly looking to dethrone its own top chip with a slightly improved version, dubbed the Ryzen 7 9850X3D. The CPU has just appeared on AMD's driver page (spotted by Olrak29 ) with zero fanfare and zero details. Love that for us—we get to speculate a bit. The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz. That gives it a 400 MHz advantage over the 9800X3D. (Image credit: Future) A little bit of extra clock speed isn't much to write home about, especially when the CPU's greatest strength lies in its humongous 3D V-Cache, not…",
