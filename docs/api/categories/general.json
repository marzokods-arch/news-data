Blow sat down with me to chat about the game before its reveal and, what with him being so inextricably associated with puzzle games as a genre, I asked what he thought of the state of the genre in the modern era. Does he think it's in a good place? Does it seem particularly interesting or innovative to him as a space? \"No, I don't think it is,\" said Blow. \"And I'm not sure why, because I do feel like there are quite a few really good games in the past that people could look at, if they're sitting down and making a puzzle game… there's enough games that have done really interesting things that you should be able to look at them and, really, go from there, but I don't feel like people do.\" The way Blow sees it, too many puzzle games focus on pure difficulty at the expense of tying their puzzles into something broader—some kind of overarching theme…",

And yet, a Micron-made SSD survives in 2026. The company has just announced the Micron 3610 NVMe SSD , which it bills as \"the industry’s first PCIe Gen5 QLC client SSD, powered by Micron G9 NAND.\" This release suggests that not only is Micron keeping at least a toe in the consumer market despite what was implied mere weeks ago , but that the company may even help pave the way back to reasonable storage pricing. Historically, QLC isn't what you want anywhere near your SSD, due to its high bits per cell leading to sluggish performance and questionable reliability. But times are changing; last year, SK Hynix introduced 321-layer QLC flash memory chips that boasted 100% faster transfer speeds and up to 56% greater write performance than earlier QLC memory.

However, DLSS is still AI-based and in a Q&A session with members of the press, CEO Jensen Huang made it clear that artificial intelligence isn't just for improving performance, it's how graphics needs to be done in the future. This much we already know, as Nvidia banged its neural rendering drum starting at last year's CES and then throughout 2025, and it wasn't the only graphics company to do so. Microsoft announced the addition of cooperative vectors to Direct3D, which is pretty much required to implement neural rendering in games, and AMD's FSR Redstone is as AI-based as anything from Intel and Nvidia. So, when PC World's Adam Patrick Murray asked Huang, \"Is the RTX 5090 the fastest GPU that gamers will ever see in traditional rasterization? And what does an AI gaming GPU look like in the future?\", it wasn't surprising that Nvidia's co-founder avoided the first question entirely and skipped straight to the topic of AI. \"I think that the answer is hard to predict…",

The earbuds feature a \"breakthrough hybrid five-driver acoustic system paired with a sophisticated three-way electronic crossover.\" That crossover refers to a 10 mm dynamic driver, a 6 mm planar driver, dual balanced armatures, and a \"micro-planar tweeter.\" Presumably the whole \"three-way\" thing is excluding the latter tweeter, as that's just more planar gubbins. So, there's a mix of dynamic, planar, and dual balanced armatures here. We've seen plenty of triple-driver earbuds before, but not so many that are specifically mixing planar with dynamic. This combination is probably what helps the price stay so \"low\", as these are \"set to launch this Spring at $200.\" That's expensive, of course, but it's hardly the, err, $1,300 of the fully Planar Audeze Euclid .

Key specs: 27-inch | 1440p | 240 Hz | 0.03 ms | QD-OLED View Deal I say this pretty much every time an OLED monitor deal pops up, but I can't overstate how much of a difference swapping to an OLED gaming monitor made to my setup. It's truly a night-to-day difference, especially when the truest blacks of the night sky fully stand out. If you fancy finally taking the leap, the best way of getting an OLED panel on a decent budget is this AOC Q27G4ZD at $420 on Amazon . That's a $30 discount. Join us on WhatsApp for daily deals , direct to your phone. I look after our roundup of the best cheap gaming monitor deals every week, and this AOC choice is the lowest price for a QD-OLED monitor in our list. In fact, the closest to it will cost you another $80. This AOC screen has near competitive gaming level stats, with the 240 Hz refresh rate being a good bit above the average screen, and the 0.5 ms response time being super snappy.

But in the case of the Maxwell planar magnetic gaming headset, Audeze has given it 16 \"community inspired\" improvements and just as importantly, rolled out a fresh new app for all its audio gear. Naturally, the new version has a simple moniker, the Maxwell 2 , and a cursory glance through the spec sheets shows that Audeze has kept the fundamentals very much the same as the first iteration. Which is a very good thing, as the original Maxwell headset is outstanding, and there's been nothing to beat it as the best for gaming audiophiles since it launched two years ago.

There's also an X account that tracks them , cataloguing them via a website called is.xiv.up.

Spoiler: You won't be able to get them from the safety of your base. No, you'll need to gear up and venture out to explore the planet. While you don't actually have to go all that far to find the Rotor and Tube blueprints (both are located in the same area, thankfully), it is heavily infested with scary monsters. Whatever you do, don't stroll on over with just your mining laser. You should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets. StarRupture Rotor and Tube blueprint locations As shown in the video above, you can find both the Rotor and Tube blueprints in the SMB 'Purple Haze' outpost, also known as Selenian's Mining Base, to the northwest of the lander where you start the game.

    "body": "A laptop's panel can account for over half of its overall power usage, according to Intel, hence why it's teamed up with Samsung Display on a new OLED technology to reduce power consumption by as much as 22%. It's called SmartPowerHDR. It works by analysing each frame's peak brightness in real-time, sending that data to the panel's Timing Controller (TCON), which then optimises the voltage sent to the panel based on how many pixels are active on-screen. More or less, it's adapting the voltage depending on what the screen displays. Today's HDR modes apply a fixed voltage. \"Traditional HDR modes remain locked at maximum brightness, resulting in excessive power usage even in standard scenarios,\" the press release reads. \"As a result, many laptops default to SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) mode despite the color and brightness advantages of HDR.\" The benefit, as reported by the two companies, is around a 22% power saving in general usage with SmartPowerHDR, or around a 17% reduction during HDR content. True HDR content is going to request a higher voltage more often, such as a game with HDR support. Whereas things like web browsing, finding files or typing in documents don't really need …",

Unveiled during CES 2026, it's the Taiwanese company's 12th 'Signature Chassis' and it's called Aeon. However, its angular glass panelling is hardly the most dramatic thing about it. Don't get me wrong, the mosaic mirrored panels are very snazzy but perhaps a little too attention-grabbing for any room I could realistically picture it in. With a base measuring 840 mm by 691 mm plus a height of 912 mm, it's not just these odd angles that present a practical placement challenge either. Buckle up, because the InWin Aeon PC case possesses one of the most extra opening mechanisms I've yet seen . First, you need to trigger the opening mechanism by swiping an RFID card across the PC case's base. Then, the case's back opens and is gently lowered to lie flat via a hydraulic mechanism. This is meant to afford easy hardware installation but it's a whole lot of fanfare just to open your PC case—Not to mention additional potential points of failure. InWin isn't calling this a 'Signature Chassis' for no reason. It's currently unclear whether the Aeon will …",

If you've been placing Ore Excavators and other key machines willy-nilly, and they're not turning on despite having an army of solar panels, then you know something's wrong. Below, I'll go over how you actually connect power to the various tech around your base, which I've learned the hard way. How to generate and connect power in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) To connect power to your base in StarRupture, you need to build a generator of some kind, like a solar panel, and connect it to machines using either rails, platform foundations, or bridges . There are no wires in StarRupture, but all rails and floor pieces conduct electricity. Ideally, then, your base won't have any dirt visible by the end as you'll cover it all with walkways and machines to daisy-chain power.

    "body": "It's not a huge surprise because we saw this happen in 2024 , but Prime Video's Fallout series has once again led to a huge uptick in people playing the Fallout games on Steam. Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and even Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts have essentially doubled their daily concurrent players on Steam since Fallout Season 2 started airing on Prime Video in December. Via SteamDB , we can see that in the weeks leading up to the show's premiere in mid-December, Fallout 4 was typically averaging about 20,000 concurrent players, but as of Sunday that count had risen to over 40,000. Likewise, Fallout: New Vegas was pulling in roughly 8,000 concurrents a day, and that rose to nearly 20,000 last weekend. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: SteamDB) Even Fallout 3, which was typically attracting a mere hundred or so concurrent players on Steam on an average day, has risen to close to 200—not exactly a towering number, but still about double what it was before Fallout Season 2 started. Fallout 76 got a bump too, up to about 30k from the usual 10-20k average, and the original Fallout saw an influx of players as …",

Typically players are expected to use a weapon specifically designed to pierce the Worm's nigh-unbreakable shields, but that instruction has driven true AC6 sickos to prove their mech piloting prowess by destroying the mechworm without the Stun Needle Launcher. In November, X user @IBIS824101 put out a call for AC6 aces to go even further by toppling the Ice Worm without the Stun Needle Launcher and while taking no damage. Earlier today, user @2K_heso posted a late response with an additional escalation of his own: He destroyed the Ice Worm without taking damage, without the Stun Needle Launcher, using only melee combat. #AC6 アイスワーム空手でノーダメージ撃破を成し遂げました。150時間から200時間くらいかかりました。 https://t.co/yFh0wwLOCx pic.twitter.com/zWHfdxGV3t January 6, 2026 No guns, no missiles; just mecha-scale fisticuffs. \"I managed to defeat the Ice Worm with bare-handed martial arts for a no-damage clear,\" @2k_heso said. \"It took me about 150 to 200 hours.\" In…",

So it's maybe a bit, well, odd that Stranger Things co-creator Matt Duffer credits the inspiration for the show's finale to Baldur's Gate 3. But it's also pretty cool, right? \"We were thinking about D&D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,\" Duffer told Variety about the final battle between Vecna, the Mind Flayer, and the gang. \"Everyone had fully realized—either through self-acceptance or they've resolved all their various issues—moving into that final battle, they're absolutely primed. They're the ultimate team, and it's the party working all together to defeat this thing. \"And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that's where I go back to Dungeons & Dragons, and something like Baldur's Gate. Because that's how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lot…",

    "body": "With memory pricing ballooning to apocalyptic amounts due to demand from the AI industry , it doesn't feel like we've had much good news in the realm of SSDs in recent weeks. Well, Phison Electronics is looking to change that with the PCIe Gen5 controller it just unveiled at CES 2026. The E37T PCIe Gen5 controller may not sound like the sexiest hardware update, but I promise there's plenty about it that's at least eyebrow-raising. Basically, you can think of it as a great big step up from the Phison E31T, which features in our current budget favourite for the best PCIe 5.0 SSD for gaming , the Crucial P510 NVMe SSD . To make that short story a little longer, I'll borrow some of Phison's own words; the company touts the new E37T memory controller's ability \"to deliver competitive price-to-performance value for modern consumer workloads across notebooks and mobile devices.\" To cut through the marketing-speak, this memory controller should make PCIe 5.0 drives not only faster but just a little more affordable, too. Let's get into the numbers: according to Phison, \"E37T achieves up to 14.7 GB/s sequential reads and 13.0 GB/s sequential writes, with up to 2,000K 4 KB random IOPS.\" Bein…",
