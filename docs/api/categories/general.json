Set to drop on Tuesday (Dec. 2) on Netflix, the four-part documentary includes never-before-seen footage of Combs in the days leading up to his arrest last September. Combs’ attorney, Michael Tremonte , says in a Monday (Dec. 1) demand letter that the footage was recorded by the rap mogul’s employees and then “illicitly disclosed” to Netflix later on. According to Tremonte, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos first approached Combs about making a documentary back in 2023, but Combs rejected the idea when it became clear he wouldn’t have creative control. Netflix wanted to “punish Mr. Combs for refusing to play by its rules,” Tremonte says — so the company gave the producing gig and allegedly stolen footage to his longtime rival , 50 (Curtis Jackson). “The evidence of Mr. Jackson’s vicious animus against Mr. Combs is overwhelming. He has been trolling Mr. Combs on the internet and social media for years and has made a career of attempting to defame, belittle and provoke Mr. Com…",

Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 could alleviate notification spam by blocking specific apps. As per a recent leak, One UI 8.5 may put apps with “excessive ad” spam into a state of “deep sleep.” It may also begin analyzing notifications on device to ensure they’re only blocked if they’re spam. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung reportedly scrapped plans to use a larger 200MP sensor in the Galaxy S27 Ultra, likely due to cost and supply chain concerns. This rumor comes after Sony announced the 200MP LYT-901 sensor, a more advanced alternative to Samsung’s 200MP cameras. The next few Ultra models may stick with Samsung’s current 200MP hardware, with no major main-camera upgrades on the horizon. Sony just disrupted Samsung’s camera plans. After years of Samsung showcasing its in-house 200MP sensors in the Galaxy Ultra line, Sony has launched a sensor aimed directly at its rival’s strength. However, there’s bad news if you were hoping Samsung’s future Ultra phones would adopt this tech. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "EO Science Earth Observatory Rings of Rock in the Sahara Earth Earth Observatory Image of the Day More Subscribe September 13, 2025 In northeastern Africa, within the driest part of the Sahara, dark rocky outcrops rise above pale desert sands. Several of these formations, including Jabal Arakanū, display striking ring-shaped structures. Jabal Arkanū (also spelled Arkenu) lies in southeastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. Several other massifs are clustered nearby, including Jabal Al Awaynat (or Uweinat), located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast. Roughly 90 kilometers to the west are the similarly named Arkenu structures . These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock. Repeated intrusion events produced a series of overlapping rings, their centers roughly aligned toward the southwest. The resulting ring complex—composed of igneous basalt and granite—is bordered to the north by a hat-sha…",

    "body": "EO Science Earth Observatory Cranberry Country, Wisconsin Earth Earth Observatory Image of the Day More Subscribe October 13, 2025 Known as America’s Dairyland, Wisconsin produces the most cheese of any state and trails only California in the production of milk. Less famously, the state outpaces all others in a key part of many Thanksgiving menus. Wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries in the U.S., with its annual hauls accounting for more than half of the country’s total yield. The wetlands, cool climate, and sandy, acidic soils of central and northern Wisconsin provide the foundation for raising the tart berry successfully. This satellite image shows geometric networks of cranberry beds alongside small lakes near the town of Warrens, the “Cranberry Capital of Wisconsin.” It was acquired with the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 on October 13, 2025, during the autumn harvest season. When berries are ripe, growers flood fields with up to a foot of water and then use specialized machines to knock fruit off the vines. Because cranberries contain pockets of air, they float to the surface—turning entire fields red—to be corralled and removed . Beds are not all …",
