That path first led to Toilet Spiders, a small horror game about scouring an abandoned government facility, lifting up toilet lid after toilet lid, hoping you find a key rather than a deadly spider.

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Samson on Steam Set in the fictional city of Tyndalston, described as the \"asshole of the world,\" protagonist Samson's past mistakes are catching up to him, and he'll have to punch and kick his way out of trouble. He's trying to pay off his debt and save his family, but he's got gangsters and police alike after him. The game is being developed by Liquid Swords , a Stockholm-based studio founded by Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalanche, which brought the Just Cause series and the underappreciated gem Mad Max to the world. So, there's a strong pedigree here for a game about a dude in a sick leather jacket who drives around in a menacing muscle car and beats the daylights out of anyone dumb enough to get in his way.

The in-game autobattles between Mokiton are described as a fusion between real-time and tactical turn-based combat.
