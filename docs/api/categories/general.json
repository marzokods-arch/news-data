Service Level Agreement (SLA) Click here to view the Service Level Agreement The SLA provides information about roles, responsibilities, rates, and service level indicators for all NASA Centers. The SLA is negotiated on an annual basis in line with the fiscal year. A single SLA is shared by all NASA Centers and signed by the Associate Administrator,&nbsp;Chief Financial Officer,&nbsp;Chief Information Officer, and the&nbsp;Office of Inspector General. The SLA provides for the delivery of specific services from the NSSC to NASA Centers and Headquarters Operations in the areas of: Financial Management Procurement Human Resources Information Technology Agency Business Services NSSC Bill (Formerly know as Performance and Utilization Report (PUR)) *** On-Line Course Management and Training Purchases have been realigned to the OLC &amp;Training Purchases section of the bill in accordance with the realignment of training funds.&nbsp;Center Special Projects have been consolidated int…",

In 2019, Betelgeuse dimmed in brightness , sparking speculation that it may soon explode as a supernova. While it likely won’t explode quite yet, we can preview its fate by observing the nearby Crab Nebula. A view of the constellations Orion and Taurus, along with notable features: Betelgeuse in Orion, and Aldebaran and the Crab Nebula in Taurus. Stellarium Web Betelgeuse is easy to find as the red-hued shoulder star of Orion. A variable star, Betelgeuse, usually competes with the brilliant blue-white…",
