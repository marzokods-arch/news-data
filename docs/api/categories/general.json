And while that DLC remains firmly in the realm of hopes and dreams for now, with a new year now upon us I am here to tell you that the foundation for that rumor has grown somewhat stronger. There are two big reasons for this.

IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could succ…",

Not only has its first midseason update arrived with a grip of new maps and modes, but it also marks Call of Duty's first big brand collaboration since last year's dustup over the series' major uglification problem . For the next few weeks, Black Ops 7 is all about Fallout. The half-season-long celebration coincides with the Amazon show's second season with operator skins for the main cast, themed modes, and a special Vault-Tec Nuketown makeover. In the months before Black Ops 7's release, Activision addressed growing unrest with Black Ops 6's cosmetic output—which included particularly gaudy Beavis and Butthead and American Dad partnerships—by promising that Black Ops 7 would be different. \"We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you,\" the August 2025 blog post read. \"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.\" If you took those words at face value, a Fallout makeov…",

Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement.

Once you've got your head around the likes of Wolfram, Titanium, and Calcium , you'll need to get this resource en masse. Luckily, the Helium locations aren't all that far away. I recommend you have a gun and a good bundle of bullets with you, as you're likely to run into some monsters on the way. Plus, you'll be right next door to the Stabilizer blueprint location , so you can nab that too. StarRupture Helium location Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Creepy Jar) While there are multiple deposits across the planet, the best place to find Helium-3 deposits in StarRupture is almost directly east of the lander where you start the game , near the Grubbler trees at the base of the mountain. Here you'll find two Helium vents that you can start harvesting. Take note that you'll need a Helium-3 Extractor , unlocked by reaching level six with the Slenian corporation, not the standard Ore Excavator.

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.

The idea is, you get a virtual 177-inch monitor beamed in front of your eyeballs via a Micro-OLED display within the glasses, covering 95% of your vision with a 57-degree field of view of excellent gaming fidelity. Why have a massive screen on your wall, when you can have a tiny one that creates the same effect in a wearable form factor ? Mmm. We'll get on to that in a minute, because I've got some ergonomic issues to discuss first. For a start, there's a substantial cable attached to the rear of the left arm, which makes putting them on a very awkward event.
