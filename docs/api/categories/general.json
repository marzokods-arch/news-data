Lucky me, there's at least one newcomer to the game somewhere out there. That's right: Spore is still moving units, er, unit, according to videogame industry analyst Mat Piscatella.

Path of Exile 2's The Last of the Druids update is coming on December 12. Druids will join the other seven classes and, because this is PoE, will come with a bunch of new skills that anyone can use. However, only the druids will be able to shapeshift into a bear and other animals on the fly. Developer Grinding Gear Games previewed the druid two years ago , and that was the last time we saw them. They didn't make it into the game for its early access debut and narrowly missed the last update. And now, it looks like GGG is ready to release them out into the world. In that preview video, you can see the pretty classic druid fantasy on display: In their human form they can call down lightning strikes and pull lava out of the ground, and then they can transform into a bear to pulverize packs of monsters.

They openly cheat, regularly bending or breaking rules to give computer-controlled characters an unfair advantage, so much so that even the shortest session can rapidly erode any sense of goodwill anyone ever had for blood-splattered fighting games. Learning how to consistently beat these frauds using some repetitive cheese only encourages bad habits that are neither useful against another player or in fighting games in general. (Image credit: Sega) I'm relieved we're not in those credit-munching days anymore, and that other games are around to show what good-hard CPU opponents can look like.

I wouldn't put much stock in that last one though. Rumors about a possible Sims 4 remaster came to a boil earlier this week thanks to a post by The Sims Community collecting a small handful of vague \"I know something you don't\" style posts on X by those claiming to have some inside info. It's either a \"rewrite\" of The Sims 4 or a \"remaster\" or \"Sims 4 HD,\" according to a variety of unconfirmed sources. There were also images leaked from a playtest—of what appears to be the same mobile Sims game playtests that have been leaking on the regular for around a year—along with mention of a \"platform for the future\" likely referring to the same The Sims Hub that EA vaguely announced last year and has yet to officially mention again.

Arriving on December 1, the free, limited-time Eminem vs Slim Shady mission sees the Detroit-based rapper recruiting Agent 47 to assassinate his young alter-ego, which has manifested on the material plane as a separate, homicidal entity. \"In his latest album, 'The Death of Slim Shady' the rapper attempted to put his other self away, but now Eminem recruits the legendary assassin Agent 47 to put his past away permanently,\" IO Interactive said in a press release. To serve as the battleground for this existential conflict, the Hokkaido map has been remixed into Popsomp Hills Asylum, an \"environment where doctors, patients, and performers blur into one,\" where Slim Shady \"delivers erratic live performances to a captive audience of staff and inmates.\" Presumably, Agent 47 thinks this is cool and fine. I don't know what force or magic has hewn Eminem into a bifurcated being at war with himself. I only know that, as of today, it is my duty, obligation, and sacred calling to kill Slim Shady with mom's spaghetti. The \"surreal new mission,\" IO Interactive sa…",

As reported by Kotaku , the park also features thrill rides, photo-op set pieces where you can pretend to hold Feastables with MrBeast himself, a seemingly endless spew of branded merchandise, and a stash of 1 million Saudi Riyal, or roughly $266,000 USD, which will go to the highest scoring Arena players.

Overwatch has always had significantly more damage heroes than the rest, but everyone accepted that as a consequence of it being the most popular role.

The latest plea for official Proton support started on Reddit , where Scout339v2 shared their screenshot of Rust running \"on a server with EAC disabled to show that the game already works perfectly on Linux.\" Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is the key factor here, and part of a broader conversation where Facepunch and its Linux/Proton userbase don't see eye-to-eye. While it's true Rust runs on Proton, you can't join official servers, and most unofficial servers, with EAC disabled. Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support.

If you're a big fan of Sung Jinwoo and his undaunted rise to become OP, either via the crazy-popular webtoon, or the two seasons of the anime adaptation, this might be one for you to check out. Anime tie-in games can be very hit and miss, but there is a Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive demo currently available on the Steam store, so you can try it without committing to anything. As with most big games these days, there is a premium early access period if you shell out for the deluxe edition, or you can wait until full release to play. Here are the Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive release times for each region. Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive advance access release date and time You can play Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive three days early on November 21 (or November 22 depending on where you are), if you pre-purchase the deluxe edition.

Including, potentially, causing its stock price to tank a whopping 15%. As for why? Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free. I should note that, in other MMOs, these sorts of limitations are a sign you're playing a trial, not a free-to-play game.
