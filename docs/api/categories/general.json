When the Welsh producer hit the road last fall in support of her fourth studio album Dreamstate , she would see this manifesto come to life during one particularly transcendent moment in her set. As the chorus of “Melt!,” a track from her 2020 LP Inner Song , began to descend, Owens would routinely point at one bright-eyed audience member on the barrier and cry out: “Girls love techno!” The floor would erupt in response. “People felt part of a special moment each time I did that,” she recalls, speaking to Billboard U.K. over Zoom from her grandparents’ home on the north Welsh coast, where she is recuperating from a busy festival season. “The idea of community is really important to me – I want to be able to live it out in …",

It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

This would allow Gemini to read the contents of other apps open in split-screen mode without an overlay or Gemini Live. The feature may be limited to book-style foldabes or tablets. Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini overlays have been two remarkable ways to let Gemini view content from other apps. But their application remains limited since the overlay closes as soon as we switch back to the other app. The other alternative is to share your screen with Gemini Live , but that may not match the regular interface in terms of functionality. Now, Google may be working to partially solve that by allowing Gemini to interpret another app’s content, though the application may be limited to a specific set of devices.

He says while the agreement between Rebble and Core includes a licensing fee of $0.20 per user per month, Rebble assert a 100% claim on its app store data. He counter-accused Pebble of “attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016,” and added he’s “working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source.”",

It’s safe to say that, in 2025, the notion that Android phones are cheaper than iPhones simply isn’t true. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

The app also allows users to message each other — and that feature is currently being abused by scammers. A post by user GaryB82 on the US Samsung Community forums details the message that’s been circulating. In the scam, an account posing as an official Samsung channel says that the recipient’s account urgently needs “verification,” directing the user to click a link and supply personal info. Failure to comply, the message says, comes with a fine. It might go without saying, but if you’ve seen received of these messages, do not click the link.",

The Steam Deck currently only downloads and applies updates while powered on. The upcoming Steam Machine will apparently support more convenient background updating options. Last week, Valve surprised us with the announcement of three new hardware products . None of them were a second-generation Steam Deck, but a Valve hardware engineer teased that the company’s thinking about a requested quality-of-life update for its handheld: to allow docked Steam Decks to update automatically, the same way the upcoming Steam Machine can while it’s idle. According to The Verge , Valve’s Yazan Aldehayyat told the publication that automatic docked updates are “something we are really interested in supporting.” Aldehayyat didn’t commit to bringing the feature to Steam Deck, but that Valve is thinking about it at all seems like a good sign.",

A reference to “CINNAMON_BUN” was discovered within the code of the latest Android Canary release. The OS is currently using the placeholder API level 10000, but it will eventually graduate to API level 37. Development on Android 17 is well underway, but we still don’t know much about the next major OS update. While we have an inkling about some of its potential new features, we lack concrete evidence confirming they’ll be included. We’ve even heard through the grapevine that Android 17’s dessert codename is “ Cinnamon Bun ,” but without official confirmation, we couldn’t be sure. Fortunately, we’ve now found strong evidence confirming that “Cinnamon Bun” is indeed the internal moniker.
