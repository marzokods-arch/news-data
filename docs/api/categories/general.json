    "body": "David Bowie’s 1977 classic “Heroes” is seeing a major resurgence on streaming platforms following its prominent placement in Netflix’s Stranger Things , which premiered Dec. 31. ( Warning: the following contains spoilers about the Stranger Things finale .) According to new Luminate data, the song experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams after soundtracking the end credits of the series’ final episode. Over the previous five months, “Heroes” had averaged approximately 94,000 daily streams. That figure jumped sharply in the days following the finale’s release, reaching roughly 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3 — representing a 3.6- to 5-times increase over its typical daily performance. The placement marked a full-circle moment for the series, which has become closely associated with 1980s music throughout its run. In earlier seasons, the show famously used a cover of “Heroes” by Peter Gabriel, making the finale’s use of Bowie’s original recording a deliberate callback.

Foldable phones have come a long way, but there’s one design flaw that refuses to go away — the crease in the middle of the screen. At CES 2026 , Samsung Display may have finally cracked that problem. At its booth on the show floor of the tech show, Samsung Display is showcasing a brand-new foldable OLED panel that appears to have no visible crease at all. According to SamMobile , the difference is immediately noticeable when the new display is placed next to the one used on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 .",

Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar.

SwitchBot also revealed the Lock Vision series smart lock, the AI MindClip recorder, an E-Ink Weather Station, and the OBBOTO AI desk light. By conventional definition, smart home products excel at one task, and they do it expertly. However, there is also a need for more generalist products. SwitchBot tried to tap into this market with the multi-tasking Robot K20 Plus Pro last year — a vacuum that can do more than just vacuum. This year at CES , SwitchBot is going all in on generalist smart home products with an actual robot. Meet the onero H1, SwitchBot’s first humanoid robot.

    "body": "TL;DR OnLeaks has published what appear to be images of Galaxy S26 dummy units. The units in the images should be nearly identical to the S26 series’ final designs. The Galaxy S26 series will have camera bumps that look quite a bit like the ones on Galaxy Z Fold phones. The new year is right around the corner, and that means we’re coming up on Galaxy Unpacked. The event is expected to take place a little later this time, with the Galaxy S26 reveal reportedly pushed back a few weeks. Today, though, a new leak is giving us a good idea of what the phones’ finalized hardware will look like. According to a couple of posts by OnLeaks on Twitter , the Galaxy S26 series will look more than a little like the Galaxy S25 series. One notable difference, though, is that the forthcoming phones’ camera bumps will look like the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones, with three individual camera lenses enclosed in a pill-shaped camera bump.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G and Galaxy Tab A11+ both arrive in early January. The previous Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone of Q3 2025. The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",
