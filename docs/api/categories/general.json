The Deck was never about performance flexing. It's about simpler, purer gaming fun and now you can get that for less cash than ever before. Nice. Key specs: 7-inch LCD | 1,280 x 800 | 60 Hz | 256 GB | 40 Whr battery | 45 W power supply View Deal In an age where a budget graphics card costs 400 bucks, the fact that you can get an entire gaming rig—and a portable one, at that—for something around the 300 mark has to be celebrated. So, let's give it up for the new price-reduced Steam Deck, yours for just $319.20 or £279.20 from the official Valve store . The Steam Deck was first released in 2022 and it is, unsurprisingly, the original LCD-screened model with the now entry-level 256 GB of storage that's had a 20% price haircut and therefore not the revised and improved OLED model .

However, the original Deck still has plenty going for it , especially when you consider that the OLED one isn't meaningfully faster in terms of game performance. Indeed, it wasn't meant…",

That's probably not information you care to fill your brain up with right now, but you might need to know it at some point soon as the latest games begin to require it to keep cheaters away. Secure Boot is a security feature within the UEFI and used for signing Kernel-level code that runs on your PC to ensure it's not, er, dodgy. The idea is, if everyone agrees to sign their code using cryptographic keys, an OS and its apps can be more confident that malicious software is not running in the background, such as a rootkit or low-level cheat software. Game developers are increasingly turning to Secure Boot to ensure their anti-cheat software isn't bypassed. Battlefield 6 has become somewhat infamous for requiring Secure Boot, through EA's Javelin anti-cheat software, though Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat and Riot's Vanguard also require it. Secure Boot will be required to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, too. The flipside is, there are a good deal of people that don't trust various game developers to have kernel-level access for their anti-cheat applications. The kernel is the most privileged part of you…",

Thanks for the slip up, Amazon. We already knew that Nioh 3 would be getting a simultaneous release on PC and PS5, so no more waiting around for us this time, but now we know when to expect it: February 6, 2026, which fits the \"early 2026\" window we were given previously. Before Amazon corrected its mistake, the release date could be seen on the listings for both the standard and Treasure Box editions, along with the first reveal of the PS5 box art. Sony's next State of Play airs during the Tokyo Game Show today, which seems like a more appropriate place to announce the release date, so it seems like Amazon Japan just jumped the gun. I'm pretty excited for this one. Nioh 2 is up there with the best of FromSoftware's fare, but like the greatest soulslikes, it's not content to simply ape a competitor's games. The varied weapon stances, ki system, transformations and randomised loot sets it apart, and, frankly, it's considerably trickier.

As spotted by VideoCardz , Maxsun has announced the GeForce RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA Plus S0 . This is very similar to the RTX 5070 iCraft OC12G AIGA , which it launched earlier this year. Both have three fans, and both GPUs have the same imagery spinning on those fans. Where the older model has a blue and white tint to said imagery, the newer one combines a grey and pink. However, spin that GPU around and you will spot a big change. On the back of this RTX 5070 card sits an anime cat girl with blue hair, a top hat, and a waistcoat. This gives her a magician's look. The previous card also has a cat girl, but a hole in the rear plate of the GPU gets in the way of the image, which means the new card will get you a smidge more cat girl, should you care a lot about cat girl economics.

But during the trickier traversal scenarios, such as when you're navigating a very narrow bridge or even something as thin as a tightrope, I found that it was basically essential to train that camera on Nate's feet via a top -down perspective. Just seeing Nate's legs is not enough! Just like this (thanks to Morgan Park for the video): In other words, don't just let the camera languish on Nate's butt. Move it around, but especially move it up. The physics in Baby Steps are detailed and fun to mess with, but even when you're just walking along seemingly safe surfaces, a simple obscurely placed rock can send you tumbling. It's fine to fall—sometimes in Baby Steps you have to fall—but…",

The only paths back up involved even tricker rocks, and predictably I fell again, tumbling off the grassy ledge to land next to a mudslide. Fortunately there was a dry path beside the mud, and unfortunately I found a single rock on that path, tripped, hit the mudslide, and slid to the bottom of it.

The first Model M (or then, the IBM Enhanced Keyboard) was the keyboard IBM threw in with its 3161 model terminal and, outside of the typewriter and industrial models, is the genesis for the keyboard in the mainstream with the features that have become ubiquitous elsewhere, most notably key placement for things like the Control and 'inverted T' arrow keys .

And hell, Epic was right: over 126,000 concurrent players flocked to it during its weekend stint, according to IGN , making it one of the most popular game modes on offer during that time. I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them. Sounds kind of fun in practice but hey, this is the internet we're talking about. What's an open voice chat without having a slur or two hurled your way, eh?

    "body": "All things come to an end, though when it's related to tech, it often seems like the end comes quicker than the lifespan of a hamster. That might feel like it's the case with a move by Intel to end routine driver updates for all its graphics chips, bar its recent Alchemist and latest Battlemage GPUs. As explained in a knowledge base post , Intel has split its GPU drivers into two distinct packages: those for Alchemist and Battlemage-powered GPUs and a set for everything else from the past five years. In the case of the latter, that means the integrated GPUs in every 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Gen Core processors, as well as anything with an Iris Xe GPU. These will no longer receive game-specific updates, including 'day 0 support' (where a new game gets extra tweaks in the drivers to make it run properly at launch), and instead will just enjoy quarterly driver updates containing security or critical fixes. Unless it's super-critical, of course, in which case, updates will appear as needed. Given that gaming laptops are still being released in 2025 with 14th Gen Core CPUs, this might seem like a bit of a daft move by Intel. However, the gaming performance of the tiny iGPUs in all it…",

Riot just revealed that 2XKO will officially enter early access on October 7. No more closed beta, no more invite codes. The bad news is that it's still a PC-only deal—despite our PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S pals being included back in the 2024 beta, they're still being left out of the main event for now. There's no word on when the game'll go multi-platform just yet, unfortunately. (Image credit: Riot Games) But for those of us on PC, early access marks the start of 'Season 0' as well as the debut of 2XKO's 10th champion, which Riot is still keeping firmly under wraps. Well, it's trying anyway. A datamine of the game's upcoming battle pass included a graphic of Braum, Yasuo, and Darius sporting new costumes alongside a picture of rat mascot Teemo.

We've pulled together all of Cogimyun's one, two, and three-heart gifts to save you the struggle of discovering them for yourself. Best gifts for Cogimyun in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Similarly to every other character, you can only give Cogimyun three gifts per day, unless you use a Friendship Blossom to reset her daily gift allowance. When you start out in Wheatflour Wonderland, there are a few items you can pick up around the map to boost Cogimyun's friendship, such as Noodle Grass and any critter. These are great starting points, but it's best to not rely on them for too long. The following …",

    "body": "Innovation in the world of PC motherboards is surprisingly rare, as we've been using the same format, sockets, and connectors for a long time. Which is probably why one component maker has decided that a brand new design and format moniker is what's needed to shake things up a bit. The only problem is that the whole thing is all kinds of wrong. \"More than ITX, this is YTX.\" That's the marketing tagline by Maxsun for its new Terminator H770YTX D5 motherboard . Unfortunately, the tweet also says \"Innovative motherborad solution\" and you can already guess what memes have appeared in the comments to the post. ⚡More than ITX.

It's a board design that's the same width as mATX but the same height as ITX. Or if you prefer numbers, YTX is 245 x 175 mm, whereas mATX is typically 245 x 245 mm, with ITX usually being around 172 x 172 mm. That's i…",

    "body": "My experience with the Little Nightmares series has never been solo. Although both the first and second games only support one player, while I've made my way through the hopeless settings of both, I've always been watched. My sister sat screaming in fear over my shoulder while I navigated the first one, and my housemates in university happily attempted to instruct me through the second. I was fully ready for Little Nightmares 3 to be the first I actually played on my own, until the demo released and I realised it had co-op—foiled again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first of the series to feature co-op, and after just 30 minutes of crawling through Necropolis, I've come to the stark realisation that the entire series, or at least the sections where there's already an NPC companion by your side, would've greatly benefited from supporting two players. You still have the option to play with an AI companion if you'd rather go alone. If it's anything like the companion in the second game, then I'd much rather recruit a second player than watch a computer stumble around trying to get in the right position to complete a basic puzzle.
