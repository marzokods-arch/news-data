    "body": "TL;DR Calling Cards offer a great way to customize how incoming calls appear on your own phone. So far, though, the system has lacked a way for you to choose how your Calling Card will appear remotely. A new “My calling card” screen could finally give you that opportunity. Apple’s got its Contact Posters on iOS, and earlier this year we saw Calling Cards arrive for Android, letting users customize what they see when their friends and family call. Google’s already been working to add new options there, like letting you fine-tune the fonts , but this whole time there’s been a fundamental problem with how Calling Cards work — and now it looks like Google might actually get around to resolving it.

The app fails to launch because it can’t find a font that’s only provided through Google Play Services. Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

Users were unable to log in, creators lost their pre-launch efforts, and order numbers were shuffled. Existing campaigns also saw prices increase mid-campaign as exchange rates were recalculated. Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

We previously heard rumors that the device would have a lower-resolution screen, though, and OnePlus has now confirmed this. OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

    "summary": "It's $1,800 for the headset, but the accessories add another $500. What's your view on the price?",
    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new option to prevent Gemini from stopping when you pause to think. Gemini might soon bring a new option to lock the mic so it continues listening until you stop it manually. Google is also testing cosmetic changes to the floating Gemini overlay, as well as the option to move the collapsible Gemini Live button. The digital assistants on our phones may have become more intelligent with the infusion of AI, but one area they still need to improve is their conversational skills. Unless you’re using Gemini Live or ChatGPT’s voice mode, you’re likely to be cut off the moment you pause to think. Fortunately, someone at Google is taking the initiative to fix this limitation in Gemini with an upcoming option that lets you hold uninterrupted chats without relying on Gemini Live.

Several users report that their phones have changed from orange to a rose gold hue, possibly due to solvent use or UV exposure. Apple has quietly replaced affected units. Official response is still pending. The iPhone 17 series is one of Apple’s most successful releases in recent times. Despite the phones being available for over a month now, many models are still routinely out of stock, indicating continued strong demand. Case in point, the new Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max still has a shipping wait time of one to three weeks, depending on the storage variant. The saturated orange color is catching the fancy of many users, but if you have one or are considering buying, you should be aware of the possibility that it may turn rose gold, potentially by accident.

Pixel phones , however, offer no such controls — the AOD is either on or off during the day. Fortunately, Google is working on a new setting that will soon give Pixel users more control over this feature.

    "summary": "The new 2510 Android Canary release brings a brand new UI for the flashlight brightness controls in Quick Settings.",
    "body": "TL;DR A future Android update will add a native flashlight brightness slider to the Quick Settings on Pixel phones. The latest Android Canary release introduces a new visual design for this slider that resembles an actual flashlight. This feature is not expected to launch in a stable release until the Android 16 QPR3 update next March. Most Android phones have rear LEDs that can be used as a flashlight, but not all of them let you natively control the brightness. On Pixel phones , for instance, adjusting the flashlight brightness requires a third-party app. This is a hassle, and many users aren’t even aware such apps exist, leaving them unable to change their flashlight’s intensity. A future Android release will finally let you adjust your Pixel phone’s flashlight strength from Quick Settings . Instead of a simple toggle, the Flashlight tile is being updated to be expandable, revealing a slider to control the flashlight’s intensity. While this slider had a barebones design in the 2508 Android Canary release , Google is now giving it a more striking visual update.",

Samsung hasn’t shared when we should expect the update to resume. Samsung’s in the process of rolling out the Android 16-based One UI 8 across its wide range of compatible phones. The update started hitting the Galaxy S23 just a couple of weeks ago — but now, Samsung has halted that distribution. As reported by SammyGuru , Galaxy S23 phones aren’t currently able to download One UI 8. The S23 series is just the latest to have its One UI 8 rollout stopped: The S24 and S22 series both had the plug pulled on their respective rollouts, too (though SammyGuru says the S22’s update is “partially resumed”).",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google is working on adding a new incognito search mode to its Android app. The feature will work by turning off the history for your current search. This is the equivalent of Google’s incognito mode on its iOS app. There are many ways to perform an incognito search on your Android phone, but Google is working on adding another one that is both more intuitive and easier to remember. The option might have the less obvious name of “History Off Search” instead of a simpler “Incognito” and will appear straight in the main Google app. This will finally allow the Google app on Android to catch up to the iOS app, which has had an incognito mode for many years.
