Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. I can't think of a time when I was solely obsessed with a singular FPS. Even at the height of a 2,000+ hour, multi-year relationship with Rainbow Six Siege, I still regularly played some Call of Duty and Overwatch with friends. That lack of focus probably explains why I was good but never great at Siege, but it's all part of a healthy FPS rotation. That's a thing we all have, right? A handful of shooters we bounce between throughout the year? Maybe you do it for your favorite singleplayer campaigns, or perhaps it's not even a conscious exercise, but it's natural to ebb and flow between familiar shooters that scratch different itches. Earlier this year, I started keeping track of my FPS rotation. I used Backloggd —a journaling site that's basically Letterboxd for games—to make a living list of the shooters I'm always playing, but never at the same time. Right now, my FPS rotation is at 10.

Blevins began his career as a pro gamer, and achieved some success, but was a relatively low-level streamer until 2017/18, when his fondness for Fortnite coincided with the game exploding in popularity. This led to some incredible numbers for Blevins, who became synonymous with the game on Twitch: thanks to team-ups with stars like Drake and Travis Scott, some streams were pulling in just under 700,000 live viewers. He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet…",

During a press conference yesterday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained: \"The two technology teams have been discussing and architecting solutions now for probably coming up to a year, and the two architecture teams—well, it's three architecture teams—are working across, of course, the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for server and PCs.\" Why did we not know about these teams working together for the past few months? Simple, they kept schtum: \"There were no communications with anybody else, except between [Intel CEO] Lip-Bu, myself, and the technical teams that were working on this partnership, and we kept it really quiet.\" The partnership involves a $5 billion buy-in from Nvidia, and is expected to centre mostly around AI but we're hoping there's at least a smidge of gaming goodness to come from it.

Except me: I needed a break from Silksong earlier this week, mostly because I was getting my ass kicked, but also because a small detail on the Adventure of Samsara Steam page piqued my interest. This is actually a spiritual sequel of sorts to the 1980 game Adventure , which was probably the most cryptic and sprawling Atari 2600 cart on the market. Adventure gave me nightmares as a child. Whereas most Atari 2600 games were cheerfully straightforward one-screen arcade games or scrolling shooters, Adventure had designs on being a full-blown, well, adventure, and it displayed some proto-metroidvania qualities to that end.

That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Plus, this is the zombie apocalypse. Of course you should be able to craft a weapon that fires spinning sawblades. (Image credit: Techland) Thing is, the blueprint for the Sawblade Launcher isn't easy to find in Dying Light: The Beast unless you know exactly where to look. It's hidden way, way off in a section of the map you might not explore until late in the game. I was level 9 before I found it (and I finished the game at level 13), so I spent most of the game without it. But the Sawblade Launcher blueprint is in a level 6 area of the map, so you should be able to get your hands on it much earlier than I did.

This follows a weekend patch that didn't seem to do anything to improve things, players jury-rigging various solutions to stop the stuttering , and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford wading into any and all arguments he can find. Borderlands 4 is currently sitting at a \"Mixed\" rating on Steam, and a quick glance shows that nearly every negative review is about performance issues (with some adding \"don't blame the consumer\" for Pitchford's benefit). PCG's Nick Evanson notes that \"every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release\" and this time is no exception. \"We're reading every piece of feedback you share,\" says the Gearbox statement , which makes you feel a little bad for the poor staffer charged with that duty. \"We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming [today]. This is our top priority.\" It adds that a FOV slider option is coming for consoles, and references the Break Free p…",

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy…yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet.

With Techland posting some seriously heavy system requirements and Nvidia partnering once more for RTX and DLSS additions , I was concerned that Dying Light: The Beast would be joining a growing list of recent games that don't run very well on PC. Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs.

The Ryzen 5 7600X3D chip in the OcUK Mach 5R excited me because it feels like a perfect compromise pick. You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play. I was initially worried that games like Borderlands 4, whose official system specs name an eight-core CPU as a minimum , would mean the rig would be bottlenecked. Turns out,…",
