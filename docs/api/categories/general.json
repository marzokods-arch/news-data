This is a Linux-based mobile platform that features BlackBerry 10-inspired features like Active Frames and a Hub inbox. Marathon OS currently runs on the OnePlus 6, with plans to bring it to the OnePlus 6T, POCO F1, and more. BlackBerry 10 may have been a failed rival to Android and iOS, but it was an intriguing and innovative mobile platform in its own right. Now, an enterprising developer has decided to build a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, and it’ll run on Android phones . Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time. Marathon OS even features the BB10 peek gesture, which …",

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better.

Earlier this month, Peach returned with her latest single “Miss Erotica” — a provocative, high-fantasy ode to strip clubs and the showgirls who shaped her early adulthood. Co-written in Los Angeles with Ryan Linvill and Maya Kurchner (Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan), the track marks a bold creative turn for the singer, ushering in what she has described as her most empowered era to date.

Instead, the beloved frontman will take fans behind the scenes of his life and career for An Evening of Storytelling with Mark Hoppus, a spoken-word live tour that promises honesty, humour and vulnerability in equal measure. Hoppus will perform two exclusive shows: one at Melbourne Recital Centre on Thursday, March 19, and another at the iconic Sydney Opera House on Saturday, March 21. The tour follows the release of his 2024 memoir Fahrenheit‑182 , which offered fans an unfiltered look into his childhood, rise to fame with Blink, public cancer battle, and the emotional fallout from band drama and personal loss. Presale access for the Live Nation–promoted event opens Thursday, Nov. 13 at 12 p.m. local time via livenation.com.au/register , with general on-sale beginning Friday, Nov. 14 at 1 p.m. local time. Unlike a typical pop-punk concert packed with Blink classics like “What’s My Age Again?” or “All the Small Things,” this event will trade moshing for meaning.

The OnePlus 15 is set to go international later this week , becoming one of the first devices globally to be powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. In classic OnePlus fashion, official teasers about the device have already been gushing in, confirming notable upgrades for the global variant, including its massive 7,300mAh battery — a 21% upgrade over the OnePlus 13. As OnePlus prepares to launch the OnePlus 15 globally, it has given us access to the device. While we work on a detailed review for you to see soon, we’re bringing you a quick unboxing experience of the OnePlus 15. Additionally, we’re providing a glimpse of the design changes, which align with the Chinese variant launched last month .",

The credit card may offer cashback, which can be redeemed against Samsung products, including phones. In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.

Based on Google Chrome ’s underpinnings, Samsung Internet Beta is a breath of fresh air. It’s 2025, and the odd mandatory mention of AI features is present, but Samsung Internet isn’t an “AI browser” in the same vein as OpenAI’s Atlas or Perplexity’s Comet . It is far more traditional in its philosophy and offers excellent design decisions that improve upon Chrome’s usability, privacy, and multitasking capabilities.",

Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option.

When Typhoon Kalmaegi tore through the Philippines this week, it left catastrophic damage in its wake. Tragically, many lives were lost, entire homes were destroyed, and communities were left to rebuild from scratch. Amidst the devastation, one Reddit user shared an incredible story of their own survival, as well as that of their iPhone, adding to a growing list of phones that have beaten the survival odds recently.
