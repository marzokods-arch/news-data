The phone has a slick design and a well-rounded spec sheet, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip and triple 50MP rear cameras. The Signature also offers seven years of updates and access to exclusive experiences. We first heard about an apparent Motorola Signature phone last month. Fortunately, we didn’t have to wait long for the unveiling, as Motorola has just launched the device. The Motorola Signature is the first phone in the brand’s new Signature series, and it emphasizes a slick design and premium extras. Starting with the design, Moto says the phone is 6.99mm thick and has an aluminum frame. The Signature is available in Pantone Martini Olive with a twill-inspired finish, or Pantone Carbon with a linen-inspired finish. Motorola’s phone also packs Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection and IP68/69 ratings.",
