And, after playing an albeit too brief demo, it definitely reminded me why I love these creatures so much. There isn't much of an introduction to the demo, let alone the characters. So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help. According to them, they'd found a lost dog running about in the snow, but before they …",

Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn , comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a \"co-op party platformer\" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims \"leadership\"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches.

The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

At a glance, the new mouse looks like much the same ambidextrous gaming rodent as the millennial classic. But, predictably, there's plenty of new technology on offer. Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging. Physically, the basic ambidextrous design looks to have been carried over largely untouched. But visible stitching on the buttons betray that it's been, \"enhanced with PU leather-w…",

Much of the report is spent on financial talk: Capcom boasts it's \"achieved 12 consecutive years of increased operating profit\" and \"four decades of steady growth toward our goal of making the most entertaining games in the world.\" Still, it's determined a \"need\" to broaden its output, and has identified the three series I mentioned as high value and worth leveraging with new titles.

It's certainly something to marvel at now, but it hasn't always been like this. Fallout 76's launch has gone down in the videogame annals as something of a car crash . It wasn't helped by the fact that loads of players were incredibly hyped to finally get their hands on a multiplayer Fallout game, only to be stifled by poor performance and missing features. Even before the full release, the beta also had a rough launch with no text chat or FOV slider, and issues with its download. (Image credit: Bethesda) But a lot of time has passed since then—I'm talking about seven years. Now players can enjoy a huge map full of tasks to complete, mutants to kill, and plenty of beautiful places to set up camp. But the game's beginnings haven't been forgotten. \"A big part of live services is achieved through the course of the project,\" Jon Rush, creative director for Fallout 76, tells Ted Litchfield during an interview. \"It's becoming familiar with and accustomed to your player base or your community…",

This was a UI bug—turns out that with the \"move\" widget on a lot of homes, there was a hidden vertical arrow that could still be clicked on. You could also fiddle around with moving another object vertically to trick the game into thinking this was the case (you can see YouTuber DiscordianKitty doing so here).

Gonzalez began by going into some detail on the elements he admired in the show's writing, before things took a rather more interesting turn. \"I really enjoyed the first season of the show,\" says Gonzalez. \"I thought there was some really admirable complexity in the way that they explored the world. I mean, I thought that the Maximus character is a fascinating creation, a fascinating slant to take you into the Brotherhood of Steel. I'm fascinated to see where it goes.\" Gonzalez then makes the dangerous decision to mention the topic of credit and residuals, comparing it to how many early comic book creators were treated: the likes of Bill Finger or Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko. \"It is very odd to see characters that I created showing up in other media,\" says Gonzalez. \"It's also something where there's no credit for that, there's no residuals for that.

Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom.

That includes its film and television studios, HBO and HBO Max and all their properties, the whole of the DC Universe, and of course its remaining game studios. Those game studios are obviously of great interest to us, but for the people at Netflix? I don't want to bruise any egos here but, well, not so much . The Netflix disdain was expressed in an investors Q&A earlier this week, when a caller asked if the WBD acquisition would \"enhance or accelerate\" Netflix's gaming ambitions, which have floundered after a hard-charging start: Netflix has closed or sold off the studios it made such a big point of having just a few years previously, and it's biggest idea these days seems to be laying out huge amounts of money for generative AI . Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters acknowledged that the WBD pickup would be a boon for his company's gaming division, but not to the extent that it …",

As announced on the official CoD blog today , Activision will no longer make back-to-back Call of Duty games in the same series. The news comes off the back of a weaker than usual year for the franchise , which saw the release of Black Ops 7 just a year after Black Ops 6. Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right,\" the blog reads. \"To be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.

While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm.

A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s. For the record, the read IOPS are 550K, the writes 650K. Those are pretty comparable to figures you'd expect from a full M.2 drive with the same two-lane PCIe 4.0 interface. And despite the fact that you can get faster PCIe 4.0 drives with four lanes, let alone even quick…",

Its newer IPs haven't done great, either. Remember Babylon's Fall? You'd better, 'cause it'll only exist in your memories forever . It's almost enough to make me feel sad for a large company (almost—you shouldn't do that) to see it now hit with a 100-slide presentation on its alleged mismanagement from one of its major shareholders. 3D Investment, which holds a 14.36% stake in the company, is now looking to get other shareholders on its side. As shared here by Businesswire (thanks, Automaton ), 3D Investment states that Square Enix has, in the three years since replacing its president , been \"facing the following management issues: (i) a sluggish revenue growth rate and (ii) sluggish profit margins … More recently, SQEX HD recorded massive impairment losses on game development assets, which lack earning power, so SQEX HD is in a very serious situation.\" This is exacerbated by the fact, the shareholder argues, that Square's \"med…",

I've had an adverse reaction to the start of every Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Demon Souls, proclaiming to anyone who'd listen that I'd never touch any of these games again, only to then put hundreds of hours into them. I'm nothing if not consistent. Elden Ring Nightreign was no different in this respect. Dropped into the chaos that is Limveld, I had no idea what was going on or why I had just spawned next to one of the Godskin duo at an evergaol. It was a rough entry into the game, and I hated it, but then I played another round and started to join the dots together. Snap to 200 hours later, and I had beaten all the Nightlords and their Everdark variants, but games were strangely easy. (Image credit: FromSoftware) Well, FromSoft must've heard all my bragging because the latest DLC, Forsaken Hollows, launched last week, and it's rough. I've been repeatedly stomped on by the two new nightlords, the Balancers and Dreglord, whether I'm playing one of the new nightfarers or not. I can't even get past the second night boss sometimes—why is that Demon Prince so angry…",

The Philips Evnia 27M2N5500XD and AOC AGON Pro AGP277QK are both 500 Hz 1440p gaming panels with 1,000 Hz alternative 1080p modes. Size-wise, we're talking 27 inches. The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

    "body": "Horse armor isn't usually a top priority for Minecraft players, but given how strong netherite horse armor is, it's worth looking into at the very least. Netherite horse armor takes a significant amount of work, but it's well worth it. If you're bringing the same horse out each time you adventure, you'll want to keep it safe, and given the fact netherite is the strongest material in the game, it'll more than do the trick. Unlike all other armor, netherite has no durability either, so you know that once you've made it, you probably won't have to again, which is a huge plus for the material. You can also equip it on any adult horse, including zombie horses, which come with their own added perk. So, if you're convinced to give the craft a go, here's how you can make it. How to craft netherite horse armour in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) If you want to get ahold of netherite horse armor in Minecraft, you'll need a set of diamond horse armor first . Take the armor, a netherite ingot, and a netherite upgrade to a smithing table in order to craft the netherite horse armor. When equipped to a horse, this will provide 19 armor points, 3 armor toughness, and 10% knockback resistance. Wh…",
