Remember Blizzard's survival game Odyssey that was canceled after nearly eight years in development? Poof. Gone, tragically leaving behind nothing more than a handful of leaked screenshots. So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go. Back in November, Hypixel Studios CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme said the adventure sandbox ' isn't good yet ', but it already feels pretty good to me.

I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

I've played more than my fair share of cozy life sims, managing everything from farms to convenience stores, but a caravan was a new one that I'd been itching to try. Cozy Caravan launched into early access on Steam last year and just rolled out its 1.0 update this month. It's not the deepest life sim by a long shot, but it's cute and approachable. The rest of my thoughts are down below, but here's a quick pros and 'less pros' chart: ✅ My favorite parts ⚠️ Take note though Adorable animations and chillstep-y tunes Recommends playing with controller Lots of little cooking minigames Stop motion animation can be disabled if it makes you sick Real time market day selling No money management Cute collectathon fetch quests NPC dialogue can be very repetitive (Image credit: 5 Lives Studio) There are four main activities that occupy my time in Cozy Caravan: driving between poi…",

To hold folks over until Season 2's new launch date of February 17, Battlefield 6 will get another mini battle pass free of charge. It's called the Frostfire Bonus Path and includes a weapon package, at least one soldier skin, and a bunch of double XP tokens (the simplest way to pad out a battle pass you didn't plan on having to make). I'm all for devs taking extra time to finish updates instead of slavishly adhering to an arbitrary three-month cycle, especially because Season 1 wasn't exactly great. We got one good map that probably should've been there at launch , one OK map, and a bunch of guns as forgettable and samey as Call of Duty's wall of grey metal.

DLSS 4.5 can draw a ton more power from your graphics card. Nick has been going to town testing DLSS 4.5 since the Nvidia App beta released, running presets across different games and across both an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti , just to see how hefty the performance difference is between the GPU generations. While editing his article I've been scrubbing through the video benchmarks on the page, and while you're not always seeing a huge performance difference in terms of frame rates, you're often seeing a big delta between the power draw of the two DLSS models.

    "body": "Although CES 2026 wasn't the most exciting of the Vegas consumer electronics events of recent years—and heck, with all the big AI talk, there didn't seem to be much 'consumer' about it —there was at least one area of PC gaming hardware to get excited about: monitors. So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG. These do things slightly differently at the sub-pixel level—QD-OLEDs have square red, green,…",

However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas.

Instead, it's because initial batches of the platinum white cables look ever so slightly \"purple\" .

For users who prefer a cleaner and more unified look, we’re happy to provide a replacement set of pure white cables to replace the existing ones and better complement their PC builds.\" Placed side-by-side, the difference is subtle but undeniable.

    "body": "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em! That's both the name of MC Hammer's third studio album and the phrase someone in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check should have said before promoting me to the title of doctor and handing me a large hammer. Unfortunately, they did not, so I am hurting 'em at every opportunity. Quarantine Zone is a first-person medical sim you've probably been seeing clips of for months: it was a huge hit on TikTok following its first demo, and since the full game launched today on Steam you can expect to see a lot more clips, like this one of me carefully examining a guy before clonking him on the head with a hammer. The sim is a bit like Papers, Please without the papers or the please: you inspect survivors of the zombie apocalypse for signs of infection before letting them into the safety a military outpost, while also doing some light resource management around the base and a bit of fairly rote turret defense beyond the walls. You begin with just a flashlight to look for signs of a zombie virus as the survivors stagger in, one by one. Does the subject have red eyes? Weird bruises? A blatantly obvious zombie bite? If they seem a bit sick you can send them to quarantine…",

I am writing this post to inform you, PC gamers who may not have played ingenious puzzle game Blue Prince, about a great deal. It is in no way merely a cover for me to revisit the topic of PC Gamer's official 2025 GOTY vote which I am definitely not still salty about here in 2026. * According to this very website , Blue Prince is the Best Designed game of 2025. True! But that award reflects that it was the runner-up to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which narrowly beat it for the top game of the year prize. To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there. It contains so many layers of mystery and discovery—puzzles you didn't even know were puzzles for 10 or 20 hours, clues that may only make sense …",

    "body": "CD Projekt wrapped up 2025 by selling off GOG , its famously DRM-free digital storefront, to Michal Kiciński , a co-founder of both CD Projekt and GOG. In the years since it launched, GOG has expanded beyond 'good old games' to carry a selection of newer releases, but it remains relatively niche, and has never been a big moneymaker for CD Projekt. But in a new interview with GamesIndustry , Kiciński and GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski said there's room for it to flourish and find success, even in a marketplace so utterly dominated by Steam. The core of the strategy seems simple enough: Throwing hands with Steam is a bad idea, so don't do it. \"Steam is obviously a Goliath,\" said Gołębiewski. \"So for any company to try to tackle Steam is a very hard battle. We've seen Discord launch their store, we've seen Epic Games launch their store—and thanks to the lawsuit with Apple, we know how much it has cost them to launch this battle against Steam. \"So the fact that GOG is expanding, developing, and still kicking, I think it's a testament to the fact that GOG really has its space on the market with its mission of making games live forever.\" Gołębiewski said Steam is \"doing an awe…",
