I'm not sure what's scarier in all honesty: the hauntings or having to work together as a team to figure out the puzzle of what ghost haunts each location.

Compared to the start of 2025, when GPUs were in short supply and prices for many models bordered on the ludicrous, the final quarter of 2025 is a much nicer affair. 👉 The best early Black Friday PC gaming deals right here 👈 Entry-level, budget, and most mainstream graphics cards are generally priced at or below their MSRP, despite import tariffs. It's only the likes of the Radeon RX 9070 XT and GeForce RTX 5090 that remain overpriced. We're expecting new graphics cards from Nvidia in the new year, when it launches the Super variants of its RTX 50-series cards. That means we could see big discounts on RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 cards, as retailers try to clear inventory. We could also see something new from AMD and Intel, but there hasn't been much gossip about these so far. When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 kicks off Friday, 28 November 2028 and runs for three days over the whole weekend.

Mid-range buyers will be well-served by RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti machines, whereas if you've got the cash to splash, even RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 gaming PCs will be dropping in price. Oh, and don't rule out AMD GPUs, either. The RX 9060 XT is an excellent budget gaming graphics card, while the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are very quick mid-range performers.

It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG.

Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing. I think we, in two or three meetings, wrote down, like, three pages of ideas, and it's 'Okay, we need to get this game out quickly, and it needs to be done so it's sold in the US market before Christmas, because we need the money [or] else we cannot pay people.'\" That didn't curb the team's ambitions, mind you. Players had already tinkered with EU1—wherein you selected from a small batch of scenarios, each with a designated playable nation—to make any country accessible from the get. The mod maker behind that feature, named Henrik Fåhraeus, was hired as content designer for the sequel, which aimed to have every country playable in the base game; today, Fåhraeus is Paradox's chief creative officer. \"So, that's a good hire.

    "body": "The progenitor MOBAs—RTS mods like Aeon of Strife and Defense of the Ancients—had something sensational on their hands, but it took awhile for the whole thing to catch on. In 2010, before League of Legends and Dota 2 had become the esports institutions they are now, there was Heroes of Newerth. Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase. If you long to play Dota, it's one of the biggest games on Steam—a platform Reborn is completely forgoing in favor of Juvio. If you're wonde…",

After exploring Arcadia's many moons and space stations, visiting its various merchants and completing quests, I've found some weird ass weapons and armor, including, but not limited to: A gun that fires corrosive tumors you can then eat for health . A hammer with a slot machine built into it that randomly rewards you jackpots. A cowboy hat that boosts damage by 99% if you wait six seconds without shooting anyone in combat. It's a great thing, quite frankly, that The Outer Worlds 2 is leaning so heavily into the absurdity of its setting, trying to provide the kind of weird and wacky build options you'd see in Borderlands 4. Still, the strangest helmet I've come across in my travels through outer space is by far A New Point of View Mk 2. This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest. It's well worth it, though, for its defining feature: it changes the visual style of the game entirely.

It's the best because it has thread titles like \"My son became a German and now my empire is dying\", constant grousing about whatever the Pope's getting up to, and endless hand-rubbing about what to do (or what not to do) with wives, heirs, and all those vassals any self-respecting Crusader King collects. This week's quiz is a simple one. There are 15 thread titles here. To prove your worth, separate the real from the made up.

    "body": "Today EA spilled the beans on Battlefield 6's first major patch arriving October 28, including tweaks to weapon bloom, movement, and the sun. That's all well and good, but I want to know when challenges will be less aggravating. The answer? Not now, but maybe next time. \"We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete,\" today's blog post reads. For those who haven't had the displeasure of grinding challenges required to unlock many gadgets and guns in Battlefield 6, their requirements range from unreasonable, to annoying, to straight up broken. Suppress 300 enemy players? Sounds simple, except the definition of suppression is a moving target (or currently broken). Repair 6,000 vehicle HP in a single round? Yea sure, right after I learn to levitate on command. Land 150 sniper rifle headshots at over 200 meters? Do I look like James McAvoy in critically acclaimed (citation required) 2008 action thriller Wanted to you?

    "body": "This week on Steam's top-played charts, the two new releases going neck-and-neck are Battlefield 6—no surprise there—and a top-down extraction shooter about ducks. Specifically, it's about shooting ducks as a duck. Normally my friend group would be buzzing about the meme game of the week, but it feels like I don't know anyone outside the PCG team who's actually playing Escape From Duckov . Turns out it's mostly popular in China, which is becoming more and more common on Steam—but it's still a total upset of the usual trending game pattern, because Duckov is a singleplayer game with an $18 price tag. (Image credit: Team Soda) Since its launch this week, most of Escape From Duckov's players are in China: You can clearly spot that its player count ( via Steam.db ) spikes in the evenings for China's timezone (about half its peak count happening at 10pm Pacific) and that 64% of its user reviews on Steam are in Chinese. It's not uncommon for games to have a huge audience in a different market, but when Chinese players rocket a new release to the top of the charts it's usually a free-to-play online game. Steam mainstay Naraka Bladepoint still tops 100,000 daily players when China is onli…",
