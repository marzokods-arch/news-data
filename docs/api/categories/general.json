Unlike traditional minimalist wallpapers, Niagara is bringing several new intricately designed illustrations for wallpapers. The update also improves backup features and adds Bing as a search engine option. Niagara Launcher is one of the most distinct Android launchers , and its impact extends beyond its visual characteristics. Having used it for over two years, I can confirm that it alters — in a good way — how you approach the app drawer. I now install it on all the phones I review and strongly recommend it too. However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update. In July, the developers of the launcher introduced a new theme playground , enabling users to experiment with various clock styles, wallpapers, and colors.

This special version of the Gemini model will be used to power the next generation of Siri. This represents Apple’s desperation to enter the AI race, especially with its inability to build a model comparable to Google’s Gemini. Voice assistants from tech brands like Google and Amazon have recently undergone significant enhancements powered by AI.

Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner . Over the weekend, Bloomberg ‘s Mark Gurman reported that with the expected timeline for releasing a revamped Siri drawing closer, Apple has decided to use Gemini to power Siri’s next generation.

These users claim that they have made no changes to their plans. Update: November 5, 2025 (9:20 AM ET): T-Mobile has confirmed to Android Authority that the DashPass by DoorDash offer has not changed, nor is it ending early. We’re told that the company began sending notifications yesterday about benefit eligibility to some customers who made specific account changes. However, some customers received the notification by mistake. T-Mobile adds that it is currently looking into reports where customers received the message in error. Original article: November 4, 2025 (12:09 PM ET): Back in July, T-Mobile began offering a new perk for its customers.

I was surprised by the sheer amount of tech packed into something so tiny, and by the promises of powerful, continuous health tracking from a stylish ring that almost made me feel like I’d stepped into the future. Four months in, that’s where the honeymoon phase ended. The hard realities of current smart ring technology became impossible to ignore. This experience has proven exactly why these wearables will stay a niche product for several years before they can genuinely threaten the reign of smartwatches and established fitness trackers .",

If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

Google is not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring that people not only rely on its AI products but also depend on them in the same way they depend on Search. That is why Google has been pushing Search features like AI Mode and Search Live parallel to Gemini and Gemini Live, offering comparable functionality with and without the benefit of results from Google Search. As you might have guessed, Search Live lets you obtain search results that are fine-tuned in real-time while interacting with it using voice or video.
