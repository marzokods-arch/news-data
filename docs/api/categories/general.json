One of my favourite projects to emerge during this era is Legend of Grimrock , a first-person dungeon crawler that took the fundamentals of games like Dungeon Master and Wizardry and revitalised them for a new generation. If you missed Legend of Grimrock when it launched in 2012, fret not, because both Legend of Grimrock and its sequel are 80% off on Steam this weekend. The original Legend of Grimrock is an unapologetic throwback, taking place within a twisting subterranean complex deep beneath a mountain and crawling with fantasy beasties. You create your own party, bust out of prison and seek to escape the complex, solving puzzles, avoiding traps, and battling foes in turn-based combat as you go. One of my favourite things about Legend of Grimrock is how tactile its dungeon is. You're constantly poking and prodding the world, plucking items off the floor with your mouse to stuff in your inventory, feeling along the walls for hidden switches that m…",

Max technically gets a second appearance as well, since that's him inside the T-60 Power Armor, which gets its own card as well. But it's not all TV tie-ins.

If you'd like more of the latter experience, The Rot Below is probably the mod for you. Impressively, it's the first mod by TheCrowKnight, who says it contains \"A host of terrifying new enemies,\" as well as \"Three boss battles\" and \"over 350 professionally voice acted lines.\" Most of those voice lines presumably belong to the villainous lich Malkifer and a bard named Adabelle you'll be tasked with rescuing, though the credits also include \"The Undead Blacksmith\". The Rot Below also includes new magical items, including glowy enchanted swords, and conjuration spells that let you summon new undead servants. Maybe even some of the mushroom-headed skeletons who appear in the trailer.

It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to.

No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all. Typically, the only heists we cover involve Payday 3 or the latest crypto nonsense ⁠—who the heck steals Pokémon merch at gunpoint?

It seems to be paying off, as developer Moon Studios announced Thursday that the game has moved one million copies on Steam in early access, though it is about to share at least one thing in common with Diablo: 4-player co-op . The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

MMORPGs are monstrously complicated things—they run on huge, easily DDOSable servers, they have economies that can easily get knocked off the rails, are designed to run for decades, and require constant balancing and fine-tuning. If you work on an MMO, you are Sisyphus trying to get a boulder up a hill, except you also have a bunch of angry forum users calling you an idiot the whole way up. Part of my job is understanding these complicated machines, and as I look at games in 2026, I'm starting to notice a trend that's really come to a head in these past few years: The main existential threat to MMORPGs of the modern era is getting the dang difficulty right.

To celebrate his reappearance, Epic is giving away the first two Styx games on Steam. From now until January 22 , both Styx: Master of Shadows and Styx: Shards of Darkness are free to keep on Epic. Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations. Indeed, Cynanide deliver some impressively grand environments that let you take advantage of verticality in fun ways. The seq…",

But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

    "body": "For reasons unbeknownst to mankind, there are a surprising number of applications designed to arbitrarily select and destroy processes on a PC until it crashes. This morning, I was made aware of an application made by user IceSolst on X with AI coding platform Cursor AI that randomly selects a process on your computer via its process ID (PID) and terminates it. If you're wondering why, you're probably overthinking it. From subsequent tweets, it appears a storefront has been added that allows you to buy malware via $hitcoins earned from every spin of the roulette wheel. I wrote Task Unmanager: keeps killing processes Russian Roulette style, until your machine crashes pic.twitter.com/ET0gNDbIxx January 14, 2026 As stupid as it sounds, one can assume that's the whole point. Needless to say, don't install malware on your machine, but this specific application isn't available to download, anyways.

And I wouldn't be surprised if someone from Nvidia also had a not-so-quiet word in Asus' ear last night which 'encouraged' some official clarification today from HQ. The full statement from Asus reads as: \"We would like to clarify recent reports regarding the Asus GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB .
