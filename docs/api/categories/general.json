They join rappers Micah Palace (judge Simon Cowell&#8217;s Live Golden Buzzer) and Mama Duke (Mel B&#8217;s Live Golden Buzzer), dance troupe Team Recycled (Howie Mandel&#8217;s Live Golden Buzzer) and singer-songwriter Steve Ray Ladson (Sofía Vergara&#8217;s Live Golden Buzzer), each of whom bypassed the Semifinals drama. It&#8217;s the end of the line, however, for Bay Melnick Virgolino, Unreal, Birmingham Youth Fellowship Choir, TT Boys and Zak Mirz, who are eliminated at the penultimate stage. For Sanchez, a spot in the final is a dream come true. &#8220;I&#8217;m really stunned, thank you America,&#8221; she told host Terry Crews after her name was called. &#8220;I&#8217;m just so honored to be here&#8230;I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221; Sanchez has imagined this moment for two decades, or…",
