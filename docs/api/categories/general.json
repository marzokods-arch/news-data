    "body": "The 2025 VMAs have wrapped , with Lady Gaga walking away from the USB Arena in Elmont, N.Y., with the most Moon Person trophies this year – four in total . Well, technically Gaga left the arena before winning all four of those VMAs – after all, she had a headlining show to perform at Madison Square Garden – but she was there long enough to collect one in person before jetting off to Manhattan. Hosted by LL COOL J, the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards were one of the best VMAs in recent memory, a smart mix of newcomers who brought their A-game (and inventive visuals) and veterans who demonstrated why they’ve lasted in the game so long. Of the latter category, each one received some sort of Moon Person trophy during the three-hour telecast, with Mariah Carey receiving the Video Vanguard Award, Ricky Martin collecting the Latin Icon Award and Busta Rhymes getting the Rock the Bells Visionary Award. As with any awards show, the awards are important, sure – and based on the deeply personal acceptance speeches from ROSÉ and Ariana Grande, they seem to mean quite a lot – but most viewers are tuning in to see some incredible live music. And this year’s VMAs did not disappoint. We’re running do…",

It&#8217;s led to a lot of confusion in category nomenclature, of course — with the nouns disappearing from categories like &#8220;best pop&#8221; and &#8220;best hip-hop,&#8221; and artists now accepting awards like &#8220;song of the summer&#8221; and &#8220;best album&#8221; that are totally divorced from the music video format. But a much bigger concern for the VMAs than what awards they should be giving out in 2025 is who they&#8217;re putting the show on for the first place: the kids who have been the lifeblood of the channel&#8217;s audience for over 40 years now, or the millennials who actually remember when music videos on MTV still moved the culture.
