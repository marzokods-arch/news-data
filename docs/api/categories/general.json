    "body": "Limp Bizkit are back with their first new song in four years and it is a classic Bizkit banger. “Making Love to Morgan Wallen” bursts out of the gate with a funky wah-wah guitar riff before a marching band beat bubbles up and singer Fred Durst launches into a sung-rap tribute to some fallen rock heroes. “Damn, I miss you Chester/ Sending love from a bass compressor/ Ground control with a soul like Bowie/ And I’ll chop you up if I’m under pressure,” Durst raps in the opening couplet paying homage to late Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington and rock icon David Bowie. From there, if you can believe it — and if you’ve ever listened to a single Bizkit song before, you can — it gets way, way weirder. “Bizkit beats from the pirate band/ Signed this deal with a lobster hand/ Freestyle like a bowling pin/ Flex these bars on a dolphin fin,” Durst raps over the spare backing track. “Life&#8217;s too short, but I can&#8217;t complain/ Doin’ backflips on a candy cane/ Ride my scooter with a cape at night/ And I&#8217;ma high-five me a traffic light.” Naturally.

Dubbed “freak folk” at the time, the genre-bending opus was, in his words, “a snapshot of community,” where Brazilian-inspired tropicalismo, psych-folk and radical inclusivity collided. Recorded in home studios and retreats filled with friendships and free-spirited experimentation, Cripple Crow felt more like a collective effort than a solo project. Its debut at No. 24 on Billboard &#8216;s Independent Albums chart suggested a modest arrival, but its legacy has only grown in the years since. Ahead of its time in both sound and perspective, Cripple Crow brought Banhart’s dual Venezuelan-American heritage into sharp focus, serving as an early example of bilingual experimentation. In an era when U.S. indie music rarely acknowledged deep ties to Latin American traditions, the album broke the mold, drawing inspiration from legends like Venezuela’s Simón Díaz, Argentina’s Mercedes Sosa and Brazil’s Caetano Veloso. Its impact continues to echo in a new wave of bilingual, U.S.-born Latin artists…",

Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others.

Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users. Google has been working to fix that by directly opening up the ability to search for photos from albums shared with you on Google Photos.

From more generous base storage to longer battery life, newer camera tricks, and more, Apple is slowly but steadily narrowing the list of “Android-only” advantages.

The original poster detailed their experience buying the most expensive Pixel out there, not being happy with it, returning it, and buying the Pixel 9a instead, and ending up much more content with the cheaper phone despite their (very tech-savvy) friends’ constant taunting about the 9a’s lower specs and cheaper build quality. That thread hit a chord for me because it’s something I’ve experienced time and again when buying or reviewing phones for Android Authority , as well as when talking about phone purchases with my friends and family. Everyone is just happier with the cheaper phones; it’s anecdotal evidence, sure, but looking for the absolute best Android phone is bound to end in misery and dissatisfaction.",

Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance .

Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles .

This desktop mode provides a taskbar and freeform window management on the external monitor while leaving your phone’s screen free for other tasks. When you connect a mouse, you can seamlessly move the cursor between displays to control both screens with the same peripheral.

It initially launched as a pilot in 2023 and was available to a small number of creators, including MrBeast, Mark Rober, and chef Jamie Oliver. After a two-year stint as a pilot, YouTube is now rolling it out widely over the coming weeks.",

This black color reportedly has a very high light absorption rate, high enough that “the body looks like a black hole.” But what will this color be called? And while on that topic, what other colors will be available on the OnePlus 15? A new leak may have shed some light on those questions. The leak about the “SuperBlack” color came from trusted tipster Digital Chat Station, who is back with another color-related leak. This time, the Weibo user has revealed what could be the official color names for the OnePlus 15. Additionally, they shared how much each SKU could weigh.",

Samsung’s been a leader there, claiming 2,000 cycles for devices like its Galaxy S25 phones. Apple only manages to hit 1,000 cycles, according to its iPhone 17 energy labels. Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles. But how does that compare to the new iPhone 17 family?",

One of the more exciting aspects of the Pixel 10’s launch was the announcement of the new Pixelsnap accessories . These MagSafe-like items can magnetically snap onto the Pixel 10 without the need for a special case.

Although they have only been available for a short amount of time, it appears one Pixelsnap accessory is already running into issues. Spotted by 9to5Google , multiple reports are coming in through Reddit about a problem with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. According to the reports, the issue deals with the screws near the hinge, which keep the metal ring attached to the magnetic panel and provide the resistance to prop the Pixel 10 up. These users claim that the screws are becoming undone.",

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects.

Samsung launched the slim Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, and now Apple has launched the slightly slimmer iPhone Air . We’ve even seen this war extend to foldable phones in 2025. Apple claims the iPhone Air is just 5.6mm thin. However, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge and most other phones, this measurement doesn’t include the camera bump. You only need to look at the picture above to realize that it has a sizeable camera bump. In fact, it might be larger than the S25 Edge’s camera housing.",

A referral code provides a 10% discount on a new Pixel phone for the buyer and gives the referrer a $50 store credit. The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",
