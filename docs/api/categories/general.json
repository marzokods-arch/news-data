But right off the bat in Fallout Season 2, Episode 1, we get to see a location I remember fondly from one of the Fallout games—and surprisingly, it has absolutely nothing to do with New Vegas at all. Thinking about it, this location is probably the place I've spent the most time out of all of the Fallout games I've played. When it showed up in the episode, I immediately got a buffout-sized dose of nostalgia. As the kids say, it hit me right in the feels. (Apologies if the kids no longer say this.) In Episode 1, Lucy and the Ghoul are following Hank's bloody footprints through the desert from California to Nevada, and they discover he made a stop at a location players of Fallout 4 are sure to recognize: the Starlight Drive-In Theatre.

Following Lucy and The Ghouls' journey to find her father and his family, the duo stumbles across tons of iconic Wasteland locations like New Vegas, a fan favourite Fallout 4 spot, Dinky the T. Rex, and one of the most mysterious cut locations from Fallout: New Vegas . I'm of course talking about Vault 24. Over the course of Fallout's life, there have been many iconic Vaults mentioned and featured in games. Many were the childhood homes of our protagonists and player characters—like Lucy's own Vault 33, or Vault 13 from the OG Fallout. But the vaults run the gamut from capsules of Americana to harrowing psychological experiments. Here are just some of the more interesting examples: Vault 4 (TV Show): In season 1, we saw Lucy and Maximus explore Vault 4, the previous home of a group of scientists who experimented with mutants and Wastelanders. Vault 11 (New Vegas): A social experiment took place to see how willing people would be to sacrifice others for the safety of the majority.

The Toddster's appearance or otherwise has been speculated on ever since the show was announced, but Howard says he's more comfortable in the background. The topic came up in a recent interview with IGN , and Howard was pretty clear it's a 'no' from him: \"They've offered me a whole bunch, even in Season 1,\" says Howard. \"I was going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things. I think I'm best behind the camera.” Spoiler alert for Season 1, obviously. This scene is one of the revelations that occurs towards the end of that season, and is a flashback to how Vault-Tec executives and various other business big-hitters divide the various vault experiments between themselves before they agree to drop the bombs. Having Howard in there would've seemed like a pretty neat nod to me, but perhaps an executive from a company owned by Microsoft participating in a corporate carve-up to humanity's detriment would've been too on-the-nose.

It's now after Santa's elves, and if you're willing to help them out they'll shower you with presents and candy canes. Distressed elves seem to spawn at random intervals, but you'll be notified they're out there with an \"elves have appeared around the map\" announcement at the start of a new day. For every elf you save, you get one present with a random item to help with survival and five candy canes . Candy canes serve as event currency, which you can exchange for rewards in the lobby's elf shop. There's a lot to do in the Roblox survival crafting hit's holiday event, but I'm here to explain how to save the elves, spend your candy canes, and every obstacle in between—so put in a good word for me with ol' Saint Nick and get me on the nice list. 99 Nights in the Forest Christmas update details (Image credit: Grandma's Favourite Games / Roblox) Week 1 of the 99 Nights in the Forest Christmas update is live now, but you can expect parts two and three before 2026 rolls in.

It's visually strong and thematically coherent, and a fascinating attempt to explore topics and tones in games that have often been reserved for film, but it struggles to integrate the experience of the player in a way that doesn't distract from its point.

The farm is populated mainly by naked humans wearing horse masks. Bad things happen on the farm.

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024. But it takes a while for those dies to work their way through the system. \"This Nvidia RTX 3060 series has been sold for a long time. Although Nvidia stopped producing this GPU a while ago, board partners still had remaining inventory on hand,\" Board Channels says. \"Brands such as Colorful, Taiwanese vendors, and Galax mostly cleared their inventory around September or October. After that, only Zotac still had the largest RTX 3060 stock on hand, and it was fully cleared during November.

    "body": "When a developer announces the follow-up to one of PC Gamer's highest rated games of all time , you can bet that we'll have questions—too many to fit into the few minutes we had to interview Larian after The Game Awards last week. While the developer is keeping most of its next game, Divinity , secret for now, we still pried loose a few details about Larian's \"biggest most ambitious RPG yet,\" including the style of combat, broad technical advancements, and how representative that wildly dark and violent reveal trailer is of the game as a whole. Don't get your hopes up about a release date, though—Larian isn't throwing any days, months, or even years out yet. But if you were worried that cinematic teaser meant Divinity was just starting pre-production, we've got some good news. Read on for a quick overview of the key things we learned straight from Larian. 1. Yes, Divinity is still turn-based, but it's not recycling Original Sin 2's combat Elemental effects could get out of hand (in a good way) in Original Sin 2's combat, and we suspect we'll see more of that.

    "body": "Welcome to PC Gamer's annual Game of the Year awards. Below you'll find our picks for the best PC games released these last 12 months, along with our overall Game of the Year for 2025. Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout. Let us know in the comments which games you've loved the most this year.

Larian knows that's what people now expect from its RPGs, and it's already bringing actors into the studio to work on Divinity . \"We're still casting, but we already have a bunch of actors in,\" studio founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer in an interview after The Game Awards , where Divinity was revealed. Unlike a film that's written first and then shot, Larian's creative process entails capturing its actors' performances as soon as development is out of pre-production. \"This gives you an idea of the ambition,\" he said. \"We built a huge studio in Guilford, with six recording studios in there. The idea is that these are going to be recording nonstop on this game, which gives you an idea of the ambition. It's big, because we want you to have lots and lots and lots of choice.

    "body": "I was worried about Fallout Season 2. The dud second season is a cliché in TV just like it is in sport—the sophomore slump where a show loses its spark. Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

Wonder no more: in a post-TGA interview with PC Gamer, Larian boss Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based RPG, and elaborated a bit on what we can expect from its combat and systems. \"It's not a clone of D:OS 2 in that sense, it's a new ruleset, a ruleset built on everything that we learned from all the previous games that we've done,\" said Vincke. \"I think you're gonna enjoy it. It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

We previously reported that Lenovo and HP had already warned customers of upcoming price hikes , while Dell will implement price increases of up to 30% as soon as December 17, according to Business Insider . Now, Commercial Times reports that both Acer CEO Jason Chen and Asus co-CEO Samson Hu have expressed that there is an industry-wide consensus that pricing will reflect spiking memory costs (via TrendForce ). Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%. While that's not a huge increase, Chen explained that some manufacturers may try to balance costs by lowering specs. Fo…",
