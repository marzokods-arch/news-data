This isn’t the first time the Puerto Rican reggaetón icon has ventured into merengue. Just last June, he released “Cora Roto,” a collaboration with Elvis Crespo. — SIGAL RATNER-ARIAS Grupo Firme &amp; Lenin Ramírez, &#8220;Ctrl + Z&#8221; (Music VIP Entertainment/DEL Records) Accompanied by a traditional Sinaloan band, Grupo Firme and Lenin Ramírez make the tuba and trumpets sound even louder with their powerful vocals on this heart…",

Between March 7 and Jun. 16, 2025, NASA worked with crowdsourcing company Freelancer to seek design ideas from global creators for a zero gravity indicator that will fly aboard the agency’s Artemis II test flight. Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space.
