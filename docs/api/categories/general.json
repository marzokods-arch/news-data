    "body": "“Truly a dream come true,” said host Nikki Glaser at the top of her monologue, and it has been a dreamy few years for the stand-up comedian. According to Billboard Boxscore, she is the No. 5 top grossing woman comic of the 2020s to date, with $13.8 million in box-office receipts for 252,000 tickets sold over 171 shows. A veteran comedy roast master, she was one of the stars of Netflix’s 2024 flambé of NFL legend Tom Brady and then killed as the host of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, which got her invited back for next year’s ceremony.&nbsp; She also killed during that monologue — “Here I am in New York City, [Jeffrey] Epstein’s original island” — so it was a little disappointing to see her relegated to straight woman roles in most of the sketches. Still, the sketches were solid, Sarah Sherman got more screen time (yay!), musical guest Sombr’s performances were impressive, and Brad and His Dad, a Leigh McG animated short written by Streeter Seidell and cast member Mikey Day , was funny and touching in a King of the Hill kinda way. Plus we got a Pete Davidson cameo on Weekend Update, where he talked about his and Colin Jost’ s purchase of a decommissioned Staten Island Ferry, and his…",

    "body": "The first quarter of the 21st century featured 327 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits seemingly covering every topic imaginable. Chart-toppers in that span ranged from “We Belong Together” to “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” From “Bootylicious” to “Way 2 Sexy,” “Angel” to “Vampire.” “Butterfly” and “Fireflies” both winged their way to No. 1. So did such explosive hits such as as “Firework” and (directly after) “Grenade.” For every “Party Rock Anthem,” there was “A Bar Song” to sing along to (probably loudly if while tipsy). Meanwhile, no matter where music fans were, or any loyalties, we bopped to “Empire State of Mind” and “California Gurls” and everything in between. The creators of those hits encompass nearly 1,000 credited songwriters (along with more than 300 producers). Some double as superstar recording artists, while others have made their mark on pop culture as behind-the-scenes musical masterminds.

For those new here, Billboard teamed up with DJ Monitor, a service that installs music-recognition technology for venues and festivals, along with a contribution from the Coalition DJs, to collect data from the three Atlanta-based strip clubs. Metro Boomin&#8217;s A Futuristic Summa dominance continued into the fall as Young Metro has been a staple on our strip club chart for its first three months, where he once again holds the top two slots.

Operating profit, which measures a company&#8217;s total core business earnings after interest and tax are taken out, fell to a loss of 42.2 billion Korean won (negative $30 million) in the quarter, reflecting higher income taxes and pressure on HYBE&#8217;s recorded music business, which fell 11.5% from last year due to fewer new album releases. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were negative 16.8 billion Korean won (about $12 million) for the quarter.
