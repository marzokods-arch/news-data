And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make. It's not exploding on Steam like Arc Raiders, but it's been quietly hovering around 8,000 concurrent players, which is a pretty healthy amount for something that hasn't been fully released yet.

How about more 2D pixel art, but this time in first person ? \"Turbo wildcard\" Vampire Crawlers, a spin-off coming next year, reinterprets the characters, enemies and items of Vampire Survivors into a deckbuilding dungeon crawler. \"It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer,\" Poncle founder Luca told Xbox Wire in an interview ahead of the announcement. Shortly after the success of Vampire Survivors, Luca \"was already thinking of getting in touch with other indie studios to start working on spin-offs,\" so the idea behind Vampire Crawlers has been gestating for about four years. He suggests it's just one of many prototypes they've had in development, but the marriage of Vampire Survivors' spiraling chaos and a first-person roguelike just worked immediately. \"To some people this game will look like a 'blobber', a half-unknown genre that us…",

MrBeast, or Jimmy Donaldson, revealed the scope of attractions in Beast Land (and the game-oriented in-park land Beast Zone) earlier this month in a thread on X . The games on offer include Drop Zone, where players aim to be the last person standing atop a series of trap doors, and Airmail, where players drop a \"weighted bag\" from a zipline onto a target below. As reported by Kotaku , the park also features thrill rides, photo-op set pieces where you can pretend to hold Feastables with MrBeast himself, a seemingly endless spew of branded merchandise, and a stash of 1 million Saudi Riyal, or roughly $266,000 USD, which will go to the highest scoring Arena players.

Blizzard has never explicitly stated it was intentional, but fans have assumed it cycled through the roles to keep the number of heroes in each role balanced. Overwatch has always had significantly more damage heroes than the rest, but everyone accepted that as a consequence of it being the most popular role. The hero release pattern isn't a hard rule, Blizzard tells PC Gamer in a recent interview. And that's why its next hero, Vendetta , isn't a tank as many players expected. She'll be the game's first purely melee-based damage hero, a fantasy that the developers couldn't pass up. \"I saw a lot of very confident expectations that hero 45 was going to be a tank based off of a recent release pattern that we're now switching up a little bit,\" senior character artist Bryan Bedford says. \"But I think one of the most important aspects of adding a new hero is honestly just coming up with something that's fun to play.\" Associate gam…",

The latest plea for official Proton support started on Reddit , where Scout339v2 shared their screenshot of Rust running \"on a server with EAC disabled to show that the game already works perfectly on Linux.\" Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is the key factor here, and part of a broader conversation where Facepunch and its Linux/Proton userbase don't see eye-to-eye. While it's true Rust runs on Proton, you can't join official servers, and most unofficial servers, with EAC disabled. Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support.

    "body": "Before Dispatch came out, I was pretty confident that the era of the Telltale-style game was in the past; we had a bit of a golden age there, sure, what with The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, and the shockingly good Tales From the Borderlands . But after Telltale's wobble and the shockingly-less-good New Tales From the Borderlands , I figured they'd gone the way of the dodo. I was super wrong. Dispatch, per AdHocStudio's Bluesky account , has hit two million players: \"We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the two million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.\" We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the 2 million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.Art by Derek Stratton. — @adhocstudio.com ( @adhocstudio.com.bsky.social ) 2025-11-20T11:33:01.012Z That comes fresh on the heels of the fact that Dispatch hit its 3-year sales target in just as many months . All in all, AdHoc and Critical Role have shot a dose of adrenaline back into the genre, and I'm here to use my divine powers of gamer understanding to tell you why: It's, uh, it's pretty good. Okay, in seriousness, Dis…",

    "body": "After its collaboration with Infinity Nikki , I thought it would be a while before Stardew Valley jumped into another random game for an elusive partnership. But, to my surprise, we've left the planet for a more galactic adventure this time around, though it won't be the farm life we're used to. That's right, Stardew Valley has teamed up with Among Us to bring a bundle of 29 themed cosmetics for your little avatar, so you no longer have to rely on the sprout hat. This package includes things like a Krobus and Junimo Pet, a Mayor Lewis outfit, and a Linius outfit, among many others which will let you cosplay as Abigail, Sebastian, and Mr Qi. No matter how rogue your favourite character is in Stardew, it seems Among Us have tried to create an outfit for everyone in their Cosmicube. For those who don't know what that means, a Cosmicube is basically a bundle of themed cosmetics which you can buy for in-game currency, which in this case is Beans. So there's no need to spend the day growing crops and fishing to be able to afford this one. You'll be able to spend your hard-earned cash as either an imposter or a crewmate, the only catch is you need to play these games to completion rather…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. If I were to show you a tiny sliver of a screenshot from a game like Counter-Strike or Minecraft or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you could probably identify it easily, even without context. The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.) Remember, not every letter I show you is the first letter of the game name! And B sure to let us know how U scored in the comments, K?",

Check the subreddit or the Steam forums and you'll see threads of befuddled players with titles like \"Goose??\" and \"please be careful around geese\" and \"throw every goose you see.\" Where Winds Meet isn't really a game about killing wildlife, but like the chickens in Zelda games, these geese pack a punch. Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it. For whatever reason, geese can drown in the world of Where Winds Meet. They won't even attempt to escape as they slowly take damage and fa…",
