    "body": "Peso Pluma (real name Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija) and Tito Double P (real name Jesús Roberto Laija) might have been second cousins, but they never actually met in their native Mexico until Peso moved to Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa in Northwestern Mexico. There, at a party, the 18-year-old Peso met his 20-year old cousin Tito for the first time. Both were aspiring musicians, but Peso already came with a sound and a style: he sang the corridos tumbados that were beginning to make the rounds with the likes of Natanael Cano and Junior H, about lifestyle and drugs, a far cry from the “corridos de hombres” about heroes and anti-heroes that most Mexicans had grown up with. Even then, his nasal, piercing vocals struck a chord. And, more than anything, says Tito, so did his energy. “I made music as a hobby then,&#8221; says Tito today. “And from the moment he arrived, I said, come here. I&#8217;ll write, you sing.&#8221; It was the beginning of a musical partnership and a close friendship that first propelled Peso to super-stardom (with Tito co-writing many of his biggest hits) and more recently, Tito. The cousins ended 2025 at No. 4 (Tito) and No. 5 (Peso) on Billboard’s year-end To…",

    "body": "In late 2015, Ariana Grande &#8216;s seemingly frictionless ascendance to all-consuming pop superstardom had finally hit a tiny bit of turbulence. &#8220;Donutgate&#8221; and other small-scale controversies had put her in the media&#8217;s crossfire for the first time, while &#8220;Focus&#8221; — the planned lead single off her upcoming third album, then to be titled Moonlight — had disappointed commercially and left fans a little cold. It was nothing she couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t bounce back from, but in the meantime, she dropped a surprise release to celebrate the holiday season, and give both her sound and her career a little bit of a reset: the six-song EP Christmas &amp; Chill . On this week’s Great Moments in Pop Star History episode of the Greatest Pop Stars podcast , host Andrew Unterberger is joined by Billboard staff writer and longtime Arianator Kyle Denis to look back at 10 years of Christmas &amp; Chill . We remember the Ariana Grande holiday releases that preceded it — including a song that&#8217;s already well on its way to being an all-time seasonal standard — and then dive into why Chill has come to hold a particularly special place in the hearts of fans a…",
