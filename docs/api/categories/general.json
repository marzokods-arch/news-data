From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room .

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected.

While I could treat myself to a funky, chunky, mains-powered USB hub, I'm kind of longing for something just a little dinkier—and flexible. Enter the DockFrame , a USB-C hub with modular ports you can swap out. Though not officially affiliated, the project is designed to work with the hot-swappable hardware standard used by Framework's expansion cards . A custom PCB is both compatible with any Framework USB-C modules you may have lying around as well as the DockFrame's own 'Tool Cards.'

    "body": "When Xgimi released the MoGo 4 Laser projector, a little light switched on in my brain. Three, actually. This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit. That's what Xgimi is pandering to with the MoGo 4 Laser: tech fiends with a penchant for adaptable equipment. At any moment, a swift attachment of one of the…",

VR headsets are becoming fairly popular, but the dream of putting on a headset and seamlessly teleporting to an immerse new world, while my lounge room fades away, is yet to be realised. While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later. You’re also beholden to Pimax’s software, which acts as a driver hub and is required to be configured to play some games li…",

Every feature built twice. Every bug fixed in two places. Every conversation about 'which one should I use' was a reminder that we were competing with ourselves instead of solving the actual problems in front of us.\" The short and the tall of it is that \"We're stopping development on the Nexus Mods App and focusing all our efforts on Vortex.\" Which, sure, makes sense.

It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it. MMOs with both crossplay and cross-progression are exceedingly rare compared to their PC-exclusive or otherwise cordoned-off counterparts, and given what sort of trouble arises squeezing all those players together on a single platform, it's no surprise this sort of thing takes a lot of extra work.

Below, I'll outline where you can find sturdy chitin in Hytale, so you're not wandering aimlessly through the zones. I hope you like bugs because, I'll warn you now, the enemies you need to hunt down are truly horrifying. How to get sturdy chitin in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) You can get sturdy chitin from killing the following mobs in the Howling Sands zone , which is the desert biome: Scarak Defender, Fighter, Louse, Seeker, and Broodmother Scorpions Armadillos Tortoises Given that the relatively harmless mobs on the surface, like tortoise, only give one or two sturdy chitin each, your best bet is hunting down Scarak mobs, especially inside their underground nests. While exploring caves in the Howling Sands, keep an eye out for grey/brown spotty blocks, as these indicate a Scarak nest. …",

At one point, Bezos recalls a time when he was in Luxembourg, visiting a brewery. \"This trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS (Amazon Web Services, founded 2002), and the brewery was 300 years old. This company [had been] making beer for 300 years … they had a museum, and in that museum was an electric power generator, 100 years old. \"When they wanted to improve the efficiency of their brewery with electricity, there was no power grid, so they had to build their own power station … they made their own electricity, and at that time, that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity: they had their own electric generator.\" Why was he rambling on …",

Depending on when you're reading this, it might've done it already, given the patch launches on January 20. Alright, \"kneecap\" is harsh. Blizzard's made an effort through rounds of beta testing, and continual conversations with addon developers, to try and thread the needle between functionality and form. Basically, the developer doesn't want addons to be required—but anything that's cosmetic can stay . This means obvious things, like roleplay, map, and bag addons are all fine; It also means there's wiggle room in the combat addon sphere for presentation, which is nice for customisability, but it also means that certain accessibility features made by addon creators over the years can be maintained. Or so, Blizzard hopes. This also involves a lot of class redesign.

    "body": "Sometimes in Skyrim you wander into a hole in the ground, fight some draugr, defeat a dragon priest, collect a shout, and leave via an exit that conveniently loops you back to where you came in. Sometimes you end up in a gloaming fungal underworld and only emerge hours later barely remembering what the surface looks like. If you'd like more of the latter experience, The Rot Below is probably the mod for you. Impressively, it's the first mod by TheCrowKnight, who says it contains \"A host of terrifying new enemies,\" as well as \"Three boss battles\" and \"over 350 professionally voice acted lines.\" Most of those voice lines presumably belong to the villainous lich Malkifer and a bard named Adabelle you'll be tasked with rescuing, though the credits also include \"The Undead Blacksmith\". The Rot Below also includes new magical items, including glowy enchanted swords, and conjuration spells that let you summon new undead servants. Maybe even some of the mushroom-headed skeletons who appear in the trailer. There's new music too, so if like me you muted Skyrim's repetitive score a hundred hours ago, maybe turn the volume back up for this one. You can download The Rot Below from Nexus Mods. …",

    "body": "Hytale is finally playable after a legendary run through development hell , and it's doing pretty well for itself, considering. It's made a pretty penny already, enough to fund two years of further development, and crucially, it's actually good . PC Gamer senior editor Christopher Livingston said in his impressions that the game \"has a long road ahead\" but \"what's here and working works well.\" The Hytale Team seems keen to keep the momentum up, as just four days after release, players have already been treated to a sizable update . It kicks off with a patch note containing the two most beautiful words in the English language: \"added dinosaurs.\" It's a good sign that the team has its priorities straight. But that's not all. There are some new character creation options, a slew of bug fixes including several crash fixes, and some balance changes addressing some fundamental-sounding problems: \"weapon attacks should now check for line of sight,\" for example. Some placeholder assets and animations have been traded for more polished ones, and \"cautious wildlife predators\" have been adjusted so that they don't attack you unless you give them a reason to. You can find the full patch notes…",

    "body": "Pokémon games may not come to PC very often, but it's still the highest-grossing media franchise in the world and, therefore, serious business. Serious enough to pull a gun in the middle of a store, apparently, as NBC reported happening during a robbery in Manhattan on January 14. No one was hurt, fortunately, but the trio of robbers brandished handguns and smashed open several display cases full of merchandise at the Poké Court on 13th Street. They stole what store owner Courtney Chin estimates is $100,000 in merchandise. The thieves remain at large. Now, I know what you're thinking. This crime, though unfortunate, is sort of novel and maybe even a little funny because a Pokémon store was robbed and not a bank or an art museum. That's why you're reading it on PC Gamer, after all. Typically, the only heists we cover involve Payday 3 or the latest crypto nonsense ⁠—who the heck steals Pokémon merch at gunpoint? But a brief trip down the rabbit hole informed me that this Pokéheist is embarrassingly mundane. Earlier this month , a similar robbery in Los Angeles involving the creature collector netted some armed thieves triple the payday of the above case. The same weekend, another ro…",
