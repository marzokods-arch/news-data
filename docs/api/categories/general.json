I’ve used it to back up my photos longer than any social media app has, and I expect to do so until Google lets the app live. Besides automatically generated memories, you can also revisit memories by creating collages within the Photos app. But if you use the built-in Collage Editor in Photos, you might find it limiting compared to other third-party apps. Thankfully, Google is now testing new features that let you tweak collages to your taste and keep you from having to look for alternatives .

MANGMI is less than a day away from launching the cheapest 7-inch gaming handheld on the market, the Pocket Max , but the deal just became a little sweeter. Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

The Grammy winner recently went under the knife after a scan revealed stage one lung cancer. The operation was deemed a success, but he needs more time out. “I’m doing great and recovering very well after my surgery,” he writes. “I’ve been getting exercise and spending some time in the studio, which has been fantastic.” With some additional downtime, he continues, “I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that’s kicking off at the end of February. Having a few extra weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!” View this post on Instagram No replacement dates have been announced for the postponed Vegas shows, and tickets will be refunded at the point of purchase, reps say.

It’s not yet clear if this game would be a mobile version of Heardle, or something all new. Who among us doesn’t take a bit of pride in their musical taste? Maybe you’re the one in the friend group who’s always sharing their latest playlist, or is first in line to brag about their Spotify Wrapped achievements.

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears.

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

It topped charts, with average peak speeds of 260Mbps overall and 310Mbps on 5G, while Verizon could only achieve 130Mbps. T-Mobile also ranked first in consistency and reliability, as per the report. Ookla, the company behind the iconic Speedtest.net, has released fresh insights about the leading carriers in the US based on their network speeds. According to this report, T-Mobile has emerged as the top service provider for the second half of 2025, with the highest download speeds. It repeats this feat after being established as the fastest carrier in the first half of 2025 as well. This report, according to Ookla, is based on speed tests performed by millions of users across the US. According to Ookla’s findings, T-Mobile’s average network speed stood at roughly 260Mbps, while its average 5G speed was nearly 310Mbps. Verizon, on the other hand, only recorded an average top speed of about 130Mbps, less than half of T-Mobile’s.",

The technology could debut on the OPPO Find X10 series and the photography-focused HUAWEI Nova 16 series, scheduled for launch later this year or early next year. A square sensor allows users to take landscape or portrait selfies without physically rotating the phone by cropping into the sensor. One of the most underrated upgrades on the iPhone 17 series is the new 18MP “Center Stage” front camera. While the camera itself is great, the party trick is that it uses a square sensor. This allows users to take selfies in landscape and portrait orientations without physically rotating their phone, as the company crops into the sensor for the shot. Android users could soon join in on the fun, as Android brands have started exploring a square selfie camera for their upcoming phones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Nothing is reportedly about to break the premium-only mold it set with the Headphone 1 . After turning heads with its transparent-design over-ears and solid feature set last year, the brand is now said to be readying a more affordable sibling, and the pricing could surprise you. A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",
