    "body": "With two nominations, Ninajirachi could seriously cash in at the first-ever New South Wales Music Prize, the finalists for which were unveiled on Monday, Oct. 27. The Central Coast-raised artist, DJ and producer’s 2024 girl EDM collection is shortlisted for the main prize, the most lucrative in the Australian music industry which carries with it a A$80,000 ($52,000) winner’s check. Ninajirachi is also a chance for NSW breakthrough artist of the year, with a A$40,000 ($26,000) cash prize. The 26-year-old’s star is on the rise. With eight nominations at next month’s ARIA Awards, Ninajirachi (real name: Nina Wilson) is the leader of the pack. Separately, her debut full length album I Love My Computer (via NLV Records) is one of nine titles shortlisted for the coveted 2025 Australian Music Prize , awarded each year to the outstanding Australian album of original work from the previous year, judged by a music industry panel. And in August, the month I Love My Computer dropped, she was named as Billboard&#8217;s dance rookie of the month. Other two-time NSW Music Prize nominees include 3% ( Kill the Dead ), BARKAA ( Big Tidda ), Shady Nasty ( Trek ) and SPEED ( Only One Mode ), while th…",

    "body": "Since Pinkpantheress first snuck into cool kids&#8217; playlists with 2021&#8217;s &#8220;Break It Off&#8221; — and truly exploded into the world of mainstream pop with 2023&#8217;s Ice Spice-assisted &#8220;Boy&#8217;s a Liar, Pt. 2&#8221; — the British singer-songwriter has consistently offered an incisive reflection of Gen Z&#8217;s Internet-driven, hyper-self-aware, irony-anchored humor and culture. Her bite-sized tracks helped her become one of TikTok&#8217;s earliest favorites, but her witty, honest lyricism and infectious self-produced records that blend drum and bass, garage, and alternative pop helped her transcend the volatile social media app. On Friday night (Oct. 24), just a week after dropping her inventive Fancy Some More remix project, Pinkpantheress delivered the strongest, most fully-realized show of her career at the launch of the North American leg of her An Evening With&#8230; Pinkpantheress Tour. Kicking off her two-night residency at Brooklyn&#8217;s Kings Theatre with &#8220;Stateside,&#8221; Pinkpantheress spent her set hitting all of her marks across a tri-staired platform flanked by her hilarious DJ on one end and her terrific drummer on the other.

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 43-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week.
