This new EP can be seen as an expression of their maturity into adulthood and the changes they&#8217;ve undergone. On the album, the four express how they&#8217;ve changed, the energy they give off, their indelible memories, the messages they want to convey, and so much more, with an honest and unflinching approach that shows just how strong the band truly is.

Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",

A surprising report last month claimed that OnePlus may be winding down its smartphone operation, and we polled you on your feelings about it in our coverage. OnePlus has since dismissed the report as false, so it might be nothing, but my colleague Joe Maring argued that losing OnePlus would be bad for Android and the US smartphone industry as a whole.

Google is therefore continuing to drop new features in Gemini to entice users, and is now testing three new features. But in addition to adding new features for users, Google may also be looking to simply replace another chatbot with Gemini. Out of the features Google is currently testing in Gemini, the most compelling appears to be the ability to import chats from other AI chatbots while retaining all information and media shared in those chats. Alexey Shabanov of TestingCatalog has discovered a new “Import AI Chats” option in Gemini’s attachment menu. As expected, this solution is geared towards helping users switch from competing platforms, such as ChatGPT , Claude, or Microsoft Copilot.",

For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1.

The most buzzworthy is the iPhone Fold , which is expected to debut alongside the iPhone 18 later at Apple’s yearly September event. Much before its launch, the iPhone Fold is already shaping trends with its unusual “wider” aspect ratio and driving Android brands to adopt the same . Apple’s next foldable, however, could be far more conventional. While the first Apple foldable has yet to hit the shelves, the industry is buzzing with speculation about the second.

The device runs Android 14 and supports stylus input, an optional keyboard, and 4G LTE connectivity. Pre-orders are live now, with pricing starting at $699 and shipping expected mid-February. As color E-Ink tablets edge closer to traditional tablets, Bigme has officially announced the B10. The generously sized device is positioned as a productivity-first tablet for reading, writing, and, with an optional keyboard, light work. The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools. The device also supports varied text input, with stylus support for handwriting and sketching, plus an optional magnetic keyboard case. The latter nudges the B10 toward lightweight laptop territory.",

The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

It’s not the latest silicon or a Snapdragon chip, but it should still deliver decent gaming performance. The sliding gaming phone is still heading to Kickstarter, though the campaign hasn’t launched yet. AYANEO’s first gaming phone has been a little quieter than expected lately, partly due to the company’s recent service improvement roadmap and the decision to pause its crowdfunding plans . But we have a concrete update on the Pocket PLAY that clears up one of the biggest open questions about performance. In a new post on X , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket PLAY will be powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 chipset. It’s a familiar flagship chip — albeit dating back to 2023 — and should be a solid pick, even if it’s not the latest silicon or the Snapdragon chip some fans may have been hoping for.",

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify is working on making usernames editable. The music streaming platform technically already has usernames, but they are not at all user-friendly, and haven’t been for years. Currently, Spotify accounts receive automatically generated alphanumeric usernames, but users might soon be able to customize these. Spotify has been steadily transforming from a pure music-streaming service into a social media platform. Last year, the company introduced in-app Messages, and just yesterday, it quietly expanded that feature with group messaging support. Now, we’ve discovered evidence in the latest Spotify app that suggests the company may be preparing another long-requested upgrade: editable usernames.",

The image confirms that the next Galaxy Unpacked event will happen on February 25, where Samsung is expected to debut its new flagships and the Galaxy Buds 4 lineup. The Galaxy S26 series is rumored to go on open sale closer to mid-March. The first month of the year is almost out, with no official announcement from Samsung about its next set of flagship phones. While the company has confirmed they’ll arrive in the first half of the year, and many of you likely already have a good idea of when, that familiar pre-launch hype has yet to kick in. All we have till now is a teaser for the upcoming Privacy Display feature the company is cooking up for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Now, trusted leaker Evan Blass has shared what appears to be an official Samsung teaser with the launch date printed front and center.",

The change introduces a new “geofenced variable power” category, allowing higher power and outdoor use under specific conditions. While little will change overnight, the decision could improve future Wi-Fi performance for your phone, smart home gear, and more. Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).

A much larger cover screen is also said to be coming, while the inner screen could grow to 7.5 inches. The camera setup could get its own dedicated space instead of sharing it with the outer display like before. HUAWEI’s follow-up to one of the most unconventional flip phones of recent years seems poised to push its weird-but-wonderful design even further. A new leak suggests the HUAWEI Pura X2 would be a rethink of the form, especially how you interact with it before and after unfolding. When HUAWEI launched the first Pura X in 2025, it stood out by offering a wide 16:10 inner display instead of the usual tall, narrow screen. This made reading, browsing, and multitasking feel more natural, even if video playback left black bars.",
