    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has apparently developed its own GPU architecture and plans to use it in the Exynos 2800 processor. This chipset could potentially be used in some Galaxy S28 models in 2028. It’s believed that this custom GPU tech would enable improved local AI capabilities and better software optimization. Samsung’s high-end Exynos processors have GPUs based on AMD’s architecture. This technology is derived from AMD’s PC hardware, bringing good graphical performance and ray tracing tech to Exynos-powered Samsung phones . We previously heard rumors that Samsung could be designing its own GPU without AMD, and we now have more apparent details. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR A lot of users are complaining that they don’t see the option to make their Google Photos 2025 recap. Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

    "body": "Galaxy Z Fold 4 Credit: Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is rumored to revive S Pen support for the Galaxy Fold. Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

Yesterday was Day 8, and the group put out another three-plus hours of livestream, continuing the tiring endeavor of folding and unfolding the phone repeatedly. And while my nonextant grasp of the Korean language prevents me from understanding the banter, watching them go on is definitely satisfying.

Pricing is set to start at $419, with crowdfunding beginning “soon.” Anybody can make a tablet, but as we’ve learned in the years since this form factor really took off, not everybody wants just a giant phone. Some manufacturers have sought to differentiate their offerings with an emphasis on screen quality — instead of a blaringly bright, glossy, laptop-like display, something more eye-friendly and pleasing to the touch. That’s just what TCL has been pursuing with its NXTPAPER tech, and now the company is getting ready to introduce its latest tablet based on one of these panels.

Yout is an online utility that lets users download copies of videos from various sources, including YouTube. Founder John Nader insists that the service Yout offers doesn’t break the law — but a Brazilian criminal court disagrees.

Update, December 22, 2025 (2:12 PM ET): Sure enough, those “appliance” vibes we were getting from the teaser video appear to be spot on. Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",

The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",
