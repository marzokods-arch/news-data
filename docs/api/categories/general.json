Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire.

The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

In short, Zeekerss is highly prolific, which makes it all the stranger that his latest game has been in development for longer than any of the above. Welcome to the Dark Place is a creepy single-player text adventure inspired by the likes of Zork and Kentucky Route Zero , which Zeekerss' has been working on for more than a decade. Speaking to GamesRadar , Zeekerss revealed why Welcome to the Dark Place had taken him so long to develop. Counterintuitively, it has to do with how easy text adventures are to make (or at least, to iterate ideas in). \"The strength of the text-based genre is that its scope isn't limited by the need to make 3D models and textures and mechanics,\" Zeekerss explained. This meant Zeekerss could implement his ideas very quickly. \"As soon as I think of something, it can be playable.\" But t…",

Most of REPO's existing critters are unsettling, especially the Upscream and the Animal, but there's nothing that really petrifies you. The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch. However, one of REPO's newest addition…",

You won't see any drug dealers dressed up as werewolves or vampires while engaged in their own highly illegal game of Trick or Treat (The treat is drugs. The trick? Gun.)

But it seems this wasn't enough to right Heart Machine's ailing vessel, as the studio began a second round of layoffs late last week. This time the cuts were focussed on the team creating the side-scrolling action/adventure Possessor(s), occurring less than a fortnight before the game is due to launch. The combined layoffs have led some players to question whether to continue supporting Heart Machine financially. In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches.

Forget roguelikes, or friendslop, or rogue friends, or sloplikes, eggs are the hottest they've been in the virtual realm since the days of Tamagotchi. Just how hot, you ask? Well, there are three egg-themed games launching within a week of each other. Which isn't that many in the grand Steam of things, but in my book it still qualifies as an eggstrava—no, spare them the egg puns, Rick. Nobody deserves that. Two of these games are similar to the point where they could've been laid by the same hen. The other looks like it sluiced from the cloaca of some shrieking nightmare chicken that escaped from Cthulhu's battery farm. Anyway, let's cra- uh, move on, starting with the simplest. Egg (subtitled 'Why not be an egg'?) is the new game from VVVVVV and Super Hexagon creator Terry Cavanagh. Available on Itch, it's a lo-fi, 3D puzzle platformer where you must guide a box of half-a-dozen eggs across a vertiginous, grassy cliffside searching for a lovely nest to, well, nestle in. The eggs navigate across the landscape by jumping. The longer you hold down the spacebar, the farther your chosen ovum will jump. If an egg falls off a platform, it breaks,…",

    "body": "I practically heard the monkey's paw curling a finger when Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow was revealed back in June . Here after more than a decade, was an honest-to-god new Thief game, one that brings back Stephen Russell to lend his gravelly tones to Garrett. \"But you don't get to play as him\", the antique shop owner cackled as he handed over the blackjack. \"And by the way, it's a VR game , mwa-ha-ha-haaa!\" As Fraser Brown explained shortly after the reveal , it felt like being slapped in the face, especially when the Thief community has so brilliantly carried the torch (insofar as a Thief fan would ever carry a torch) in the form of unofficial campaigns like The Black Parade . Yet having watched the most recent trailer for the game, which accompanied an announcement for Legacy of Shadow's release date, I wonder whether I was a bit too quick to judge. The trailer shows new protagonist Magpie breaking into a house in New Quarter to retrieve a valuable mask. The moment-to-moment play looks more promising than the brief snippets shown in the original trailer. VR's inherent tactility seems smartly deployed in how it lets you clamber up walls, drag knocked-out enemies around, pick up loo…",

    "body": "Remedy Entertainment's woes continue with FBC: Firebreak . The cooperative shooter proved a disappointment when it released in June, launching in an anaemic state, lacking basic features like in-game voice chat and a tutorial, and generally seeming like a compromised vision despite a few novel ideas. Its first major update, Breakpoint, went some way to addressing these issues , but failed to provide the bump in players Remedy hoped for. Indeed, at the time of writing, just 25 people were playing FBC: Firebreak according to SteamDB . The actual count is likely higher given Firebreak's availability on consoles and Game Pass, but probably not by much. In early October, Remedy issued a profit warning for 2025 due to Firebreak's underperformance. Less than two weeks later, Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, stepped down with immediate effect. Now, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz , Remedy has issued its financial results for Q3 2025, posting a 32% decline in revenue versus Q3 2024, and an operating loss of €16.4 million. Unsurprisingly, Firebreak is the chief culprit, with Remedy recognising a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million due to the shooter's poor performance. Speaking in the report, …",

    "body": "Andrzej Sapkowski recently wrote a prequel to his Witcher novels, Crossroads of Ravens . At an event to publicize that novel, our colleagues at GamesRadar asked the author if he'd been involved in any part of the development of The Witcher 4. And he said, basically: nope. While explaining that the developers at CD Projekt Red did ask for advice and extra details about the setting while working on the previous games, these days apparently \"it's so rare\" that CDPR contact him to ask about the lore. Which makes sense, given how much the studio has added to it over the course of the Witcher games, like building Witcher schools based on an off-hand reference he threw in before regretting it . The other thing Sapkowski had to say about his relationship with CDPR is that, \"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now. Let's hope it stays that way.\" That was in reference to the lawsuit CDPR settled with Sapkowski in 2019 over royalties, with the author asserting that he'd handed over the rights for a pittance compared to the amount they ended up being worth. The Witcher 4 is the start of a new trilogy of Witcher games, though since it only entered full production l…",
