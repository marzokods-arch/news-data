    "body": "As Andy already reported , Microsoft has just announced bumper revenues of over $80 billion for the most recent quarter. But not every division within the tech titan is coining it. Its Xbox hardware revenue continues to fall and even its overall gaming services revenues are on the slide. Xbox hardware revenues are reportedly down by 32% in the final quarter of 2025, while overall gaming revenue was down 9%. Microsoft also says in its earnings release that Xbox content and services revenue, including Game Pass, were down by 5%. So, basically anything to do with Xbox and gaming for Microsoft is on the slide, though as The Verge notes, Microsoft isn't releasing any information on Xbox Game Pass membership rates. That obviously makes it difficult to gauge the impact of the Game Pass Ultimate price hike , which wasn't exactly warmly received by gamers. Microsoft's whole Xbox endeavour, of course, is currently in flux. The company has continued to publish more games for play on Sony's competing PS5 console as part of its broader—and some would argue, incredibly confusing—\" This is an Xbox \" push to redefine what an Xbox means. That push will even extend to jealously guarded IP such as H…",

It's perhaps the most open secret in videogames right now, spoiled ahead of time by everything from age rating boards to anonymous sources to its own lead actor , Matt Ryan—who subsequently told a different fan pressing him for info that'd say nothing more, because \" the company threatened to sue me \". I guess Ubi's loosened up since then, because the official Assassin's Creed X account is now posting GTA memes about yet another possible leak. AC fan account Zephryss posted images of a statuette of Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, writing that it \"might be the new Edward Kenway figurine for the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake\" and had been found by fans on second-hand site Vinted. In response, the AC account posted that old classic: CJ returning to San Andreas with the subtitles \"Ah shit, here we go again.\" For reference, this would be the second time this remake has been leaked by a statue , if genuine. Which is quite funny, to be fair, and makes sense: as I've written in too many headlines…",

This one has guns and a motorbike , mind you, so it's probably the greatest videogame ever made. As a PC Gamer reader of taste who probably arrived here by Googling something like \"so when's Code Vein 2 coming out then,\" you'll probably want to know when Code Vein 2 is coming out, then. I've collated the game's launch times across multiple regions below, so you can know exactly when you can start veining. When does Code Vein 2 launch? (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Code Vein 2 launches at 3 pm PST on January 29 , giving California a good window to get it downloading while it's still at work. Of course, if you got the pricey deluxe edition, then it actually unlocked for you three full days before that time and date, in which case what are you doing here?

It was basically all over for my free time from then on. Which is why it's wild, more than a decade later, to be reminded of Atom Zombie Smasher's existence by it being patched. This 15th anniversary update isn't going to transform the top-down rescue sim where the zombies are tiny pink squares into The Last of Us 3, but it does add a horde of little changes. For starters, where before you could slow time down to 10%, now you can drop it all the way down to 1%. That's so slow you're basically making Atom Zombie Smasher turn-based, a change I approve of in any tactics game. Also changed: you can deselect units with the Escape key; the seams around cutscene vignette art are gone; and when you're on the Behind the Scenes screen the scroll limit works so you don't scroll too far and end up looking at the game as it would be seen from a passing aeroplane.

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

Every other week, I cover topics relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. While the internet reckons with another premature hate campaign against a hero shooter that's just OK, a genuinely exciting new multiplayer FPS is passing most of us by. Not to pick too much on Highguard (review forthcoming), but every minute I'm playing it, I wish I were playing Out of Action instead. Out of Action is the debut project from solo dev Doku Games. After years of dazzling us with clips of electrifying movement and backflip headshots, Out of Action finally landed in early access last week. It's very much a work in progress—basic features like \"weapon reload animations\" and \"non-test maps\" are bound to a roadmap for now—but what it's already got is strong: 12-player lobbies (team or FFA) A real server browser (with dedicated servers) Deep loadout customization and progression A simple leaderboard Two objective modes (with more planned) Also, it's $20 and features zero microtransactions.

    "body": "PC gaming has always been an expensive hobby, even if you stick to entry-level hardware. So much so that the majority of enthusiasts only upgrade their systems piecemeal, one component every so often, or get a new rig after many long years. But if you were hoping to build a new gaming PC or update the CPU and motherboard this year, the shocking cost of DRAM kits right now is making the process considerably challenging. Back in July 2025, you could pick up a 32 GB kit of DDR5-6000, with a CAS latency of 30 cycles, for under $90 (albeit during the sales). For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings. Rated to 4,800 MT/s and with a CAS latency of 38 cycles, this is a set that's only marginall…",

Sure, there's the LAS-16 Trident, which is cool because it fires six entire laser beams, but my new favourite weapon in any videogame ever is the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer, which is a hammer that explodes. This thing is so goddamn stupid. The idea of putting a charge on the end of a long stick that you then proceed to swing at somebody point blank is exactly the kind of ill-advised nonsense that Super Earth's canonically underregulated R&D division would look at and go: \"Sure, whatever, these guys are living for like two minutes anyway.\" You can, of course, swing it like a normal hammer, and the charge is optional. If you're a coward. There's also the GL-28, which is a belt-fed grenade launcher, and the \"EAT-411 Leveller\", which, as you might imagine, levels things. To dust. You can als…",

Its creator, Github user and software engineer Zampierilucas , says that the scheduler is \"100% for educational and entertainment purposes\" and that \"while the astronomical calculations are real and the scheduler actually works\" using astrology to schedule CPU tasks is \"scientifically dubious, cosmically hilarious... [and] perfect for conference talks, hackathons, and proving that anything it possible.\" The scheduler is full of bizarre features, like its ability to perform real planetary calculations based on accurate geocentric planetary positions, lunar phase scheduling (the full moon gives a 1.4x boost to tasking, apparently) and \"zodiac-based tas…",

But he remembers it being an easy choice at the time. \"We had an idea, but it was more of a consensus, like, 'OK, where should the next game be?' And the people that were talking all agreed.
