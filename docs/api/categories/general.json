    "body": "Morgan Wallen ’s I&#8217;m the Problem leads Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart (dated Jan. 17) for the 34th consecutive week. This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 220, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 62-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black art…",

    "body": "By returning to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (dated Jan. 17) for a 13th nonconsecutive week with I’m the Problem, Morgan Wallen ups his career total of weeks at No. 1 on that chart to 42. That tally is topped by only seven acts in history — and by only three male solo artists: Elvis Presley , Garth Brooks and Michael Jackson . Wallen, 32, is the youngest artist on our list of artists who have logged 30 or more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Taylor Swift , who he bumped from the No. 1 spot this week, is 36. A few quick notes: While Presley&#8217;s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album, Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 — which was the chart’s second week. If you count the&nbsp; Saturday Night Fever &nbsp;soundtrack (which logged 24 weeks at No. 1 in 1978) as a&nbsp; Bee Gees&nbsp; album, the trio had 31 weeks on top. Bee Gees had six tracks on the album — five of which were No. 1 hits on the Hot 100. But&nbsp; Billboard &nbsp;counts it …",

Her answer centered on her two children with Blackstock, daughter River and son Remington. &#8220;Snuggle,&#8221; Clarkson said. &#8220;My kids, they&#8217;re 9 and 11. They&#8217;re at that special little fun stage where they can wipe their own behinds, but they&#8217;re still small enough to love cuddling and love snuggles.&#8221; She continued, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot for our family recently, and so I have allowed my kids to sleep with me quite a bit. It&#8217;s my two dogs, my two kids and me. It&#8217;s a lot. It&#8217;s been really special, though, because the conversations you have during that time are pretty cute.
