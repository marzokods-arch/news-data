The real game isn't to see how long I can keep the charade up, but how much I can manage to get done within the relatively short window of peace before everything goes to Hell. The fact that Sintopia takes place in Hell half the time probably should have warned me about how well my antics would go, but I didn't take the hint. Instead, I started my new job as manager of Hell and overlord of the humus, a sentient population of chickpeas. (Image credit: Team 17) Sintopia is kind of like two games in one. The overworld plays like a god game that has you casting spells to influence the humus. They go about their daily business with pretty limited intervention from you, farming crops, cutting down trees, electing a monarch to rule over them, and exploring the map to find new treasures and expand their village. I did spend a little bit of time helping them, like using a wind spell to blow away vicious animals that would attack hunting parties or ringing bells outside their homes at night to stop them from overpopulating the map. But if you asked the jumus, they probably…",

As the patch notes linked above read, there'll be a \"Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter\", the former of which has been giving players considerable trouble . There'll also be a \"Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers\", which are the worms in the Blasted Steps—likely taking their damage from two masks to one. The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines.

That is to say, you can have another Hornet hang out in your world (and vice versa), but I don't think you're gonna be taking on enemies together.

Interpreting these shipping manifests from the NBD website is something of an art in itself. But short version is that there are entries for packaging for something listed as \"G31/C32\", where G31 is thought to be Intel's internal code for a new bigger GPU based on its latest Battlemage or Xe2 graphics tech, as used in the Intel Arc B580 cards you can (kinda) already buy.

Now, though, AMD has finally added the ability to enable FSR 4 in a bunch of games by flipping a toggle switch in the latest Adrenalin driver . The Adrenalin 25.9.1 drivers, AMD explains , enable FSR 4 in over 85 games: \"By updating your AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver, you automatically unlock access to this cutting-edge technology on your AMD Radeon RX 9000-series graphics card. Simply enable FSR 3.1 within the supported game and ensure the FSR 4 toggle is turned on from the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition application.\" These titles are limited to ones that support DirectX 12 and FSR 3.1—more specifically, games that \"have integrated a signed FSR 3.1 DLL according to the guidelines in our FSR 3.1 documentation for developers .\" That doesn't include Vulkan games, unfortunately.

While Sherma doesn't seem very good at the instrument he wields—he basically whacks two nails together towards a discordant \"melody\"—he's got a lovely voice on him, especially with an excess of cavernous reverb applied. Tee Lopes, a videogame composer who's worked on Sonic Mania and Shredder's Revenge, to name a few, has released a remix of Sherma's lil' jingle. It sounds a lot like that style of saccharine European dance pop that was big in the '90s and early 2000s: music that resembles Saturday morning cartoons, but which is actually precision-geared for dancing to while high. Very high. Here it is. I like how Hornet nods out of rhythm in the accompanying video. Bugs will be bugs. Lopes has also done one for Shakra, whose banger sounds like something the Vengaboys might have released at the height of their inexplicable popularity. In the words of YouTube commenter @Akif-Faisal: \"This is what entertainment looks like\". (It may also look, depending on your temperament, like something akin to torture.

Silver Bells locations in Silksong (Image credit: Team Cherry) Once you've defeated the Silksong Widow boss and freed the town of Bellhart, you can find a wish board next to the town shopkeeper with several quests awaiting you. Accept the Silver Bells quest and then enter the Bellhart Bellway fast travel station. At the bottom of the station, instead of heading left to where you call the Bellbeast, head to the right and break the secret wall to enter the lower bellvein, a claustrophobic sequence of tunnels below the town.

I can't think of a better way to kick off an FPS column than to gush about one of the best historical features of the genre, the server browser, while also lamenting its near extinction. It feels like shooters are ready for a shake up, but at least in this instance, I think publishers ought to look toward the past to guide them. Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting . Server browsers were a boon for variety, but as we've learned in the years since their disappearance, they were also crucial tools of preservation.

And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",

The Widow is fast but her attacks are well-telegraphed, so with a little study and patience you can learn her patterns and get through the first phase by making use of your drifter's cloak and new cling grip ability.

Here's what I used to beat the Widow, but there's no must-have bit of gear for this fight .

The route you'll need to take looks a little like this: (Image credit: Team Cherry) Make sure you've got 60 rosaries before starting, ideally secured in the form of a consumable string or a necklace. Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper.
