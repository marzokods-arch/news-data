    "body": "The Iceman rollout continues. Drake announced plans for episode three of his Iceman stream, which is set to debut on Thursday night (Sept. 4) at 9 p.m. ET. It appears the stream was shot during Drake&#8217;s four-show run in Milan that concluded on Tuesday (Sept. 2). The 6 God is in the midst of a few days off before taking the stage in Paris on Sunday (Sept. 7). After dropping off &#8220;What Did I Miss&#8221; and &#8220;Which One&#8221; featuring Central Cee as the lead singles into the Iceman era, there&#8217;s plenty of speculation that a third song is set to be premiered during the episode. At the end of the second Iceman episode, Drake teased a hard-hitting track that sent fans into a frenzy, and they&#8217;re holding out hope the untitled song will be debuted in full during episode three. &#8220;You gotta light the tower up for this,&#8221; Drake raps to open the unreleased tune while the stream shows him moving through the airport solo. Earlier this week, Drake joined Bobbi Althoff for another interview and the launch of her Not This Again podcast.

For decades, federal records show, companies linked to Manilow have applied to register Copacabana-related trademarks, including “Barry Manilow Presents Copacabana” in 1991, “Barry Manilow’s Copacabana” in 2006, “Barry Manilow’s Copacabana Hotel &amp; Casino” in 2023, and another earlier this year. Related Barry Manilow vs. Hipgnosis: Inside the Deal That Led to Dueling&nbsp;Lawsuits But such efforts have so far been unsuccessful, thanks largely to one big problem: Trademarks for the name are already registered by the owners of the Copacabana, the legendary Manhattan nightclub referenced in Manilow’s song. In a May ruling, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected the application for the “Manilow’s Copacabana Hotel” trademark, saying that consumers would likely be confused into thinking — wrongly — that the new brand was some kind of collaboration with the famed New York establishment. “Barry Manilow and the Copa/Copacabana are two cultural icon…",

Pre-orders open on September 5 in the US and UK, with shipping beginning in October. XGIMI is turning up the brightness in home entertainment. This afternoon at IFA 2025, the company introduced the Horizon 20 Series, its most luminous projectors yet, featuring Google TV. With this launch, XGIMI sets its sights squarely on home theater heavyweights like Epson and BenQ. The Horizon 20 Series comes in three variants, the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max, but it’s the Max that steals the spotlight. With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room. That puts it ahead of most portable Google TV projectors and even in the same conversation as mid-range home units from brands like Epson.",

For the manual approach, the F25 Ultra stick vac taps into the power of steam. Old-fashioned chores are going the way of the dodo, and modern smart home devices are getting better and better at taking care of life’s little annoyances that we’d rather just someone (or something) else handle. Roborock already offers an impressive selection of vacuums, from autonomous robotic units to capable stick vacs, and now it’s not only delivering new options there, but expanding into uncharted territory: robotic lawn care. RockMow Z1, S1, and RockNeo Q1 are tailored to yards of all sizes",

The Pixel 10 Pro is just about the perfect Android phone for me, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best Android phone for everyone else. Perhaps you want most of the Pixel 10 Pro’s features, but at a lower price. Maybe you want a more capable chipset or a more comfortable design.",

Google’s Quick Share makes it easy to share files between devices wirelessly, whether that’s with another Android device, Windows PC, or Chromebook. Since April, we’ve been aware that Google was working on a major revamp to the UI. That redesign even started rolling out to some devices recently. Now the new UI is finally rolling out widely.

When the new UI arrives on your device, you’ll see that there are a few differences that add more functionality to the feature.",

The Odin 3 specs, which were shared on Discord and via @Ayn_Loki on X , partly confirm what we already knew — the device will ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 6-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, and an 8,000mAh battery. However, it also fleshes out the different configurations. You’ll be able to pick from models with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at the entry level, right up to an Ultra version with a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That last option wasn’t even in the original plan but was added after fans in the AYN Discord pushed for it.",

Google is barred from requiring OEMs to preload the Play Store or other Google apps in exchange for Search. In the long-running saga, Google appears to have avoided one of the most significant possible outcomes of its US antitrust case . A federal court ruled that the company would not be forced to break up key parts of its business, which included avoiding the sale of both Chrome and Android. According to the ruling from the US District Court for the District of Columbia, “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment.” The court also confirmed that “Google will not have to present users with choice screens on its products or encourage its Android distribution partners to do the same.”",

Google’s new Pixel 10 series introduces some surprise display upgrades, focusing more on viewing comfort than on major hardware changes. While the display panels themselves are largely unchanged, they should be easier on the eyes thanks to new features like Adaptive Tone and an enhanced PWM dimming rate . Another notable change is to Extra Dim, a feature that makes the screen even dimmer than its lowest hardware brightness setting. On the Pixel 10, Google has integrated Extra Dim directly into the brightness slider, making it much easier to control than on previous Pixel phones.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL can shoot in 12-bit 4K video with dedicated third-party apps. The high bit depth is possible thanks to Samsung’s Smart-ISO Pro technology within the image sensor. The Pixel 10 and Pixel Camera app are still capped at 10-bit video capture. The new Google Pixel 10 series already sports some impressive new photo and video capabilities, but it appears that the Pro models are capable of even more than Google advertises. Reddit user RagSaucy has spotted that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL support 12-bit 4K RAW video capture — a first for the series. In theory, a higher bit-depth allows the phone to capture a wider dynamic range, resulting in additional shadow or highlight detail with less risk of over- or underexposure. Previous Pixel flagships are capped at 10-bit video capture, and that’s still the case if you shoot via the Pixel Camera app on the 10 series. To “unlock” the Pixel 10 Pro’s 12-bit option, you have to install a third-party camera app with advanced video shooting modes, such as MotionCamPro.",
