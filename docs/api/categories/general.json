The cause for the malfunction isn’t clear. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Something’s up with YouTube search on desktop. This morning, many users — including us here at Android Authority — have noticed that YouTube’s search filtering options aren’t functioning. This was brought to our attention by a post on the YouTube subreddit by user Kotif92 . YouTube’s search filters, accessible via the Filters link in the top right corner of desktop search results, all show up “grayed out” — the only filter that’s still accessible is the option to sort search results by relevance (which is the default search behavior).",

Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble. And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.

Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The November Pixel update doesn’t list the Pixel 6 or Pixel 7 series because those devices already received all necessary fixes with the September patch. Google’s Pixel Update Bulletin confirms there are no new security patches for Pixel phones in this update, so no additional update was needed this month. The November Pixel Feature Drop still applies to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 phones, so they aren’t missing out on any new features. Google rolled out the November Pixel update earlier this week, right alongside the latest Pixel Drop . The update brought new improvements and bug fixes to the Pixel 7a and above. Naturally, users quickly noticed that the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro were missing from the list of devices receiving Google’s monthly bug-fix update. Folks also speculated that Google is dropping monthly updates for the phones in favor of quarterly patches. It doesn’t help that Google does not provide a public list that definitively separates Pixel phones into monthly and quarterly update groups like Samsung. However, it looks like the reason the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 flagships were not included in the November update l…",

Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

A post by user aniruddhdodiya on the Google Messages subreddit includes screenshots of the new @mention feature in action, apparently on a Pixel 10 running the latest beta version of Messages.

The app launched a few weeks ago, but Play Store approval took a few extra weeks. It’s still early in development, and performance may be worse than AetherSX2/NetherSX2. PlayStation 2 emulation on Android has lagged behind its PC counterpart for years, but a new project is here to change that. Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship.

This time, though, instead of creating a jack of all trades (which, to be fair, was a master of most of them), OnePlus is after power users — or at least, I think it is.

I know the OnePlus 15 is powerful on paper — it boasts the latest chipset, a large battery, ample RAM, and sufficient storage to prove it.

However, there are several reasons why Pixel Drops roll out gradually, over a period of time. Google’s latest November Pixel Feature Drop introduced a number of exciting upgrades for Pixel phones, but many users are finding that most of the new features aren’t actually live yet. While Google’s announcement highlighted features like Notification Summaries, Remix in Google Messages, and more, many people, including members of our team who’ve updated their phones, are only seeing the new Wicked: For Good! theme pack, which is hardly the star of the show in this Pixel Drop. So, what’s going on? Why do Pixel Drop features always seem to arrive in slow motion?",
