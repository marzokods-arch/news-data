The lyrics convey melancholy, telling the story of a person who misses someone and feels they are improving to get back with their ex. Driven by salsa&#8217;s infectious rhythms and reimagined through a modern lens, the song — which bridges generations and honors tradition — laces Fonsi&#8217;s soaring vocals with Feid&#8217;s smooth, melodic voice. Crafted by Fonsi, Feid, Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo, with production by Marcos Sánchez, the song comes alive visually in a vibrant and joyful music video filmed in the streets of San Juan, Puerto Rico by Carlos Perez of ElasticPeople. — INGRID FAJARDO Juanes, &#8220;Hagamos Que&#8221; (Universal Music Latino) Juanes …",

A global launch is not yet confirmed, but if it pans out, it could potentially democratize Bluetooth trackers and significantly boost Android’s Find Hub network. We’ve seen a handful of Android-compatible Bluetooth trackers released over the years, but the market is largely untapped, if Apple’s success with AirTags is any indication.

I’ve tested countless games and phones (not to mention dedicated Android gaming handhelds ), and I’ve honed in on what separates the best from the rest when it comes to mobile gaming. Depending on what you’re looking for, the options below represent the top gaming phones I recommend in 2026. REDMAGIC 11 Pro: The best gaming phone overall If you want the best performing gaming phone on the market, look no further than the REDMAGIC 11 Pro. I was blown away by the performance on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and it’s the only phone I’ve tested so far that can handle the thermal load of Qualcomm’s latest chipset. The realme GT8 Pro provided wildly inconsistent results under stress, and the OnePlus 15 simply shut down in the middle of our benchmark test (although this was fixed in later updates ).",

Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured.

Prompted Playlist debuted in beta in New Zealand last month. It’s now expanding to the US and Canada. Last month, Spotify introduced a feature it calls Prompted Playlist . Prompted Playlist uses AI to generate custom playlists based on your text input, which can be as broad or specific as you like. The feature has been exclusive to testers in New Zealand, but today, Spotify announced that Prompted Playlist is rolling out in beta in the US and Canada. As described in a new blog post from Spotify , Prompted Playlist can make just about any playlist you could think up. You can ask for tracks from a specific genre or set of genres, tracks originally released within a specific span of time, tracks that Spotify has tagged as matching a certain mood — if you can describe a playlist, Prompted Playlist can make it.",

The AI assistant eventually performed the task after the user encouraged it, highlighting a “gaslighting” trend in modern AI. While Gemini in Google Home excels at context, it often struggles with basic commands that the original Google Assistant handled easily. Gemini is slowly but surely replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem. While we wait for a broader rollout, most Google Home users just want the basics to work again. Unfortunately, Google still has some work to do, as Gemini for Home sometimes ends up gaslighting users about what it can and cannot do, as one Reddit user found out.

Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports.

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

We got genuinely useful upgrades like increased use of silicon-carbon batteries and more phones flirting with Qi2-style magnets, but it also felt like a lot of brands spent the year moving sideways rather than forward. We have some insight on the subject, but we also wanted to know what our well-informed readership thought, so we decided to poll you on which Android OEM had the best year overall. To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",

In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction.

If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.
