    "body": "With the release of Android 12 back in 2021, Google made a somewhat controversial change to the Quick Settings panel. Gone were the individual toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

Don’t get me wrong, Samsung phones are made in both of these countries, but the devil is in the details.

Syncing won’t resume automatically — you need to reconnect your Google account to Movies Anywhere to restore it. The fix closes the last major fallout from the feud, which had already been resolved elsewhere weeks ago. If you use Movies Anywhere to keep your movie purchases in one place, there’s some low-key good news to end the week. After disappearing during YouTube TV and Disney’s contract spat , syncing for Google Play and YouTube purchases is finally working again. As reported by 9to5Google , Google Play and YouTube have now been restored as Movies Anywhere partners. Disney owns Movies Anywhere, and the service dropped Google support during the dispute, resulting in a break in cross-platform syncing. Now that Google has been reinstated, things are mostly back to normal. You just have to take one extra step.",

SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen. While Lenovo had the option to choose the Xbox full-screen experience (FSE) , as did with the 2025 variants of ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X. However, it appears to have gone with SteamOS for its advantages, including lower hardware requirements, better power management,…",

Freelancer Whose Moon Mascot design will join the Artemis II astronauts on their historic voyage around the Moon in early 2026? Between March 7 and Jun. 16, 2025, NASA worked with crowdsourcing company Freelancer to seek design ideas from global creators for a zero gravity indicator that will fly aboard the agency’s Artemis II test flight. Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space. Artemis II marks the first time that the public has had a hand in creating a crew’s mascot. The Mission Over…",

Users had to visit app settings in the settings menu to uninstall system app updates. The change appears to have been reverted, although it is unclear whether it was a bug or an intentional change in the first place. Update: December 18, 2025 (4:33 AM ET): It appears that Google has reconsidered this change and reverted it, allowing you to easily uninstall updates again. As Android Authority contributor AssembleDebug pointed out on X , once you update a pre-installed system app, the “Uninstall” button appears next to the “Open” button following the install, as it did previously.",

As part of its efforts to bring Android to PCs with ‘ Aluminium OS ,’ Google has been steadily improving how the operating system handles input peripherals, app windowing, and external displays. This includes both big changes that the majority of users expect from desktop OSes as well as smaller tweaks that only a fraction of users will appreciate. With the release of Android 16 in June, for example, Google updated the screen recorder dialog to allow you to select external displays, enabling you to record activity on them.
