If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes. Spoilers follow, but this includes: Preventing the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields from getting stuck under lava, preventing Shrine Guardian Seth from exiting the battle arena mid-combat, and making sure Lugoli stops \"flying off screen and not returning during battle\". I like a tough metroidvania and wouldn't advocate for any difficulty tweaks, but I know there are plenty of players who are frustrated with Silksong's difficulty. I guess the message is clear: if Silksong is too hard for you, keep trying . There's the chance Team Cherry will tweak dif…",

That would be such a fundamental bug that it would effectively break the game. Anyway, I loaded in, did some testing, and you can probably guess where this is going. We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds. The bug even seems to extend to Patrol zones, although I was occasionally able to self-revive. Quite how long it will take to fix is anyone's guess, but as you can tell by the tone of Bungie's tweet, this is a four alarm fire. You cannot have players trying to complete every solo activity in the game on a single life. I would love to tell you I'm surprised that a bug of …",

Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

Several studios were closed outright, games were cancelled, and almost everything in Microsoft's portfolio was touched in some way, with the aftershocks still coming . One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs. Such was the impact of the latter that, despite not being included in the initial round of cuts, long-serving ZeniMax president Matt Firor fell on his sword after 18 years as studio head. \"He wore a lot of different hats,\" says Rich Lambert, the new studio game director at Zenimax, in a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz . Firor's responsibilities have been split across Lambert and new studio head Jo Burba, who's \"focused on the operational side of things, and I'm focused on a lot of studio-level things and future planning.\" Some would speculate the layoffs are what lies behind Firor's departure and, while Lambert doesn't confirm this, he make…",

That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

While it works a little differently this time around, you'll still need to find Maurice's Black Market location each week. If you're a Destiny 2 convert, then Maurice's vending machine is effectively Xur. Each week, the Black Market machine will spawn in a new location somewhere on Kairos, giving you access to top-tier loot in return for cash. With Borderlands 4 moving to a full open-world with Kairos, though, you'll have even more ground to cover to track his machine down. Where is the Borderlands 4 Black Market location this week? Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) For the week of September 12 to September 19, Maurice's Black Market vending machine is located in Plungeford, in the north of Coastal Bonescape, Fadefields . You can find the vending machine on the balcony of the tallest building in the area. The Black Market machine resets every Friday at 12:00 am EDT / 5 am BST. The biggest change to the weekly Black Market in Borderlands 4 is that the inventory on offer is unique to …",

In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias.

But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage.
