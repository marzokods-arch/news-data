The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

Besides reminding you not to forget it while stepping out of the house, the feature can also instantly alert you if your iPhone gets stolen.

Dropping at midnight, “Beat Yourself Up” is brassy, bass-y, catchy, and could’ve stepped right out of a time when the Detroit Pistons were beating everyone up in the NBA, and muscles ruled Hollywood. “Beat Yourself Up” is housed by the singer and songwriter’s forthcoming studio album, Whatever’s Clever! (via Atlantic Records), due out on March 27. The fresh cut “started as something I wanted to tell a friend,” the award-winning artist explains. “We’ve never been the heart-to-heart types, so I wrote it in a song instead,” he continues. “I wanted to tell him that even though he has made mistakes along the way, he shouldn’t be so hard on himself. That things will get better and he’s not alone.” It&#8217;s the second track lifted from his forthcoming album, following &#8220;Changes,&#8221; which arrived last October , coupled with his baby news.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production.

Pei claimed that the specs race will end this year and that the era of “cheap silicon” was over. He added that the user experience will be the only way phones can stand out. RAM prices have shot through the roof, and this crisis affects smartphones , too. In fact, companies like Xiaomi and Samsung have warned of higher phone prices in 2026. Now, Nothing co-founder Carl Pei has echoed these warnings, while giving us a hint of what to expect from Nothing phones later this year. In a post on LinkedIn and Twitter titled “Why your next smartphone will cost more,” Pei called 2026 an unprecedented year for electronics:",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is testing a design upgrade for the Remix feature in the Photos app. With this refresh, Google Photos could sort templates into categories and help you choose the right one more quickly. The update isn’t out yet, and the existing version also appears half-baked, suggesting some wait time before it arrives for users. Remix is one of the most exciting features in Google Photos . You can recreate your existing images in different art styles or let Nano Banana transform them into entirely new ones with you in the spotlight. Google already offers a range of presets to let you quickly remix your images using templates, such as for professional headshots or a Christmas-themed scene. It is natural to expect that more templates will be added over time, which could make it difficult to arrange them. Thankfully, Google is experimenting with ways to sort Remix templates so they’re easy to access. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",
