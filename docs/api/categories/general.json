Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront.

It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well.

One UI 8.5 is the next big update to Samsung’s Android skin. The beta program is expected to start next week , but leaks continue to emerge rapidly. Earlier this week, a leaked changelog provided a glimpse into what to expect in the upcoming update, and now a build for the Galaxy S24 Ultra has leaked, offering a firsthand look at some of these changes . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR New code spotted in One UI 8.5 firmware reveals a new “short summary” feature for the My Files app. When enabled, My Files would generate brief previews of the contents of TXT and PDF files without opening them. It is unclear if this feature relies on the cloud or on-device processing for these summaries. Samsung’s next One UI release was long expected to be a significant update, but the leaked One UI 8.5 changelog provided a clearer sense of its magnitude. While the leaked changelog serves as a good baseline, we’ve now spotted code for new features in the leaked One UI 8.5 firmware that aren’t included in this changelog. In future One UI builds, the My Files app will soon receive a file summary feature to help you open the right file.

    "body": "If you recently updated your Pixel phone to Android 16 QPR2 , you’ve probably noticed that there are a lot of new features for you to play with. With improved app icon customization, lock screen widgets , and more, QPR2 is a darn good update. One of the more interesting changes is actually a reversal of something added in Android 16 QPR1 this past September. As part of the Material 3 Expressive interface added to Pixel phones with that update, one of the bigger UI tweaks was a blur effect in the app drawer and Quick Settings panel. I don’t mind it, but it’s something a lot of Pixel users have wanted Google to get rid of.",
