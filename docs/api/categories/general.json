Nonetheless, over almost three decades of irradiated exploration, some standout missions have emerged. Most are potent displays of the genre's potential for reactivity—tales which allow for creative approaches, and multiple outcomes you'd never uncover without a spot of wiki-diving. Others are memorable simply because they're odd: creepy, daft or moving, written in a distinct tone that stands out against the green-grey backdrop of wasteland America. Either way, they stick in the head like a Bing Crosby number played on a tinny radio.

Asus does point out on its security advisory page that although the problem is widespread and has a CVE rating of 7 (High severity), the vulnerability does require local access to the motherboard in order to gain access to the system RAM. The problem relates to the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) and add-on PCIe devices. The former has all kinds of protection mechanisms for direct memory access (DMA) operations, but Asus doesn't fully activate them on its Intel motherboards until just before the operating system is able to take over DMA protection duties. In other words, between first booting up the motherboard and the OS managing DMA operations, there's a window of opportunity for someone to use a PCIe device to gain access to system memory.

That weird, huge, mushy mutated monster in the giant spice tank with a whole posse of bald dudes dressed in garbage bags vacuuming up the Navigator's, I dunno what the slop is it's leaking… tank sweat? It rules. The third-stage Guild Navigator is the best and weirdest part of a very good and very weird movie. And yet, Denis Villeneuve has now made two Dune movies, and we still haven't seen his version of the third-stage Guild Navigator. Since Dune: Awakening is based on Villeneuve's Dune movies, we haven't seen a third-stage Guild Navigator in the game, either. (Image credit: Universal Pictures) This is, frankly, a crime against casual Dune fans like myself. Look at it this way: I just paid Amazon $3.79 to rent it so I could check, and in Lynch's Dune movie, the Guild Navigator shows up precisely at the 8-minute mark . …",

In particular, a scene where a child was depicted riding on the back of one of the farm's captives , the horse-headed captive being naked. This was later changed before the release of the full game. In a new press release, Santa Ragione has stated that the game sold 18,000 copies thanks to \"extraordinary coverage of the bans, GOG's public support, and a very positive reaction from players.\" This was enough for the studio to tidy up its loans and royalties, but not enough for the \"production on a new game.\" It adds: \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development.

I can't imagine playing Diablo 4 without sanctification, a new crafting system that is technically exclusive to the season but shouldn't be because it's almost perfect. It is responsible for dramatically improving the core loop of the game in ways I wasn't really expecting after playing with an unfinished version on the test server a few months ago. Sanctification is essentially a way to gamble with items for a chance at extraordinary outcomes. You take a piece of gear to a special forge and roll the dice to see what new bonuses are added to them. And those bonuses aren't always some extra strength or maximum life; they can add effects from the best items in the game. A forgettable pair of gloves can become the most powerful gloves you've ever worn, if you're lucky enough. This means every piece of loot is an opportunity for something amazing.

As a reader of PC Gamer you're probably an expert when it comes to PC hardware... but what about the PC hardware inside your PC software? When it comes to the computers that appear inside the games on your computer, do you know your stuff? For instance, could you identify a RoboCo Industries UOS desktop terminal on sight? Would you immediately recognize a Hock King 486 DX50? How about the Siefert InvestiMagic 6600 or the Karnak XOM? Let's find out! In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a PC that appears in a PC game. All you have to do is type the name of the PC game it's from, and you'll score a point. Need help? Click the hint button and it'll start revealing the game name, one letter at a time. We'll start out with some easy ones, but be warned, this one could get a bit tricky. Let us know how you did in the comments!",

Barone said shortly after confirming the Stardew Valley 1.7 update is on the way that \"it’s hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved,\" but in a more recent post he pretty strongly implied that there's a lot more in the pipe than just improvements. \"There will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type,\" Barone wrote in response to a user who asked for a hint about the update. \"Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet.\" (Image credit: Eric Barone (Twitter)) Keeping his cards close to the vest is Barone's way: We didn't get the full skinny on the 1.6 update until it went live in March 2024, although Barone did have fun winding everyone up with \" one patch note per day \" teases. You can get away with that sort of thing when you've made what is basically the most popular indie videogame in the history of humanity. The irony here is that Barone said just a few months ago that he doesn't want \"too much hype\" f…",

That's per an interview with TheGamer , wherein Larian CEO Swen Vincke told the site that it's facing issues with \"the price of RAM and the price of SSDs and fuck, man. It's like, literally, we've never had it like this\". The problem is, it seems, the slow pace of game development—especially if you're Larian, you're going to be designing architecture for a game that'll be both simultaneously coming out in a few years but also releasing now, so figuring out a level of optimisation that's reasonable (while still making the thing look good) takes a bit of soothsaying. \"It kind of ruins all of your projections that you had about,\" he explains, \"because normally, you know the curves, and you can protect the hardware. It's gonna be an interesting one. It means that most likely, we already need to do a lot of optimization work in early access that we didn't necessarily want to do at that point in time.\" …",

And at first glance, a report that Nvidia is planning on cutting discrete GPU production by up to 40% just seems like a case in point. However, while it is all RAM-related, it's not necessarily bad tidings. The claim in question was posted on the Chinese Board Channels forum (via Benchlife and Overclock3D ) and basically claims that Nvidia is set to reduce the supply of its gaming GPUs by between 30% and 40% in the first half of 2026, compared to the volume of output during the same period in 2025. That's not surprising given that the DRAM supply problems, affecting the entire computing industry, will result in fewer desktop and laptop PCs being shipped next year. Given just how many of them typically sport an Nvidia discrete GPU, either soldered onto the motherboard or in the form of a third-party graphics card, the demand for RTX Blackwell chips is obviously going to plummet. However, there's not exactly a huge shortage of GeForce RTX 50-series cards at the moment, with the exception of sensibly priced RTX 5080 and 5090 models.…",

But first, it's time to butter up executive producer Jonathan Nolan. Bethesda execs have previously spoken about how a Fallout adaptation could've come much sooner, except Howard didn't want the usual \"videogame directors\" to come in and make a hash of it . But Nolan, co-writer on the likes of Westworld, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight trilogy? \"It turned out he was a huge fan of Fallout,\" Howard told the BBC's Newsbeat , adding that the two have become \"very close friends\" working on the show. \"Everyone involved is on the same page with how they want to treat it with authenticity.\" That authenticity is what led to an early decision that the TV show would be \"canon\" within the Fallout universe.

The shopper in question goes by the handle BravoNorris, and had scooped up the last four available XPG Caster 32 GB DDR5-6000 CL40 kits from Adata, each containing two sticks of 16 GB memory. All were sold as new and sealed from Amazon Spain. After selling one, and installing another, BravoNorris opened a third box only to find the sticker scam in their hand. That's when they reached out to VideoCardz with the story . This third box was plastic-wrapped like the other three, and had shipped from the same point of origin in Ireland. However, this box contained two old sticks of DDR2 memory with DDR5 heatsink stickers that could fool someone only checking the product through the packaging window. BravoNorris also found a small plate of metal inside the box, likely placed to account for the weight discrepancy. As such, what'…",
