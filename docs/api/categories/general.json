But this is the really exciting bit. Not only will this factory focus on OLED panels for monitors, laptops and tablets, at least at first, but it also uses a novel inkjet manufacturing process to reduce costs. Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones. Aside from the size of the substrate being produced, TCL's new factory is also interesting by virtue of using an inkjet process to \"print\" the panels . LG an…",

The consensus among the user reviews, even the positive ones, is that Bloodlines 2 doesn't really earn the name, and that it has a surprising dearth of RPG systems for something that calls itself an RPG. \"It is a good VtM game, but it is not a Bloodlines game,\" one positive review reads. \"Paradox could have saved them a ton of outrage by marketing it differently.\" But they're not all so balanced. \"Nothing about this game is what you sold us 6 years [ago],\" reads a less favourable review, \"and you don't deserve to be let off the hook for that.\" I'm not remotely surprised by the response so far. I had a good time skulking through the streets of blizzard-battered Seattle, giving it a respectable 78 in my Bloodlines 2 review , but the most common criticisms are the same ones I had. It's a narrative-driven mystery, an investigative adventure game, masquerading as an RPG with only the thinnest RPG systems. And it p…",

And then apparently recommending potentially dangerous 'fixes' that, er, don't even work. At least, that seems to be the case with Cooler Master's support recommendation to a customer who connected support about a power connector that wouldn't fit their GPU. This is relayed by Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab who, true to form, has thoroughly tested the power cable and the proposed fix. The problem the customer relayed was that the angled connector that came included with a certain Cooler Master power supply was angled so it was hitting the cooler when attempting to plug it into an Asus RTX 5070 Ti OC. Cooler Master's suggested fix was to adjust the angle of the cable by using \"a small pick or flat screwdriver to release the clips from both sides of the cap.\" If your initial reaction to this suggestion isn't to pull a cartoonish O-face, then maybe you've forgotten about the fact that these 12V-2x6 cables seem to be prone to melting , at least with higher-end graphics cards.

Don't misunderstand, everything our Jacob loved in his wired Scuf Valor Pro review is here too—just at a much higher price point. Whereas the wired version of this controller will set you back $100 , this wireless update is asking just shy of $190 . Offering 'Tri-mode connectivity' for your PC, Xbox, and Bluetooth devices, it's not just the wireless functionality pushing the price uncomfortably close to 200 big ones, but new asymmetric TMR thumbsticks too. Utilising magnetism like the Hall effect, TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) also offers the same longevity and effective banishment of stick drift. However, TMR is far more sensitive than the Hall effect, with the electromagnetic sensors able to pick up far slighter stick movements for an even greater level of precision—so, that's what you're paying a premium for.

Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill.

I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit.

There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go.

(Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",

Bloodlines 2 helps with the search by making its circular crosshair grow in size when you're close to something valuable, but who knows what that something is. Fortunately for you and Fletcher both, I've already scouted every Anarch Tag location in Bloodlines 2 and created a map of the city highlighting all of them. All Bloodlines 2 Anarch Tag locations (Image credit: The Chinese Room, Paradox Interactive) Finding every Anarch Tag in Bloodlines 2 requires quite a bit of climbing—almost all of them are on a rooftop somewhere.

They aren't hanging around as random spawns in the middle of the map though, so you'll need to find them at their camp a little off the beaten path.

They're bright red, very fast, and wielding those butcher knives you need to loot off them to complete the Hunter's Path quest.

I spent ages searching for the option too, but there is no manual save in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. The system is a tad barebones and what you see from the beginning is what you get. Unless you're willing to repeat quests completely, the vampire RPG makes you dig Phyre's grave, then lie in it. How do you save in Bloodliness 2? The only way to save in Bloodlines 2 is its auto-save system which keeps your progress through vampire-infested Seattle. When an auto-save is in progress, you'll see an icon in the top right corner of the screen that looks like the Anarch Tags spraypainted around the city. Quitting the game doesn't trigger a save, either, in my experience.

Let's start with the most eye-popping feature, the number of USB ports on the rear IO panel. At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports. These support up to 40 Gbps in Thunderbolt 4 mode, 20 Gbps in USB4 mode, or 10 Gbps when operating as USB 3.2 Type-C sockets, as well as providing DisplayPort 2.1 outputs.

Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130.

In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money. At the same time, there's the OLED brightness thing, with full-panel brightness remaining a fraction of that achieved by LCD TV with LED backlights. Oh, and the whole burn-in fiasco.

At the time, there were few other models to choose from, but that's considerably changed over the months, and MSI faces stiff competition at this price point. The Z890 Tomahawk's original MSRP was $300, though you're more likely to find it around the $260 mark, and while that's not a huge reduction, it brings it more in line with boards from ASRock and Gigabyte. That's not the only thing that's changed since last year, as the performance of Arrow Lake has noticeably improved due to a wealth of microcode, BIOS, and Windows updates. In gaming, Core Ultra 200S still lag behind AMD's Ryzen 9000-series, though. MSI's Tomahawk series of motherboards has been around since 2018, as part of its budget and mainstream selection of products, sporting the MAG (MSI Arsenal Gaming) moniker.

    "body": "Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 's main quest is an elaborate, labyrinthine conundrum that spans a century, full of vibrant characters and evocative writing. Bloodlines 2's sidequests, on the other hand, are pointless, one-note tasks that will send you into a torpor. Every night, the primogens of Seattle's vampire clans sit around in their havens, waiting for you, Sheriff Phyre, to come and solve things that one of their goons should be handling. The absolute best you can hope for is some murder, being sent to kill a human in need of a beatdown or a ghoul who's gotten too big for its britches. (Image credit: Paradox) Otherwise, you'll be searching for CCTV cameras, decorative crosses, graffiti and packages. Yeah, we're talking bottom-of-the-barrel filler quests here—stuff that you'd even roll your eyes at in a quest-laden MMO. In a brisk 20-30 hour narrative-driven RPG, they're unacceptably bad. These quests are devoid of plot, have little to no impact on the rest of the game, and since this is an RPG without gear, the rewards are terribly basic. XP, which you'll get plenty of during the main quest, and blood resonance, which you can gain from feeding on Seattle's human pop…",

    "body": "There's always one question on everyone's mind when a big new RPG appears. Don't be embarrassed—I know you're curious. You want to know if you can hook up with any of the immortal bloodsuckers and find romance in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 . I've got good news and bad news. In the World of Darkness, the universe in which Vampire: The Masquerade is contained, romance is kinda complicated. More complicated than usual, I mean. This is because vamps aren't human. Like Phyre themself says, the Beast—the demonic apex predator inside every vampire—hollows them out, removing human emotions like love. With that bit of lore in mind, let's dig in. Can you romance NPCs in Bloodlines 2? (Image credit: Paradox) There is what The Chinese Room calls \"romantic feeding\" in Bloodlines 2, but if you're looking for traditional RPG romance systems then you're out of luck. While vampires can retain some of their humanity—which there's a system for in both the tabletop game and Bloodlines 1, but not the sequel—in most cases their former nature gets squeezed out by the Beast, the source of all their darker proclivities.
