A good, deep D&D adventure as I imagined them to be—basically Mazes and Monsters , minus the moral panic psychosis—was out of reach. The first Baldur's Gate changed all that, with great dungeons, an epic quest, and most important of all, a deep cast of characters with their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities—and who, just like in the real world, would sometimes gel or clash with their fellows in unexpected ways. Some became fast friends, others would try to literally murder each other, and a handful would just throw their hands up in disgust at my obvious incompetence and leave, after giving me a good telling-off of course. Baldur's Gate 2 raised the stakes with a more focused cast and wider range of interpersonal possibilities, plus an unpleasant kickoff that reminded me just how much these characters meant.

A settlement was filed on Monday in a lawsuit between music record labels and the Internet Archive, which the labels alleged committed copyright infringement with its “Great 78 Project” music preservation program. The terms of the settlement and the amount haven’t been announced yet (and it’s likely the amount won’t be publicly revealed), but an order of dismissal for the case was also filed on Monday after the settlement. The Internet Archive team hasn’t said much, either, only offering a short update on its blog stating, “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.” It’s the end to a case that was originally filed back in 2023 and marks yet another clash between copyright protection and content preservation. The “Great 78 Project” at the heart of the case aimed to digitize and preserve 78 rpm shellac records , or “78s”, which were made roughly from 1898 through the 1950s. They were basically the precursor to vinyl. So, this wasn’t m…",

It's a very good game, actually: a plane-hopping, swashbuckling, high-fantasy adventure filled with great performances and memorable characters. But that's not quite enough explanation, is it? There have been a lot of very good games in the past few decades, and not all of them get anniversary write-ups. Heck, personally I'm more of a Baldur's Gate 1 guy, and yet I don't think I said a thing when that game's 25-year anniversary hit two years ago. It's because Baldur's Gate 2 is a lot more than just Baldur's Gate 2. It represents BioWare hitting on an approach to design that would define it—and consequently, so much other RPG development—for over a decade afterwards. BioWare never stopped making Baldur's Gate 2 once it made it the first time.

In 1998, Baldur's Gate redefined what a computer RPG – and videogame interpretation of the D&D ruleset – could be. Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made. Many of the great RPGs are etched into the popular imagination by their beginnings, those tentative first steps in a new fantasy world that tease the vastness ahead, and the freedom to carve your own path through it. The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla. Surrounded by golden minarets, it's a bustling amphitheater of traders and thieves, wealthy and poor – a filthy and vibrant snapshot of urban plenitude.

The headline feature of this patch was a newly added playpark for kids to run themselves ragged on, as well as a 'play pretend' interaction for kids who presumably can't get to said playpark for whatever reason.

It's not one of those games that's completely busted without mods, but if you play it at any resolution above 1080p all the text will look like it was written for ants.

You take control of a private dick investigating a kooky cult out in the countryside, and things naturally take a turn for the cosmic and horrific⁠—who knew there were so many primordial stone catacombs under Anytown, USA? The boomer shooter vibe, dudes in robes, and bundle of dynamite-as-grenade all harken to the classic shooter Blood , but I've always thought Cultic takes at least as much of a page from Resident Evil 4. It has that same autumnal vibe as RE4, these dark forests and abandoned townships calling to mind the ones I explored in Spain a lonely and rural part of Europe. Cultic also boasts a simple, but gratifying weapon upgrade system like RE4's, and its variety of encounters also reminds me of Capcom's opus. Cultic is always surprising and exciting in this clas…",

Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens. Central to the series' appeal was how its action scenes grew more impressive and elaborate with every passing episode, and it was always fun to see how far Krinkels could push things when a new entry dropped. I haven't thought about Madness for a long time (though the series hasn't gone away, as I'll get to shortly). But those memories came flooding back when I spied Somewhere in Hell , a Doom 2 mod that goes to impressive lengths to recreate Madness' flashy, bloody action in id Software's shooter sequel. Somewhere in Hell basically replaces Doom's weapons and enemies with goons and firearms from Krinkels' animations. But what's impressive is how modder Recurracy 2 has infused the mod with the speed and vicious lethality of Krinkels' animations. The legions of monochromatic foes you face move across the …",

Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game.

If you're wondering what's so unprofessional about the overview, he goes on to freestyle a few facts about the game, like how its ambient soundtrack is \"kind of subtle and cool and interesting, unlike anything you've ever played,\" before transitioning to what feels like the end of his spiel. \"Are you interested in novelty? Are you a novelty-seeking person? I don't know. You just want to play the same thing over and over again, maybe. Maybe you like League of Legends, that's fine. You're probably not going to buy this game … Alright. Hope you buy it. Goodbye.\" After this is said, there are seven minutes left to go in the video. Cuzzillo notes that he's \"not going to do the edit\" and then just… starts over and reintroduces \"the first fact\" about Baby Steps.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. I can't think of a time when I was solely obsessed with a singular FPS. Even at the height of a 2,000+ hour, multi-year relationship with Rainbow Six Siege, I still regularly played some Call of Duty and Overwatch with friends. That lack of focus probably explains why I was good but never great at Siege, but it's all part of a healthy FPS rotation. That's a thing we all have, right? A handful of shooters we bounce between throughout the year? Maybe you do it for your favorite singleplayer campaigns, or perhaps it's not even a conscious exercise, but it's natural to ebb and flow between familiar shooters that scratch different itches. Earlier this year, I started keeping track of my FPS rotation. I used Backloggd —a journaling site that's basically Letterboxd for games—to make a living list of the shooters I'm always playing, but never at the same time. Right now, my FPS rotation is at 10.

Blevins began his career as a pro gamer, and achieved some success, but was a relatively low-level streamer until 2017/18, when his fondness for Fortnite coincided with the game exploding in popularity. This led to some incredible numbers for Blevins, who became synonymous with the game on Twitch: thanks to team-ups with stars like Drake and Travis Scott, some streams were pulling in just under 700,000 live viewers. He was so big that in 2020 Epic added Ninja skins to the game. These days Blevin is still huge: the third most-popular streamer on Twitch, with over 67 million followers across platforms. But those kinds of numbers are now beyond him (or most anyone), and elements of the internet won't let him forget it. Blevins says every time he streams the \"haters\" are straight in to \"berate\" him for his lower viewership numbers: \"I think I'm the only streamer on the planet who was pulling 100,000 viewers [per stream] consistently, but now I get like seven or eight thousand across Twitch and YouTube,\" said Blevins. \"So that's somet…",
