The shooter has a couple animal heroes already: Winston, a super-intelligent gorilla, and Wrecking Ball, a mech piloted by a hamster named Hammond. On the other hand, as Reddit user mikoga points out , those heroes are protected by powerful mechanized armor. Jetpack Cat is 90% just-a-cat. \"I don't want to shoot at a normal ass cat,\" mikoga said. I hadn't really considered it before seeing that comment, but I might also not want to shoot at a normal ass cat, although there are some compelling rebuttals in the thread. Hammond may be protected by a mech suit, notes one commenter, but his little hamster body sometimes spills out of the cockpit when he's eliminated. The mech also explodes a fair bit, as I recall. That does make it hard to claim that Jetpack Cat is an aberration: Overwatch has been annihilating furballs for some time now. Other arguments boil down to 'you won't feel bad once she's annoying the hell out of you.' Jetpack Cat …",

It is, by every measure (well, except that movie ) an unmitigated success. And apparently, Chris Metzen, the executive creative director of the Warcraft universe, sometimes wishes it had a different name. This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible.

That sounds like an awfully long time to me, but it seems to be the going rate for union contracts with Microsoft— Raven's QA workers also took three years to get theirs sorted. Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits. A statement provided by the Communications Workers of America—the union that represents the workers—confirms that the QA staff will have guaranteed wage increases; more regulations on AI and generative AI usage at work to ensure workers are supported, not replaced; protections on fair crediting; disability accommodations; immigrant worker protection; and restrictions on \"mandatory 'crunch time' or excessive overtime hours.\" All in all, this is…",

Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ).

    "body": "PC hardware YouTube channel der8auer has posted a video covering \"surging\" copper prices and explaining the potential impact on PC hardware . And it's not good, peeps. Roman Hartung who fronts the der8auer channel is also CEO of PC cooling specialist Thermal Grizzly. In that capacity, he's directly involved in buying 12 mm thick copper plates which are used via CNC manufacturing to produce items such as water cooling blocks for graphics cards. Hartung says he attempted to make a routine order for the plates back in October. Normally, the copper plates are shipped out within a few weeks of placing an order. But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks. Today, he says the company would have to pay 280 euros per plate, potentially making the cooling block product non-viable. Hartung points out that in terms of market commodity pricing, copper has increased from $9,000 per tonne a year ago to an all-time…",

With the Maxwell 2, though, Audeze is hoping that it will do exactly that and be the new champion for peerless audio in games. I was certainly expecting it to be something special, as I've been using the Audeze Maxwell on a daily basis, work and gaming, for just over a year (and our hardware overlord-in-chief Dave has been using his set for even longer). Or rather, just like Audeze, I was hoping it would be better, because as much as I really like the Maxwell, there are a few things that really annoy me about it. Let me just cut to the chase, then: Taking all things into account, the Audeze Maxwell 2 isn't unreservedly better than the first-generation Maxwell. It's improved in some areas, but it's regressed in others (or just not improved), and given that it's a little bit more expensive, it's hard to recommend that you buy the Maxwell 2 instead of the original Maxwell. However, if you browse through Audeze's store, you'll notice this has all been made somewhat moot because the OG Maxwell is now mostl…",

I'm also one of those pretentious gits that thinks videogames don't have to be fun to be worth making or playing, though. Very much in the 'it's the point' camp is game director of Nioh 3 Masaki Fujita, who spoke with Eurogamer on the subject this week. In case you're unfamiliar, Nioh 3 is a soulslike action game with an emphasis on skill expression and difficulty. As contributor Lewis Parker puts it in his Nioh 3 review , it has a \"far more fine-tuned and in-depth approach to combat\", more Sekiro than Elden Ring. But that's getting into the weeds a little bit: Point is, it's a bit hard. Fujita tells the site that \"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series.

In a recent chat with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Zelnick pointed out that, look, the company must be confident in the November 19 date, because it's spent all this goshdang money on marketing the game in the lead-up time. \"We have marketing beats coming this summer, and we don't spend money on marketing until we're pretty close to release,\" said Zelnick. To be clear, he means more than just putting out a slick trailer in the tail-end of 2023 . Think ads on buses, billboards, a never-ending feast of GTA 6 imagery jammed in your eyes and ears for months on end. It'll be fun!

This is a particularly handy metric given that one of the best known existing trackers of OLED burn-in by Monitors Unboxed has been based on a monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel . Now we have something similar for LG WOLED. For context, Optimum has been using an LG UltraGear 32GS95UV monitor for a wide range of uses, from gaming to content creation. I think it's a pretty much identical 4K model to the LG UltraGear 32GS95UE I reviewed here , complete with 1080p dual-mode. It's said the panel has been set to between 80% and 100% brightness depending on the time of day. No aggressive measures were taken to alleviate burn-in besides running Windows in dark mode with the taskbar set to autohide. All of the panel protection settings were left in default mode.

I did, however, get a good round of games in on her last night, here are the things I learned: Her gun is very bad, except for when you're using her Slam Fire ability. Her ult is very good, and has a very short cooldown. As soon as you get her ult in the early game, you can start going ham on people.

    "body": "I use the word \"catastrophic\" quite a lot—it's one of those things that just happens when you write about videogames for a living—but there are few games more deserving of the term than MindsEye , one of 2025's biggest flops. A rough pre-release led into an even worse launch: Player counts on Steam were microscopic, layoffs at developer Build a Rocket Boy followed, and the whole thing was clearly, incontrovertibly, and utterly cooked . And yet. Somehow, here we are with a new update, and a promise of even bigger things to come. As Benoit Blanc famously said, \"It makes no damn sense. Compels me, though.\" \"After months of continued post-launch support following player and critic feedback, the title receives its most significant post-launch update yet, achieving the studio's vision for quality and setting the stage for exciting future content updates,\" BARB said in today's press blast. The studio also promised that, \"over the coming months,\" it will unveil a new expansion adding \"end-game content and enhanced world exploration,\" along with a new multiplayer mode. \"I want to thank everyone who's been playing and sharing feedback, and our dedicated team who have worked incredibly hard …",

    "body": "When I flew down to Blizzard HQ last week to see what the Overwatch 2 team had been cooking for the last few years, I expected a couple of new heroes and an animated cinematic. What I saw was way more than I ever could've imagined, to the point the words \"soft reboot\" came to mind. It isn't quite that, mind you, but it's easily the biggest update the game has ever had and a marked shift in the vision of what it could be. Starting next week on February 10, Overwatch 2 will drop the 2 and launch the first season of a year-long storyline called The Reign of Talon. Vendetta, the gladiator woman who was recently released as a hero , has taken over the terrorist organization at the heart of Overwatch's near-future story, and the rest of 2026 will explore the fallout of her coup. To tell that story, Blizzard has five (five!) new heroes ready to go: Tank hero Domina, damage heroes Anran and Emre, and support heroes Jetpack Cat and Mizuki. Another five heroes are coming before the end of the year at a rate of one per season. All of them will figure in the narrative—via in-game events, short stories, comics, and cinematics—before the arc wraps up and a new storyline begins in 2027. Game dir…",

    "body": "Documents detailing technical aspects of what's thought to be its next-gen Zen 6 CPUs have been posted on AMD's website . The most significant covers AMD's adoption of Intel's so-called 'FRED' interrupt handling. It's a change that implies that Zen 6 could be a major architectural overhaul as opposed to a relatively minor revision. FRED stands for Flexible Return and Event Delivery. At least, that's what it stands for now. No lesser an authority than Linux creator Linus Torvalds has something to say about that, more on which in a moment. It's a replacement for the decades-old IDT or Interrupt Descriptor Table that dates way back to the Intel 286 processor circa 1982. Both FRED and IDT are instructions for how to handle system events, such as a mouse input or the arrival of a network data packet, also known as interrupts. The technicalities are complicated . But to aggressively simplify the subject, with IDT, the smooth handling of these system events requires software developers to manually manage interrupts over several steps to minimise the risk of multiple interrupts conflicting with each other. FRED ditches IDT's multiple manually-implemented instructions in favour of a single…",

There’s no denying that FromSoftware is the king of the genre, but as far as I’m concerned, Nioh 2 deserves a spot on the Mount Rushmore of soulslikes, nestled between Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring. Don’t get me wrong, it’s got its problems. Certain mechanics are a touch obtuse, and you’ll end up traipsing through the same maps at least three times to complete side quests, but that’s easy to handwave when its combat is a head above almost every other soulslike. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) Still, given the improvements between Nioh and Nioh 2, I couldn’t help but feel optimistic about Nioh 3. This is Team Ninja’s third swing at perfecting its own specific formula of action-focused soulslike, and it was already so close with Nioh 2. So has it done it? Is …",

Okay, I definitely wouldn't because I forever suffer from a severe case of imposter syndrome. But Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone doesn't seem to think he's all that of an advanced developer either. Something I found mighty interesting when reading through his interview with IGN for the game's 10-year anniversary is that he still very much thinks of himself as \"a total amateur.\" (Image credit: ConcernedApe) When talking about transitioning from solo development to working on the game with a team, Barone credits his fellow coworkers for their \"unique sensibilities\" and being able to do \"so many things I couldn't have done on my own\" like translating the game into multiple languages and introducing multiplayer. \"There's some technical things that are just beyond my skill level,\" he said. \"I'm a very amateur developer. I still feel that way. I'm just a total amateur.\" When asked about why he feels that way, he said \"I think it's because my approach to devel…",
