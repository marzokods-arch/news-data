    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

Verizon is experiencing a significant outage today, with thousands of users from across the country taking to service availability monitor Downdetector to report that their Verizon service isn’t working. It isn’t just Verizon getting reports, though: AT&amp;T and T-Mobile ‘s outage reports on Downdetector spiked at the same time, along with some other non-carrier online services like Amazon Web Services and Google . Downdetector’s outage report graphs for T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Google, US Cellular, Amazon Web Services, and more all spiked at the same time as Verizon’s, starting just before noon Eastern time today. Reports of Verizon outages far outweighed reports for other services, however: Verizon saw nearly 200,000 reports at the peak of the outage around 12:30 PM, Eastern, while T-Mobile and AT&amp;T each had less than 2,000 reports around the same time.",

The game is an origami simulator called “Kami.” The project is free, available online, and it’s open-source, so anyone can use or modify it. With the extra screen real estate that foldable phones, like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 , provide, they make for great mobile gaming devices. The unique folding design of foldables also presents an opportunity to interact with games in a new way. On that end, we’re starting to see developers find ways to incorporate a folding phone’s hinge into the gameplay, like the viral Foldy Bird game . Now, another game has emerged with a rather clever idea. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Heavy, uncomfortable to wear, and worst of all, featuring a low-res, blurry screen, it coasted by on sheer novelty.

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

The Pixel 10a is rumored to be launching in the next few weeks. We first saw unofficial renders of the Pixel 10a published by Android Headlines back in October . Today, the outlet is back at it with a leak of what it says is the first official render published of Google’s upcoming midranger. There’s nothing surprising in the render itself, but the timing of the leak does line up nicely with a rumor from earlier this morning pointing to a 10a release in the coming weeks. The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different. The phone in the render is sporting some considerably thick bezels, a notable difference from previous (unofficial) CAD renders, which featured a thinner border around the phone’s display.",

You’ll see a special animation if you search for terms related to the anniversary, like “America’s 250th.” This Easter egg will stay around until July 4, 2026. Google often likes to celebrate special occasions by sneaking Easter eggs into Search. So if you happen to search for something that’s related to the Easter egg, you just may be treated to a fun little surprise. For example, back when Wicked was released, you could see your search results float away if you searched for the movie. Now Google has a new surprise waiting for users interested in America’s independence. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In a post on Bluesky, Quandt says that the Pixel 10a will be released in four colorways and two storage configurations “around mid Feb.” It’s been rumored before that the 10a would launch earlier than Google typically releases its A series phones, but this is the first time we’ve heard February, specifically.",
