A Redditor who goes by the handle ashleysaidwhat has apparently attached a pair of trucks to an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5080 . The result is a seemingly workable skateboard, of sorts. \"She's a 5080 Astral but she looks like a 5090, and she handles like a TUF,\" is all the poster has to say. The rest is Reddit history and presumably a future podcast series. Was the RTX 5080 already bricked? Hopefully. Is it now completely toast as an actual GPU? Almost certainly. Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket. Likewise, the PCIe connector with all the electrical contact points isn't visible and, as you can see from the official Asus image below, it sticks out quite a lot in reality.

In a statement to the press, Rockstar claimed the fired employees were \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" These explanations did not wash with the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB)—a trade union focused on organising precarious and under-unionised sectors of employment—which accused Rockstar of \"the most brazen act of union busting the games industry has ever seen.\" The IWGB says that, contrary to Rockstar's allegations of leaking company secrets, the only outsiders the employees were speaking to were union organisers.

Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\". Say, for example, the 'three, two, one' audio cue that often comes with AddOns like Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). That's per an interview game director Ion Hazzikostas had with the authors of two major mods, Bigwigs and DBM.

But now, thanks to the games' new update, there's a lot more for you to navigate. I naively thought that the only hurdle we'd have to overcome as part of this update were the spiders teased in the trailer. Even then, I didn't think they'd spawn as frequently as they do. But my God, having now forced my partner to navigate the perils of the Roots update with me, I've seen that there is actually a lot more than just spiders and the standard status effects to worry about. Climbing through Roots is not for the faint of heart. The first challenge is the environment itself, as you have to rely on vines and bouncy mushrooms to get where you need to go.

Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices. Many popular DDR5 kits have seen prices essentially double since August. By way of example, take the Crucial Pro 32 GB DDR5 RAM Kit . It was $83 in August. Now it's $…",

You'll need a specific item to spawn in your run, not to mention requiring you to actually find the item on your adventure, which is often easier said than done. Luckily, it's not locked to a biome, so given you're making good progress, your chances of tracking it down are slightly higher, but there's no way to guarantee when or where it'll pop up. You'll also only be able to unlock this badge by playing with someone else, as the item requires at least two players to make the most of.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it . Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted landed with a sub-50% \"mixed\" rating on Steam, quite a contrast to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating the old GOTY Edition holds. I created the music in Plants vs. Zombies with the specific intention of it being dynamic. Instruments gradually appear to match the intensity of zombies & prevent audio fatigue.Replanted Level 1-1: ALL THE DRUMS RIGHT AWAYYears later + bigg…",

And, I suppose, some of you might also have your fingers crossed for Fallout: New Vegas 2. You probably shouldn't hold your breath waiting for it to happen, though. In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things. The hangup is that after years of making games based on other people's properties—KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Dungeon Siege 3, South Park: The Stick of Truth—Obsidian is apparently having a pretty good time doing its own thing. \"I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, when’s the next New Vegas?
