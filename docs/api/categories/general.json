This lets you broadcast Bluetooth audio or tune into Bluetooth broadcasts from others. It also comes months after Google introduced Auracast support on Pixels, but only for compatible hearing aids. Google announced Auracast support for the Pixel 9 series earlier this year, but this was initially restricted to compatible hearing aids . Now, the company has announced full-fledged Auracast support for recent Pixel phones . Auracast is part of the Bluetooth LE Audio standard, and this feature allows you to broadcast Bluetooth audio or tune into Bluetooth audio broadcasts from others. This means you don‚Äôt have to give one earbud to a friend if you want to listen to music together, as you can broadcast the audio to multiple pairs of earbuds and headphones. This is also useful for situations like sightseeing, as the guide or establishment can broadcast audio to your existing Bluetooth earphones. Google also points to examples like staying informed at the airport or listening to TV at the gym.",

Until now, Maps only appeared as a small arrow notification on your Pixel Watch that required tapping to expand.

If you‚Äôve ever started walking or cycling directions on your phone and squinted at a tiny arrow on your wrist, this one‚Äôs for you. Google Maps on Pixel Watch is being updated so that navigation no longer sits as a small notification you have to tap. It will now expand to the full-screen Maps view on your watch automatically. Google says the change is part of the latest Pixel Drop and will kick in whenever you begin walking or bike navigation on your phone. In other words, start the route on your handset, and your watch jumps straight to the full-screen Maps interface with turn-by-turn guidance, with no extra taps or phone juggling required.",
