    "body": "TL;DR Google has published new promo videos for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro. The Pixel 10 clip is classic Google, criticizing Apple fans for their “vanilla” choices. The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Background The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has reviewed flight, ground test, and published data on ultraviolet-induced degradation of silicone based thermal control coatings. Analysis has shown, for at least one silicone coating, that bake-out plays an important role in ultraviolet (UV) degradation, indicating that UV interaction with paint volatiles, and not the structural material, is the primary source of coating discoloration. Discussion Spacecraft temperature is primarily determined by the absorptivity and emissivity of the vehicle’s coating. Absorptivity is the fraction of the sun’s irradiance that is absorbed, and emissivity determines the amount of infrared power that is emitted. The combination of these properties, along with additional heat from internal sources and other external radiation sources, determines the spacecraft’s thermal environment. Choosing an appropriate coating, referred to as a thermal control coating, is key to keeping the vehicle within a desired temperature range. However, these coatings can degrade, (i.e., darken), in low earth orbit (LEO), primarily due to solar UV exposure, complicating the choice of coating. Zinc-oxide (ZnO) scatte…",

It also signaled a deeper partnership with one of the most influential independent promoters in the U.S.: Mammoth Concerts. Challenger Artists, co-founded by Marek and Wiedel in late 2024, is built around the kind of artist-first ethos both developed in the Kansas City scene. Wiedel, who has spent nearly a decade as a Mammoth talent buyer, and Marek, who previously managed artists through Backbeat Management, joined forces after Marek left her former firm and brought breakout indie act The Wrecks with her. Soon after, the pair struck an agreement with Mammoth that allowed them to launch a management arm within the larger company’s infrastructure.

How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool. Today we’re checking out one small way that Google could make this screen-searching solution even more streamlined.

The audio device has a feature called the “energy slider.” It’s currently unknown what this slider does. Nothing’s sub-brand, CMF, began teasing its first-ever pair of headphones last week. Called the Headphone Pro , there’s not much known about the device yet, other than you’ll be able to customize it with different earpad colors. With the launch only a week away, the company has now shared a new detail about its upcoming audio product. Similar to Nothing’s Headphone 1 , the CMF Headphone Pro will have an assortment of differently-shaped buttons and controls. Among those controls is a feature that looks a lot like a volume slider. However, it appears this slider may not be for controlling volume, as the company calls the feature an “energy slider.”",

One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years.
