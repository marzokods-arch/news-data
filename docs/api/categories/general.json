The Grammy-winning Australian trio has been recognised for delivering the highest-selling electronic tour of all time, following a record-breaking run of global dates on their Inhale / Exhale World Tour . The group was presented with a commemorative plaque in Sydney this week by Live Nation and Untitled Group, celebrating the milestone after the tour moved 750,000 headline tickets and reached 1.5 million fans worldwide across festivals and headline shows in 2025. The Australia and New Zealand leg marked a peak moment for the band’s touring footprint. More than 180,000 tickets were sold across Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Auckland — all of which fully sold out. The trio also became the highest-selling Australian act ever at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena and set a new all-time attendance record at Auckland’s Outer Fields at Western Springs, drawing 25,000 fans. The Inhale / Exhale era has been a commercial and critical standout for the group.

From No. 1 singles to record-breaking tours, four Grammy wins for album of the year, and more accolades galore, her latest single “The Fate of Ophelia” from The Life of a Showgirl recently tied her longest leader on the Billboard Hot 100 , Midnights ’ “Anti-Hero,” for the most weeks on top with eight. It’s important to note that Swift has a hand in writing all of her catalog – despite some accusations to the contrary . And throughout her career, a plethora of co-writers have worked with the pop superstar, including Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, Aaron Dessner, Liz Rose, Lana Del Rey, Florence Welch and even Zoe Kravitz, among many others. But she’s also written a number of songs — 67 to be exact — all on her own. In fact, 10 of her 12 studio albums all have at least one song where she’s the only writer – Reputation and The Life of a Showgirl are the only two that don’t – and her third studio album, Speak Now , is even comprised entirely of works she wrote alone.

Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it.

The S26 Ultra could retain its 6.9-inch QHD screen and quad-camera setup, but may upgrade to a new M14 OLED panel for improved efficiency. Samsung’s upcoming flagship lineup has been leaking for months, and if you were hoping the Galaxy S26 series would reinvent the wheel, you might want to lower your expectations.

Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",
