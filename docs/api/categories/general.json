It has a slick UI, built-in cloud saves, RetroAchievements support, and an easy setup process. The app is downloadable for free today, with a Play Store release coming very soon. If you’ve ever dabbled in the world of emulation, you know how quickly your collection can get out of hand. Emulation frontends help keep things nice and organized, but a new app called NeoStation goes above and beyond what traditional frontends like ES DE and Beacon offer, with a plethora of unique features. NeoStation, the brainchild of solo dev Miguel Soto, just hit beta with a slick new UI redesign. After a quick, easy setup (you have to delete the app if you have an older version), it displays all the games on your system, including Android games and apps on mobile devices.",

This could be very useful for many users, but also raises performance concerns due to Chrome’s resource usage. The feature doesn’t seem to be widely available in Chrome Canary yet, but we’re guessing this is a gradual release. Google Chrome is the world’s most popular web browser on PCs, but it also has a reputation for being a resource hog. Now, Google has implemented a toggle that’s convenient in theory, but also means the browser can suck up resources as soon as you start your computer. Chrome expert Leopeva64 reported on Twitter that Chrome Canary now offers an Open Chrome when my computer starts toggle on Windows. The toggle, which is apparently off by default but functional, opens a Chrome window as soon as you boot up your PC. The toggle can be found by tapping Settings &gt; On startup &gt; Open Chrome when my computer starts . Check out a screenshow below, via the tipster.",

OnePlus drew the ire of some enthusiasts last week when it emerged that new firmware for select devices introduced Anti-Rollback Protection (ARB). This hardware-level protection measure means users would brick their devices if they tried to downgrade the software or install a custom ROM. Fortunately, OnePlus has revealed that this isn’t a permanent state of affairs. OnePlus told Android Authority in an emailed response that this was a temporary measure to boost security:",

You will be able to buy it starting later this week through Samsung’s online and select offline stores in the US. The TriFold’s 512GB variant is priced at $2,899. The recently unveiled Galaxy Z TriFold is an impressive piece of technology. While the design and the heft may feel less practical than a standard book-style foldable, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the limitations are easily offset by its utility. The TriFold is essentially a large Android tablet that fits in your pocket, and it may be the perfect device if you fancy using three apps side-by-side. And if you’re in the US and have been waiting to lay your hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, we have good news. As promised , Samsung is officially bringing the Galaxy Z TriFold to the US, and eager customers will be able to buy it starting Friday, January 30. The pricing for the Galaxy Z TriFold with 512GB storage is set at $2,899, and it will be available through Samsung’s online and offline retail stores. The Korean market also gets a 1TB variant, so we hope to hear a bit more about its availability in the US.",

The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access.

You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",
