He brought bachata megastar Romeo Santos to the stage, where they sang &#8220;BOKeTE.&#8221; Two weeks later, the Puerto Rican superstar made his way to San José, Costa Rica&#8217;s Estadio Nacional, where he invited Jhayco as a guest star. Most recently, Bad Bunny took his tour to Mexico City, where an overwhelming demand for tickets transformed his originally scheduled two shows into an impressive eight nights. From Dec. 10–21, the sold-out concerts drew more than 520,000 fans to Estadio GNP Seguros, according to figures from the promoter Ocesa. The Puerto Rican chart-topper performed a nearly three-hour stadium set, transitioning between the main platform and the Puerto Rico-inspired “casita” before returning to wrap up the performance. During the concert series, he brought out a handful of acts, including Tex-Mex band Grupo Frontera , Colombian powerhouses Feid and J Balvin , corridos tumbados pioneer Natanael Cano and beloved Mexican singer-songwrite…",

King of Dancehall Vybz Kartel rang in the year with his blockbuster Freedom Street comeback concert and his very first Billboard cover , marking the return of one of the Caribbean&#8217;s biggest stars. Although the &#8220;Fever&#8221; singer did not take home his first Grammy for Party With Me , he did spend 2025 playing his first U.S. shows in 20 years , winning the MOBO impact award, and launching his globe-trotting Worl&#8217; Boss Tour .

Just a mere 4% of all Hot 100 No. 1s dating to the chart’s launch on Aug. 4, 1958, have earned the achievement. Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical” flexed 10 weeks at No. 1 in 1981-82, and that smash and Boone’s shared the mark for the longest Hot 100 reign for more than a decade, until Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” dominated for 13 weeks in 1992. That best lasted briefly, as Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” led for 14 weeks in late 1992/early 1993. In 1995-96, Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s “One Sweet Day” ran up 16 weeks at No. 1, a milestone that held for more than 23 years. (Songs began logging longer No. 1 stays after the Hot 100 adopted electronically tracked data, according to Luminate, in late 1991.) In 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber, tied the No. 1 run of “One Sweet Day.” By 2019, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, collected 19 weeks atop the Hot 100, a mark matched by Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” beginning in July 2024.
