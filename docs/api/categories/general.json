In songs such as Karol G’s “Milagros,” Bad Bunny’s “Estamos Bien” and “Bendecido” by Dale Pututi and Gente de Zona&#8217;s Randy Malcom, the artists share sentiments about feeling at peace, being blessed in their personal lives and having successful careers. Beéle’s “Algo Bueno,” Elena Rose’s “La De Dios,” and Yami Safdie and Camilo’s “Querida Yo,” on the other hand, are tracks that reflect on self-love, evolution and the importance of manifestation because the best is yet to come. “Evil wants to trap me, but it won&#8217;t succeed/ I have angels protecting me, where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way/ It&#8217;s never too late to be reborn/ You will always see the best part of me,&#8221; Beéle sings on his smooth Afrobeats track.

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

The phone has a slick design and a well-rounded spec sheet, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chip and triple 50MP rear cameras. The Signature also offers seven years of updates and access to exclusive experiences. We first heard about an apparent Motorola Signature phone last month. Fortunately, we didn’t have to wait long for the unveiling, as Motorola has just launched the device. The Motorola Signature is the first phone in the brand’s new Signature series, and it emphasizes a slick design and premium extras. Starting with the design, Moto says the phone is 6.99mm thick and has an aluminum frame. The Signature is available in Pantone Martini Olive with a twill-inspired finish, or Pantone Carbon with a linen-inspired finish. Motorola’s phone also packs Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection and IP68/69 ratings.",

    "body": "The operating system that powers every Android phone and tablet on the market is based on AOSP , short for the Android Open Source Project. Google develops and releases AOSP under the permissive Apache 2.0 License, which allows any developer to use, modify, and distribute their own operating systems based on the project without paying fees or releasing their own modified source code. Since beginning the project, Google released the source code for nearly every new version of Android for mobile devices, typically doing so within days of rolling out the corresponding update to its own Pixel mobile devices. Starting this year, however, Google is making a major change to its release schedule for Android source code drops: AOSP sources will only be released twice a year. Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4. The reason is to ensure platform stability for the Android ecosystem and better align with Android’s trunk-stable development model . Developers navigating to source.android.com today will see a banner confirming the change that reads as follows:",
