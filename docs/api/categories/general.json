After relying on Google’s Wear OS for nearly a decade, it is switching to a custom interface to fix connectivity issues with the iPhone. TAG Heuer went a step further, securing a “Made for iPhone” certification for the smartwatch. Google’s Wear OS has been the choice of interface for several generations of TAG Heuer Connected series smartwatches. However, the luxury watchmaker is changing that with the latest generation of the series, replacing Wear OS with a custom operating system that plays well with the iPhone. TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.

Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025.

Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors.

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add?
