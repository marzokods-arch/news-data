    "body": "A new study conducted for the Wisconsin Center District has recommended the demolition of the 117-year-old Miller High Life Theatre in Milwaukee. The report, which was conducted by real estate development strategy firm Hunden Partners, states that the District could be attracting significantly more business if the area had another hotel located near the recently renovated Baird Center – specifically in the location where the Miller High Life Theatre stands. According to the proposal, the theater – which is owned by the WCD and operated by independent promoter Pabst Theater Group – was recommended for demolition because it will be &#8220;threatened with the new Live Nation venue” that is currently being built nearby on the same campus as the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks arena, Fiserv Forum. The proposal argues the two theaters will saturate the market.

The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following that early look last month, nationwide sales of the E10 platform are opening today. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",

    "body": "The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is widely tipped to launch at the end of the month, but leaks suggest that the cheapest model will get mostly iterative upgrades. That’s bad news for those who want a flagship Galaxy without spending Ultra money. The cheaper Galaxy A56 5G isn’t a better option, either, as it gains a larger battery but loses out on performance, flexible cameras, wireless charging, and more. However, colleague Andrew Grush recently got his daughter a Galaxy S25 FE and subsequently wondered why he bothered with flagships. Between this article and my own time with the phone last year, I realized that the Galaxy S25 FE is actually Samsung’s best-kept secret today.",

I do have some serious complaints, though. My biggest issue is the lack of ports, but I also found that it requires a factory reset every year or two due to significant performance problems. Acer announced the Acer 4K UHD Google TV Streaming Box in South Africa late last year, and this looked like the answer to my prayers. This Google TV box is made by prominent ODM SEI Robotics, but a closer look revealed that it easily met my requirement for more ports. This theoretically means I can plug in my portable hard drive for no-frills local media playback, or easily plug in a flash drive to transfer APKs. I recently splashed out on the Acer TV box and, after using it for roughly six weeks, here are my thoughts on making the switch.",

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears.

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

A new report now reveals how big a financial hit Disney’s sports broadcasting arm suffered due to the blackout. ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Only corporate-owned stores are participating; third-party outlets won’t have the freebies. The platter features a T-Mobile logo and appears to have moderate capacity for snacks or party treats. T-Mobile Tuesdays is T-Mobile’s wildly popular loyalty program, and the occasional freebies pair very well with T-Mobile’s deals and plans. T-Mobile gave away a cozy magenta blanket in December, and for February, the company plans to give away a football-shaped food platter. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s only been a week since Eden improved Nintendo Switch emulation on Android in its latest update, but now the other major alternative has pushed brand new features to PC. Citron’s “Pathfinder” update dropped over the weekend, and although it’s mostly focused on PC and Steam Deck performance, it has bug fixes and updates across all platforms. One of the biggest and most unique new features in the update is save management. This allows you to choose where your save games live, back them up, import them, and even use them in other Switch emulators like Eden or old-school Yuzu. This can be set globally or on a per-game basis.",

Google is therefore continuing to drop new features in Gemini to entice users, and is now testing three new features. But in addition to adding new features for users, Google may also be looking to simply replace another chatbot with Gemini. Out of the features Google is currently testing in Gemini, the most compelling appears to be the ability to import chats from other AI chatbots while retaining all information and media shared in those chats. Alexey Shabanov of TestingCatalog has discovered a new “Import AI Chats” option in Gemini’s attachment menu. As expected, this solution is geared towards helping users switch from competing platforms, such as ChatGPT , Claude, or Microsoft Copilot.",

Under the hood, Amazon’s smart displays pack similar specifications as mainstream Android devices. For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1. However, Amazon has never permitted unlocking the bootloader on its smart displays, keeping us locked to the Alexa-centric Fire OS ecosystem.",

There are no concrete plans yet, and this phone may not arrive anytime soon. Apple has a few new form factors that it has long reported to be working on. The most buzzworthy is the iPhone Fold , which is expected to debut alongside the iPhone 18 later at Apple’s yearly September event. Much before its launch, the iPhone Fold is already shaping trends with its unusual “wider” aspect ratio and driving Android brands to adopt the same . Apple’s next foldable, however, could be far more conventional. While the first Apple foldable has yet to hit the shelves, the industry is buzzing with speculation about the second.
