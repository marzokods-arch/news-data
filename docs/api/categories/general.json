The Australian music icon, 76, was photographed with family over the Christmas period in images shared by his sons on social media. One photo, posted by son Rob Farnham on Facebook, showed the singer seated at a table surrounded by family on Boxing Day, smiling alongside his wife, Jill. “Boxing Day shenanigans,” the caption read. A second image, shared on Instagram by Farnham’s other son, James Farnham , featured a similar family gathering with the caption, “Merry Christmas from the Farnhams.” View this post on Instagram The appearances mark Farnham’s first public glimpse since early 2025, when he attended a birthday celebration for his wife.

Farnham underwent a 12-hour surgery that required the removal of parts of his mouth and jaw, followed by eight weeks of radiation treatment.

Regional Mexican hitmaker Netón Vega was February&#8217;s Latin Artist of the Rise of 2025, and it’s safe to say he went on to have an extraordinary year. The Baja California Sur singer-songwriter earned the title of new artist of the year at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards and dropped two albums this year, his debut Mi Vida Mi Muerte in February and Delirium last month. Furthermore, he scored the No. 1 spot on Billboard ‘s New Latin Artists of 2025 list .
