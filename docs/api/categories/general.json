The flare pictured was classified as an X4.2 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. SDO measures the Sun’s properties and solar activity to help us better understand the Sun’s magnetic changes. By studying flares and how they affect our planet and nearby space, SDO helps us to better prepare for and deal with these potential disruptions. Image credit: NASA/SDO",

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air.

ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, R. J. Foley (UC Santa Cruz), Dark Energy Survey/DOE/FNAL/DECam/CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA; Acknowledgment: Mehmet Yüksek This new Hubble image, released on Jan. 30, 2026, is the sharpest taken of NGC 7722, a lenticular galaxy located about 187 million light-years away in the constellation&nbsp;Pegasus. A lenticular, meaning “lens-shaped,” galaxy is a type whose classification sits between more familiar&nbsp;spiral galaxies&nbsp;and&nbsp;elliptical galaxies. It is also less common than spirals and ellipticals — partly because these galaxies have a somewhat ambiguous appearance, making it hard to determine if it is a spiral, an elliptical, or something in between.
