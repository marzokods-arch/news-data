Cleveland Browns players unfamiliar with the song&nbsp; liked what they heard &nbsp;when it was played last week. Giggs has done collaborations with artists including Drake, 21 Savage, Ed Sheeran and Dave.

No other details were immediately available, and representatives for Keaton did not immediately respond to inquiries. The unexpected news was met with shock around the world. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her “La-dee-da, la-dee-da” phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family. Her star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades thanks in part to a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Nancy Meyers.
