One of these quirks is the map system, or rather, the seeming lack of it. It's definitely not uncommon for exploration-focused platformers to have obscure or downright useless maps, but for a while Silksong seems like it might not even have one at all. Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them. It's going to make early exploration a lot more …",

    "body": "In an interview with PC Gamer earlier this year, Eric Barone, beloved creator of Stardew Valley, mused that he might need to go hole up in a cabin in the woods to be able to fully focus on making his next game, Haunted Chocolatier . Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

My first stop after booting up the game was the options menu, and I found some pleasant surprises there. As a 2D action game without need for features like DLSS or ray tracing, Silksong has the key features we'd hope for and some nices bonuses, too. And yes, it's Steam Deck Verified . ✅ Hollow Knight: Silksong's graphics settings (Image credit: Team Cherry) Aspect ratio support: 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 Screen modes: Fullscreen, Windowed, Borderless Windowed V-Sync: On / Off Particle effects: Normal / Low Blur quality: High / Low Framerate cap: 30 / 60 / 120 / 144 / 165 / Off While there aren't beefy graphics options to \"crank up\" here, we're happy to see 21:9 ultrawide support and 16:10, the aspect ratio used by the Steam Deck.

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

    "body": "My favourite builds are the ones where you know someone asked if they could, and wasted no more time asking if they should —they just went for it. Enter this homebrew ultrawide handheld that practically encourages backseat gaming. Made by BiliBili user PureDIY , the handheld features the improbable aspect ratio of 32:9. The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds. Throw in detachable controllers alongside a touch screen, and I can't quite tear my eyes away from this DIY project. As fun as this build is, I very much doubt ultrawide handhelds are a concept that will go mainstream. For one thing, how would you st…",

Well, now Valve has trademarked \"Steam Frame\" a new brand for use with gaming consoles and peripherals. The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project. But if you take it at face value, there's a good chance Valve is indeed planning some kind of console and it's going to be known as the Steam Frame.

This week I've been: planning builds for every single skill tree in Borderlands 4, hoping it would help me pick a character, but actually leaving me more conflicted. Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore. Perhaps best of all, the new Wildcard Missions are full of potential. You'll need to complete these capstone challenges to…",

But with how good the MMO apparently is (82% positive on Steam !) it's a wonder you don't hear more about it, right? I'm not the only one who thinks so. In a chat with PCGamesN , Zenimax studio game director Rich Lambert said the low profile of TESO is \"the biggest chip on my shoulder.\" Lambert—who served as TESO's director in a previous life—says the game is \"either not taken seriously or dismissed or whatnot\" and that fact has \"always kind of befuddled me.\" Worse than that, though: Lambert says it's not all that uncommon to run into people who aren't even aware the game is out, 11 years on from release. \"I've been in countless interviews and at countless shows over the years where they're like 'Oh, when does this come out?' It's been out for years!\" Lambert has a theory as to why that happens, though. He reckons it's because the team doesn't \"trumpet\" the game all that much…",

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",

    "summary": "While some critics find a rewarding balancing act in Cronos combat, others say it obstructs an otherwise fascinating setting.",
    "body": "The last year's been a big one for Bloober Team: The Polish studio's releasing its second survival horror outing in less than 12 months. As a follow-up to the success of the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos: The New Dawn sees Bloober Team stretching its legs in a new setting featuring time travel, soul harvesting, and an exciting new noun for referring to zombies when just saying \"zombies\" feels a little passé. With review embargoes lifting today, critics have been sharing their thoughts—and so far, our own Cronos review is among the more critical. While we eventually enjoyed the ideas explored in its time-twisting story, we found the amount of mandated zombie killing—sorry, \"orphan\" killing—slowed things to a slog. Other takes, however, share a much rosier view of Nowa Huta and its post-apocalyptic charms. Here's what Cronos reviews are saying elsewhere. \"An atmospheric and uniquely introspective adventure for those who value a game's story as much as its action.\" GamesRadar : 3.5 / 5 For Ashley Bardhan at GamesRadar, Cronos: The New Dawn's greatest success is its atmosphere. Despite the clear inspirations from genre landmarks like Dead Space, Resident Evil, and Silent Hill, Bardhan …",

    "summary": "An extremely snackable combination of fun roguelite powers and snappy first-person shooting.",
    "body": "Abyssus is the sort of game you play and, within an hour, go \"huh, why aren't there like, a hundred more of these?\" Despite a thousand multiplayer first-person shooters and a million more roguelites crowding Steam, stick the two together and you've got a peanut butter and chocolate combo that surprisingly few developers have decided to take advantage of. Abyssus adds a special ingredient of its own to the pairing: sea salt. The deep sea diver aesthetic of the FPS roguelike has a slight \"we have BioShock at home\" feel to it for a few minutes, but that dissipates once you're firing a WW1-era repeater or a crackling Tesla gun at towering Aztec-influenced ancient gods who in return assault you with waves and laser beams. Abyssus is a lithe shooter: you've got a dash and a double-jump right from the start, and enemies like divebombing exploding sharks encourage constant dancing around its battle arenas. Bosses bust out \"floor is lava\" moves and expanding rings of crackling damage that at times evoke MMO raid bosses or bullet hell patterns. They're overwhelming the first time, but learnable enough that subsequent runs make them familiar puzzles to dance through while focusing on how you…",

    "body": "Hollow Knight came out eight years ago. I barely remember what happened last week let alone what a game I played almost a decade ago was about. With Silksong finally coming out, that's a problem—and maybe it is for you, too. Thankfully, YouTube has us covered, and you won't need several hours to get caught up. Any veteran of the last-minute lore video binge will know that there are always two paths to take: You can either sit down and prepare to watch the big comprehensive explainer or blast through a condensed one and call it good. How you want to spend your time is up to you. I generally stick to shorter videos if I've already played the game and longer ones if I'm completely new. I've got a recommendation for both types of video and I'll leave it up to you which one you want to check out. The best long Hollow Knight lore video (1 hour 17 minutes) Most fans agree that there's one creator to watch for a complete explanation of Hollow Knight's lore and story: Mossbag . At a little over an hour, their video summarizes the history of Hallownest, what unfolds as you play through the game, and what all the endings mean. The whole thing is structured chronologically, which means even s…",
