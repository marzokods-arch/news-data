Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair. Ok, maybe that's a bit much, but you've got to establish a bit of a grimdark mood for a Warhammer quiz, right? And I really do think this is one of my hardest yet. Even as a Warhammer superfan, remembering all the different games from across the franchise's wilderness years is no small feat. (Image credit: Saber Interactive) I've made some concessions, at least. I've mostly trimmed out the mobile ports, endless card games, and other random nonsense—so you don't have to remember the short-lived existence of Warhammer: Arcane Magic, for example.

These include several natural phenomena like aquifers and geothermal fields, which you can exploit with discoverable tech like geothermal engines and aquifer drills. Other objects being introduced are more hazardous, like brambles that can harm your beavers when they try to clear them, and unstable cores that might explode should your beavers approach too closely.

It is a small, severe world that quickly charmed me. While all rhythm games are about timing, time writ large, which you have a little less of by now, is Hyperbeat's foremost obsession. One hub NPC is a musician who longs for their bygone depression, if only because it was a source of inspiration in the days before their \"flop era.\" Another is a churlish artist whose precious moments are wasted fretting over the feedback of an audience (or talking to you, for that matter).

That testing phase is rapidly approaching its end, however, as PP has announced its survival roguelike will arrive in early access on November 20. For the uninitiated, Prologue: Go Wayback is a deceptively simple game about hiking from a cabin in the woods to a distant weather tower, where each run is completely unique thanks to maps generated by the studio's homebrewed machine-learning technology. Normally generative AI use is a huge no from me, but PP's systems are built in-house, created using publicly available data and used only to generate the game's hyper-realistic terrain, which is then supplemented by more traditional procgen systems and 3D art. I remain sceptical about the functional benefits the ML tech brings, but it's a more nuanced use-case than a studio trying to replace human workers with ChatGPT or whatever. As for the game …",

Best of 7 provides players with more space to let their builds breathe and, of course, make those incredible comebacks. Thank you for all of the thoughtful feedback.\" The initial change was done as a bit of an experiment. The devs wanted to see if switching the structure up could solve complaints from players that, past round five, matches would snowball with powers and items becoming too strong for players to handle. And it did just that. Not only were Stadium games faster with the best-of-five format, but with less time for teams to purchase tonnes of expensive …",

Few properly achieve that, happy to focus on just one area while abstracting away others. But the grand strategy genre is always about expanding the view, incorporating into its wargame roots systems of politics, economics and culture. Europa Universalis 5 widens the frame again, adding a new wrinkle: People. It's nothing less than an attempt at simulating the world for centuries with a fidelity beyond anything else in the genre. You play as the controlling force behind a country over 500 years of history, 1337 to 1836, using the same mechanical simulation to present both the late medieval and the entirety of the early modern period.

Jerry O'Flaherty, art director on the original Deus Ex, gave his reaction to the remaster during a recent sit-down with FRVR . It did not seem positive. \"Oh, what the fuck,\" said O'Flaherty. \"No. This did not need to happen. Sorry whoever was involved in this. Oh man, yeah, no.\" So not exactly a thumbs-up, there. Still, O'Flaherty does—sort of—get a bit more positive. \"If you’re gonna do it, yeah, alright, why not? Why am I judging?\" Which is less approval so much as it is resignation to the whims of fate. I can't fault the guy. Deus Ex was never a graphical powerhouse, but it had a vibe and a cohesive aesthetic all the way back in the year 2000. \"You wanted to lean into what the engine did well and don’t do the shit that it doesn’t do well,\" said O'Flaherty. The remaster, as we've seen it so far, trades all that in for a slapdash up-rezzing of everything, making the game too bright, too bulky, and strangely even more archaic-looking than it did originally.

Narrative twists and turns follow, leading through a story that's not especially novel but still manages to deliver surprises. A lot of that arises from your freedom to make a mess of things: Your in-game avatar isn't the most hard-charging videogame hero imaginable, and there are many ways to die, most of them awful. The game itself is also surprisingly gross for an isometric point-and-clicker. (Which I mean as a compliment.) So it's a good time!

One YouTuber, Macho Nacho Productions (via Hackaday ), is such a big fan of this aesthetic that they've decided to build their own version, complete with a custom-milled aluminium chassis and the original Xbox internals, albeit with some light upgrades to bring it slightly more into the modern age.. To try and get an understanding of the specific size of the prototype Xbox, Macho Nacho found an image with a Microsoft Sidewinder game pad next to it that was captured at some point in the early 2000s. After comparing a 3D rendering of the two side by side, they then decided that it wasn't quite accurate enough. Macho Nacho took a trip out to New York to see a prototype in a display case, where they took pictures of that case from many angles and sent them to a 3D modeller, where they then created a Gaussian Splat.

Since then we've been waiting to see where his performance would land on a scale from total trainwreck to \"okay, I guess,\" which really felt like the best we could hope for from a major recast four seasons deep. Credit to Hemsworth, his performance is indeed: Fine. As if by design, the season's writing stuffs Geralt behind the rest of his adventuring party where he can't commit the sin of being memorable, even for being great, however unlikely that would have been. The Witcher season 4 begins with a set of flashbacks recapping the series so far, sliding Hemsworth into retellings of old scenes as if he'd been there all along. It's a weird first gambit—Netflix attempting to swap the dead goldfish on us even though we've known this was coming for years. It was initially a bit uncanny as I kept trying to peer through the white wig, yellow eyes, grizzled stubble, and superhero silhouette to remember that yeah, that sure is a similar but different buff Hollywood guy.

The point is, there are too many for any normal person to commit to reading. Fortunately, you don't have to. That number includes a lot of extremely skippable short story anthologies, and multiple novels so tangential you won't miss anything if you don't read them. If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change. If you'd like to spend years of your life reading books where that hope is snuffed out like a candle by a galaxy of darkness, that's …",

You'll need it for making potions as part of the Halloween event, and while most ingredients are easy to find, this one isn't so straightforward. Unlike the other event plants, you'll have a few extra steps to follow before you can pluck these strange flowers and throw them into the cauldron. It's one of five resources added exclusively for Halloween, and seems to be the most common ingredient among the new recipes. Since I've been farming candy like mad to trade for the Witch class , I'm painfully familiar with how to get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest and here to provide a guided tour through the forest. How get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest Before you can pick Stareweed, you'll need to grow it, so collect 10 flowers and find the Fairy's house on your map. She sells one pack of Stareweed Seeds (and other Halloween plants) for 10 flowers a bag—bring 50 if you want to save yourself a trip buying the other seeds. Wait a night or two after the Fairy has sprinkled the seeds, and you should see a notification at the start of the day announcing your Stareweed is growi…",
