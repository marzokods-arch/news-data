    "summary": "Though there’s much potential in the idea of higher-priced streaming tiers, they come with problems and pitfalls, experts say.",
    "body": "More than halfway through 2025, Spotify and other Western music streaming platforms have yet to launch a much-anticipated “superfan” or “super-premium” tier, prompting questions about the delays and speculation about what features will be bundled together in a higher-priced offering. One option was ruled out on Wednesday (Sept. 11) when Spotify announced the arrival of high-quality, lossless audio as a standard perk for subscribers. Named HiFi, the audio offering was first announced in 2020 but was rarely mentioned by Spotify executives in the years since. A few years ago, HiFi might have seemed like a sensible part of a high-priced tier targeted at super-users. But today, better audio quality has become a regular feature rather than a separate perk. Amazon Music began offering lossless audio in 2019 for no extra charge with the launch of Amazon Music HD. Apple Music did the same when it debuted Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio in 2021.

My dad has had [the guitar] for a while, and it wasn&#8217;t about maybe two months ago, he said, ‘Hey, you need to take this home.’ So ever since I&#8217;ve had it, I&#8217;ve been using it. To be playing the Opry, I thought it was appropriate.” On the La Porte, Texas native’s (just southeast of Houston) second album When I Write The Song , out today (Sept. 12) on Big Loud Texas, Worthington also brings bit of history to the fore, with his throwback sound that feels pulled directly from dusty honky-tonks and barrooms that inspired Texas country greats such as George Jones and Willie Nelson.
