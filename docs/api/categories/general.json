    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR A new Android banking Trojan called Herodotus mimics human behavior, such as random keystroke delays, to evade detection tools. The malware employs device-takeover tactics, including the abuse of accessibility services, overlay attacks, and SMS interception. Fraud and security systems that rely only on input rhythm or speed may struggle to catch Herodotus, making deeper device-environment monitoring vital. Update, October 29, 2025 (11:03 AM ET): Google has reached out to Android Authority concerning this report, and a spokesperson shares a comment: Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",

The option works alongside the Touch &amp; hold option that also lets you select symbols, but by long-pressing a key. Google has been testing various ways to make typing on Android devices feel as effortless as possible. In addition to making voice typing much more efficient , Google has been experimenting with several Gboard tweaks, such as auto-switching to the English alphabet after you enter a symbol or punctuation mark. Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2. The feature was spotted rolling out to the beta channel last month, and is now also available on the stable channel, as highlighted by 9to5Google .",

Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile’s app now mentions a “T-Mobile Visa credit card” as an eligible AutoPay payment option. A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device.

Gemini is arriving for Google Home , replacing Assistant as the voice interface we’ll be using to communicate going forward. Earlier this month we saw Google start updating the Home app with Gemini , and ever since we’ve been looking forward to Gemini coming to Google’s smart speakers and screens. Interested users have been able to register for early access, with promises that we’d get our first taste by the end of the month. And today, that’s finally happening.

The two phones share a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 flagship SoC, 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in lieu of last year’s optical scanner.

The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR .
