First off, actually visiting it requires you to unlock Act 3 , which is a whole elaborate process in itself. You'll also have to complete some additional unrelated steps before that. If you hadn't clocked it, this all involves the Green Prince—a mysterious grasshopper (he might be a cricket…) you can rescue in Sinner's Road. Visiting Verdania is related to his overall journey. Obviously, this guide will contain some spoilers for the Act 3 main quest (as far as having to progress it to reach Verdania is concerned), so leave now if you're not there yet. Otherwise, here's how to unlock Verdania as an area and help the Green Prince. How to unlock Verdania in Silksong As mentioned above, you can't get to Verdania until you're in Act 3 , and even then, you'll have to jump through some hoops first. I suggest doing these first three stages during Act 2, because I can't 100% confirm you still can in Act 3.

Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display . This isn't quite the minimap of old, which would give you the exact layout of the area, but it will help you track the exact location of enemies in combat relative to your own position.

As I write this, there's been no official response from Gearbox about the game's technical issues, but it has put out a statement on another complaint that's cropped up, much more rarely but still visible here and there in negative user reviews: Borderlands 4's terms of service. You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

Post-launch patches solve most of the issues in time, but stutters, hitches, and relatively low frame rates are the norm for the series, so my expectations for Borderlands 4's launch performance weren't very high. And sure enough, it needs work. I've tested Borderlands 4 on two gaming PCs: one that just meets the minimum system requirements ( Core i7 9700K , Radeon RX 5700 XT , 16 GB DDR4-3200) and one that's a top–end gaming rig ( Ryzen 7 9800X3D , GeForce RTX 5090 , 32 GB DDR5-6400). Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .

Instead of the phase grasp playstyle we've traditionally seen, Vex is actually more like the Beastmaster himself—FL4K—from Borderlands 3. While this new direction makes the best Vex builds in Borderlands 4 harder to pin down, she's got a lot more versatility thanks to it. Below, I'll go over three of the best Vex builds you can make at max level , one for each of her unique skill trees, so you can make the most out of Borderlands 4's Siren. Of course, I'll also go over how these skills all come together with weapons, class mods, and other gear to reach their full potential. Best Vex builds in Borderlands 4 Just like the other Borderlands 4 characters , Vex has three distinct skill trees that bring something new to the table, including an associated unique action skill: Vexcalation : Master kill skills (even without killing enemies) and fire spectral blasts using the Incarnate action skill to focus solely on increasing Vex's power. You won't be using any minions in this build. The Fourth Seal : This skill tree focuses on Vex's reaper and spectre minions using the Dead Ringer action skill, similar…",

But whaddaya know, it turns out it's actually reasonably achievable, as demonstrated by our host, Vik-on (via Videocardz ). While plenty of modders have strapped more memory modules to graphics cards in the past, it's usually been a technical exercise, rather than creating a genuinely useable GPU at the end of it. Vik-on, however, looks to have been able to double the VRAM capacity of their RTX 4090 successfully with relative ease. Key to this achievement is a leaked Nvidia BIOS, which gives our modder the ability to force support for different capacities and amounts of memory modules using Ada-generation chips.

This is a classy case, and, whether it's aimed at pro creators or pro gamers, one that many should consider for their next build—but not without some caveats. The initial draw of the PA401? Real wood. You know you've made it when your PC case was once alive. Each of the slats over the front intake on the PA401 is made from (sustainably sourced) ash with a glossy finish. So glossy, in fact, the grain is far less noticeable compared to the Fractal Design Terra or North. It's almost indistinguishable from plastic unless you're right up to it. Personally, I like it. The understated wood effect fits with the diminutive design across the rest of the case. But other members of the PC Gamer team thought it needed a little more pizazz. Altogether a simple case to build into, the ProArt stands out for the smaller details.

    "body": "I tend to approach robot videos with a mild air of defeat and scepticism, in no small part because a lot of hype has been generated over what has turned out to be just choreographed movements in the past. Not here, though. This little HITTER (HumanoId Table TEnnis Robot) is hitting bona fide table tennis rallies against humans. And yes, that's table tennis, not ping pong; I'm right, you're wrong. Alright, alright, we'll go with 'ping pong'. HITTER, the ping pong-playing robot, comes from researchers at the FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at UC Berkeley . In a recent video (via Techeblog ), it's shown forehanding, backhanding, and smashing ping pong balls with impressive dexterity and, dare I say it, human- like movement. What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements. In particular, as someone who used to play a lot of table tennis and who wasn't awful at it, I was genuinely impressed by how HITTER returns smashes, and also with the return at 0:28 right off the edge of the table. The robot achieves all this thanks to its design which \"employs a hierarchical decomposition …",

    "body": "One of the main things I've heard players talking about since Silksong 's launch is just how difficult it is. I get it. I'm not going to confess which bosses I've been stuck on or just how long it has taken me to get from point A to B, but just know I also feel this struggle. Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think. It's easy to assume this title means the mod will take you back to a time where enemies would only cause you one hit of damage since it markets itself on simply removing double damage.…",

    "body": "Vicious Mockery is one of the most iconic D&D 5e spells—in case you're completely unfamiliar with the system, or just haven't played a bard yet, it's a cantrip that deals 1d4 psychic damage (scaling a bit with your level) and gives enemies disadvantage on their next attack roll. It also lets you insult someone so hard that they just die, which is also the case in Baldur's Gate 3 . Larian went real overboard on the depth and breadth of insults with this singular cantrip—even giving one NPC bespoke, trauma-invoking dunks just to twist the knife even more. But there was a time when these insults were just plain dookie. No, literally. As spotted by our friends over at GamesRadar+ , a recent stream with junior writer Martin Docherty revealed that poor beleaguered studio head Swen Vincke had to tell the BG3 team to tone it down with the scat-based dunking. He recounts a time when he'd collected a bunch of Vicious Mockery insults into a big sheet: \"Swen had a look at them, and he was like: 'Ah. Hm. Why are so many of them about poo?'\" That's one hell of a note to receive. Which, to Docherty and his fellow writers' credit, they took on the chin: \"Interesting. That's an interesting point. …",
