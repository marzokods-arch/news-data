Unexpectedly, Google also released a new accessory specifically built for the Pixel 10 , called Pixelsnap Ring Stand (). This isn’t a revolutionary product by any stretch of the imagination, but I do feel like Google’s headed in the right direction with this one.

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority Chrome is a great browser, but it’s far from the best one out there. I tested more or less every major alternative to Google’s popular browser and found a better option for my personal wants and needs. Samsung Internet has more features, offers superior customizability, and comes with a few extra security options. Despite what many think, it can be downloaded to just about any Android phone , so it’s not exclusive to Samsung devices. Most people just default to Chrome, as it’s the most well-known and readily available browser on all smartphones. But I urge everyone to at least try out Samsung Internet to see that Chrome has fierce competition.",

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s in-house Tensor chips are facing heavy criticism from fans for their subpar performance and poor battery life. Readers feel that Google Pixels, which are priced as flagships, largely lack the performance to justify the price tag. While some fans appreciate the AI features and software integration of the chip, many believe that its flaws outweigh its benefits. The recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 looks promising on paper, and Qualcomm seems poised for another successful year, securing its place among top Android flagships once again. Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C. Scott Brown is actually glad that Pixels don’t use Snapdragon . Much like he predicted, this opinion was highly controversial, and it seems a lot of our readers are done forgiving Tensor for its mediocrity. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance. Still, it appears LTE’s days are numbered, at least for those on the T-Mobile network. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
