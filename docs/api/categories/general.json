Set in a world where alchemists battle to drain goblins of their magical blood, it feels one part '80s fantasy, one part doodles out of the back of a troubled teenager's schoolbook, and one part something you'd see airbrushed onto the side of a van. I love it. I'd be sold on looks alone, but having gotten to play a section of Flask at Gamescom last month, I'm convinced there's a really solid roguelike here too. As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage. When you fight a goblin, each of you will run through all your flasks in order, and then if you're still alive, the process will continue to loop until goopy gre…",

Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one. The obvious question to ask here is 'why?' and that's an easy one to answer. Naya Create specs (Image cr…",

And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what's particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business. In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021.

As the patch notes linked above read, there'll be a \"Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter\", the former of which has been giving players considerable trouble . There'll also be a \"Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers\", which are the worms in the Blasted Steps—likely taking their damage from two masks to one. The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines.

Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting .

The route you'll need to take looks a little like this: (Image credit: Team Cherry) Make sure you've got 60 rosaries before starting, ideally secured in the form of a consumable string or a necklace. Start at the halfway home bench, take the elevator, then hop across the rickety platforms to get into Sinner's Road proper.
