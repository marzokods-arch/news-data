The phone brings back beloved features like a 3.5mm headphone jack, front-facing speakers, and a microSD card slot. It comes with Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, a 5,000mAh battery, and a promise of four OS updates and six years of security updates. After a rather disastrous start with the Xperia 1 VII , which involved dying products, paused sales, and a relaunch , Sony is back in the game with a new smartphone. The company has now launched the Xperia 10 VII, a compact mid-ranger that promises to pack a punch without burning a hole in your pocket. Sony Xperia 10 VII specifications and features",

Instead of using colors from your phone’s wallpaper, Android Auto’s media player could use the album art as the background once again. However, while testing this reversal, Google appears to have messed up another visual aspect in Android Auto. Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance . However, Google now appears to be testing a return to the older design. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front.

Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones.

However, anyone following Nova’s progress over the years (and the lack of it, more recently) would have seen the writing on the wall . We asked Nova Launcher fans what they will do now that the launcher has officially shut down, and unsurprisingly, it doesn’t seem any of us are ready to move on. Our poll received over 9,650 votes, making it one of the most popular polls in recent memory. More than 4,300 people say they will stick with Nova until it stops working, marking it the most popular way forward with ~45% of total votes.",

That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles.

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android.

If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

Apple claims the iPhone Air is just 5.6mm thin. However, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge and most other phones, this measurement doesn’t include the camera bump.

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

Things are changing this year for the better, as Apple is making some big upgrades with the iPhone 17 series, but as expected, it’s more of Apple catching up to Android than the iPhone packing in bleeding-edge tech.

    "summary": "Android could take another step towards iOS-fication with its new horizontal volume slider layout",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new horizontal layout for Android’s volume slider that will likely appear when the device is in landscape mode. This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A leak claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s camera bump measures 4.5mm, a little over 2mm more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s said that Samsung is sticking with a 1/2.52″ telephoto sensor at 50MP. The leak also claims that the phone weighs 217g. Recent Galaxy S26 leaks have hinted at Samsung bringing back the camera bump next year. And it’s not just the Galaxy S26 Edge that’s expected to have a bump; it appears this will be the case for the entire series. So if these phones are going to have a camera bump, just how large is that protrusion going to be? A new leak may give us an answer for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Well-known tipster Ice Universe has shared some new information about the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This leak touches on the thickness of the camera bump, as well as the size of the telephoto sensor and the phone’s weight.",

Nintendo Switch emulation had a rough one in 2024, but this year is shaping up to offer some huge leaps forward.
