Lots of RPGs, mind , just not massively multiplayer ones. What gives? Well, I've got a few theories, and I'd like to dig into them, but before I do: I think the MMO genre is actually in a pretty good place, right now. It's aging, certainly (we'll get into that later) but you certainly aren't spoiled for good offerings. World of Warcraft's got its juice back , and it's adding player housing soon. Final Fantasy 14 looks like it's on a course-correction . Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls: Online are great exploratory romps. Even those outside the big leagues are merrily trucking along. Hell, you can even play City of Heroes again! Arguably in its best-ever state! What, I say again, gives? Theory 1: Well, Harvey, none of us have any goddamn free time Here's the thing.

Nevertheless, it's a topic that's plagued Battlefield 6 since the very beginning, though its slate of strong military skins at launch was refreshing, to say the least. But with the launch in the rearview mirror now, all eyes are on Battlefield 6 Season 1 to see whether or not that grounded, military feeling is completely thrown to the wayside. After a handful of hours playing Season 1's content early, I can report that the first batch of post-launch cosmetics largely continues to deliver more grounded styles, but those of you who draw the distinction between tactical military gear and more stylised, 'cool' soldier apparel more strictly might see where this could potentially end up.

This is just the beginning, though, as Battlefield 6 Season 1 builds on this solid foundation with new maps, modes, vehicles, guns, attachments, and cosmetic items. This is the start of Battlefield 6's live-service support, so it'll be interesting to see both how the game develops going forward, but also how it competes with Call of Duty , especially with Black Ops 7 right around the corner. Below, I'll go over everything you need to know about BF6 Season 1. Battlefield 6 Season 1 release date (Image credit: EA) Battlefield 6 Season 1 launches on Tuesday, October 28, 2025 .

I just can't stay mad. It's worth noting the original PvZ is still perfectly playable on PC. It looks a bit dated, yeah, very pixelated on modern big screens, but it's still fine!

But this is the really exciting bit. Not only will this factory focus on OLED panels for monitors, laptops and tablets, at least at first, but it also uses a novel inkjet manufacturing process to reduce costs. Currently, virtually all PC monitors with OLED screens are based on panels from just two suppliers—LG and Samsung. This duopoly is obviously never going to be a good thing for pricing and competition. So, the insertion of TCL into the fray is most welcome. According to flatpanelshd , TCL will invest over $4 billion into to the new facility, known as T8 and located in Guangzhou, China. The factory will use a so-called 8.6-generation production process, creating huge 2.29 by 2.62 metre OLED substrates, which can then be sliced into smaller screens. TCL currently produces OLED panels on the 5.5G process, mainly for smaller displays that go into laptops, tablets and phones. Aside from the size of the substrate being produced, TCL's new factory is also interesting by virtue of using an inkjet process to \"print\" the panels . LG an…",

Cooler Master's suggested fix was to adjust the angle of the cable by using \"a small pick or flat screwdriver to release the clips from both sides of the cap.\" If your initial reaction to this suggestion isn't to pull a cartoonish O-face, then maybe you've forgotten about the fact that these 12V-2x6 cables seem to be prone to melting , at least with higher-end graphics cards.

It's called Saints Quarter, and I wouldn't blame you for forgetting (or only now realizing) it exists. Until yesterday, I'd only played on it by accident. Saints Quarter is an anomaly in Battlefield 6's map pool, because it's the only map that's exclusively infantry-only. The most popular modes like Conquest, Rush, and Breakthrough are incompatible with Saints Quarter, so you'll only encounter it in 8v8 playlists like Team Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. (If you also forgot Battlefield 6 had those modes, you're forgiven twice.) I don't fire up Battlefield 6 looking for cramped city streets and small teams—it's all about the big maps, baby—but I have to give Saints Quarter credit. It's not my favorite Battlefield 6 map, but it might be its most successful. In essence, Saints Quarters represents Battlefield Studios' best stab at the Call of Duty experience.

There are seriously a lot of these: in the second half of 2025 alone we've had Heartbeat in Thailand, Such a Guy, Road to Empress, and Love Begins With Goodbye. Most are centred around romance and themed similarly to visual novels: you're a guy, there are a handful of women to talk to, and your choices determine which woman you'll end up hooking up with. Sometimes it's as simple as that: sometimes there's a bit of heart-pumping action involved. At Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week I saw a game called Island of Hearts, which releases early next year and is ostensibly a \"big deal\" as far as these FMV dating sims games go.

Today, that's begun to change thanks to This Is No Cave. It's a minimalist sci-fi platformer, where you play as a charming little yellow-suited astronaut attempting to escape their crash landing on an alien planet by using their boot thrusters and grappling hook to fling their tumbling body through a labyrinth of subterranean tunnels. (Those tunnels, I'm told, are not a cave.) The secret to making 2D movement manageable for me, it turns out, is to take the buttons out of my hands. In This Is No Cave, movement is controlled with mouseclicks: Left click jumps and fires suit thrusters to launch yourself towards my cursor, while right click latches onto grapple points with my grappling hook. That's it. The simplicity of controls, however, doesn't detract from the complexity of the platforming…",

I spent ages searching for the option too, but there is no manual save in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. The system is a tad barebones and what you see from the beginning is what you get. Unless you're willing to repeat quests completely, the vampire RPG makes you dig Phyre's grave, then lie in it. How do you save in Bloodliness 2? The only way to save in Bloodlines 2 is its auto-save system which keeps your progress through vampire-infested Seattle. When an auto-save is in progress, you'll see an icon in the top right corner of the screen that looks like the Anarch Tags spraypainted around the city.

At first glance, it would seem that you get four Type-C and 11 Type-A sockets for USB devices, but that's only half the story. Like many mainstream and high-end Core Ultra 200S motherboards, the MEG Z890 Ace sports two Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Redditor The87Player has built something truly unique, a gaming PC with aged components crammed inside what looks to be a large plastic water jug, with six RGB-emblazoned fans socketed into the front. With one solitary exhaust fan at the rear and no visible ventilation anywhere else, I'd like to note. Luckily, the hardware inside isn't likely to cause too much financial distress if it melts itself into oblivion, as the whole setup is said to have cost €130. That's around $150, for those of you that only speak in God's own currency. Anyway, it's got a decade-old Intel Xeon E5-2673 v3 CPU at its heart, in combination with a luxurious 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (that feels weird to type at this point) and a GTX 960 trucking away in the GPU slot. So, what sort of performance can we expect from this juggernaut (sorry) of PC gaming greatness? A whole 15 fps in Fortnite at High setting…",

Well, Caleb Denison of CalebRated is here to tell you that's not gonna happen. And I'm here to tell you Caleb is right. According to Caleb in a video posted today , the story increasingly goes that OLED is running out of time and will soon be replaced by RGB mini-LED technology. In part that's thanks to developments like Sony's decision to drop its top rung OLED TV in favour of RGB mini-LED tech and also Samsung's similar micro RGB TV tech . This narrative is likewise driven by the idea that OLED is difficult and expensive to make, which it is, and that consumers are increasingly preferring larger and larger TVs, which they are. That cost problem for OLED is only amplified as panel sizes increase. 85-inch plus OLEDs are crazy money.
