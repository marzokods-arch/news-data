    "body": "Wicked: For Good has grossed $518.4 million worldwide in its first six weeks at the boxoffice, which puts it at No. 3 on Billboard ’s list of the top-grossing films that are adapted from Broadway musicals. Our list is drawn from boxofficemojo.com’s running tally of the 1,000 top-grossing films of all time in terms of worldwide grosses. Both Wicked: for Good and its predecessor, 2024’s Wicked , were adapted from the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked . The first Wicked film opened on Nov. 22, 2024. In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Nominations for the 2026 Oscars will be announced on Thursday Jan. 22. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M. Chu, whose hit-studded résumé includes a previous film adaptation of a Broadway musical, the 2021 movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s breakout hit In the Heights . Eight film adaptations of Broadway musicals appear on Box…",

    "body": "Morgan Wallen ’s I&#8217;m the Problem leads Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart (dated Jan. 10) for the 33rd consecutive week. This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 219, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black art…",

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 34-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week.
