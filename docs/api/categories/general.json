Yes, the Pixel 10 series does have a familiar feature or two from some of its closest Android rivals, but they’re hardly cheap clones.

At I/O 2024, Google announced a handy feature called Everything Else for Google Wallet . With this feature, you can scan or capture a picture of virtually any physical ID or pass and convert it into a digital item for storing in the Wallet app. Everything Else started rolling out in the US in August last year and is now being made available to markets beyond the US. Google has recently updated a support page , with changes indicating that “Everything Else” on Google Wallet is starting to roll out to other regions. More specifically, the instructions on the page for adding an image to Google Wallet have been tweaked. The headline for the section now reads “Add items from a photo (except Australia, India, &amp; Japan),” where the names of the excluded regions have been added. This hints at availability outside the US, though the reason behind the exclusion of Australia, India, and…",

Reddit user RagSaucy has spotted that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL support 12-bit 4K RAW video capture — a first for the series. In theory, a higher bit-depth allows the phone to capture a wider dynamic range, resulting in additional shadow or highlight detail with less risk of over- or underexposure. Previous Pixel flagships are capped at 10-bit video capture, and that’s still the case if you shoot via the Pixel Camera app on the 10 series.

This feature is available for Workspace users and those who are subscribed to Gemini AI Pro or Ultra plans, but you can only access it through Docs on the web.
