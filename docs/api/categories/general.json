    "body": "Alicia Keys had a busy Friday (Nov. 21). Not only did the 17-time Grammy winner release a new holiday song and guest on a single from an Italian vocal legend, but she made a special appearance alongside the cast of her semi-autobiographical Broadway musical, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, at the Shubert Theatre. Keys was in the house to deliver a mini-set as part of an &#8220;encore sessions&#8221; performance, but she was also there salute to the Broadway debut of Grammy-winning gospel singer Yolanda Adams, who just joined the cast as Miss Liza Jane. After belting the &#8220;Empire State of Mind&#8221; finale with the cast, Keys and Adams took the stage together. &#8220;First of all, I’m grateful,&#8221; said Adams, hugging Keys. &#8220;All that dancing made me feel younger, but my feet say no. I have to thank Alicia for saying, &#8216;Hey, what do you think about&#8230;?&#8217; And I’d already thought about it, and I tried it, and I love it.&#8221; When Adams left the stage, Keys was in her element, blissfully relaxed at an upright piano while crooning her cover of Prince&#8217;s &#8220;How Come U Don&#8217;t Call Me Anymore?&#8221;, duetting with cast member Durrell &#8220;Tank&#8221; B…",

Vanoni died of cardiac arrest at her Milan home, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported. Vanoni recorded more than 100 albums with sales of over 55 million copies, vaulting her to iconic status among generations of fans and earning her the moniker “The Lady of Italian Song,” according to LaPresse newspaper. Born in Milan in 1937, Vanoni’s first love was the theater, which culminated with performances on the Broadway stage in 1964. But her passion for music combined with what LaPresse described as a “highly personal and…",

The highly-awaited tour is Bunny&#8217;s official world trek, which will take him through Latin America, Europe and Asia after his historic 31-show residency in Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny’s connection with the Dominican Republic is close. In 2022, he dedicated a Latin Grammy to the country after winning best urban fusion/performance for &#8220;Tití Me Preguntó.&#8221; That same year, he sold out two consecutive nights at the Olympic Stadium &#8212; and before that, he&#8217;d built a strong bond with the Dominican audience through collaborations like “La Romana” with El Alfa. He even gives them a shoutout in “El Apagón,” saying, “Si no me voy pa’ RD… un saludo a mis vecinos, ey (de lo’ mío’, ¿qué lo qué?)” &#8211;which roughly translates to, &#8220;If I don’t go to DR… a shoutout to my neighbors, hey (my people, what’s up?).&#8221; So it was no coincidence that for these particular two shows, the preferred seating area in the stadium was named Los Vecinos (&#8220;The Neighbors&#8221;) in honor of…",

The twin one-day events mark Rolling Loud’s first shows in Australia since 2019, and the first time the global hip-hop festival brand has expanded to a two-city format in the country. Gunna will headline the two-city run, following Rolling Loud’s earlier confirmation that the rapper would anchor the event. Ken Carson joins him at top billing, extending the Opium-affiliated artist’s growing presence across the festival’s global footprint. Sexyy Red — previously announced — leads the second tier of performers. The 2026 bill includes several major U.S. rap acts across its main stages. Sexyy Red, Tyga, Swae Lee, Lil Tjay, Ski Mask the Slump God, NLE Choppa, Quavo, Ian and rising rapper Osamason are among the international performers scheduled across the weekend.

With Olivia Dean , Yungblud , Lola Young and RAYE all conquering the Billboard charts in the U.S., and Oasis putting on the biggest tour of the year, the return of the art-rock fivepiece after an seven-year absence feels low-key in comparison. There is no new music to plug, simply a run of shows in major European cities, and an unpredictable setlist – this is as understated as an arena-headlining band could ever dream to be. That said, 2025 has still been notable for the group. Earlier this year they reassessed their 2003 album Hail to The Thief and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company for a new production of Hamlet . Elsewhere “Let Down,” an album track from their 1997 opus OK Computer went viral and landed on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time. Their Spotify monthly listener count now tops 44m users, higher than other British rockers such as Oasis, The Rolling Stones and even The Beatles. All this comes despite a period of relative inactivity. The band’s last LP A Moon Shaped Pool was released in 2016 and the group completed touring for it in 2018. Yorke told T…",
