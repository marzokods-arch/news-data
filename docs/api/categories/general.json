There are actually two types of yokai—Nurikabe and Mujina—that you can ward off using emotes. So here's what you need to do. How to emote in Nioh 3 (Image credit: Team Ninja) You can emote in Nioh 3 by pressing the right bumper and the start button on controller, or 'G' on keyboard. This will open the gesture window where you can pick from a bunch of different gestures (there are multiple pages, so no doubt an emote for every mood). Select your emote, and your character will bust a move. If you're wondering why the emotes are colour-coded, that'll come in handy for dealing with Nurikabe yokai.

Balatro (Image credit: LocalThunk) Entering a new year, everyone has their list of most hotly anticipated games (here's ours ), but Balatro is the perfect example of a Cinderella story that comes out of nowhere. A single developer tinkering around, trying to learn how to build a game, resulted in a smash hit that won Best Indie Game and was nominated for Ultimate Game of the Year in 2024's Golden Joystick Awards . This roguelike deckbuilder tasks you with racking up absurdly high point totals by whatever means necessary, whether that's filling your hand with multiples of the same card or using special math powers conferred on you by your collection of Jokers.

From an RTS that ushered in Blizzard as a game industry powerhouse to one of the world's most dominant and enduring MMOs, with various sequels, spinoffs, and multimedia crossovers along the way, Warcraft has grown over the past 30-plus years into one of the biggest, most reliable, and most recognizable names in the business. It is, by every measure (well, except that movie ) an unmitigated success. And apparently, Chris Metzen, the executive creative director of the Warcraft universe, sometimes wishes it had a different name. This interesting spot of trivia came out of a recent Game Business interview with World of Warcraft vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale and game director Ion Hazzikostas (via GamesRadar ), in which Longdale expressed a desire to do more with Warcraft, beginning with broadening its appeal. \"It’s a fantastic IP,\" Longdale sale. \"In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible. And that means evolving what Warcraft means, what it is, and where it’s going. \"We want it to be approachable. Chris Metzen is sometimes like, ‘I w…",

As reported by Game Developer , QA workers at Blizzard's Albany and Austin studios have ratified a union contract after almost three years of negotiating. That sounds like an awfully long time to me, but it seems to be the going rate for union contracts with Microsoft— Raven's QA workers also took three years to get theirs sorted. Fortunately, it all paid off in the end, because now 60+ workers are covered by the new agreement and it offers them a number of significant benefits. A statement provided by the Communications Workers of America—the union that represents the workers—confirms that the QA staff will have guaranteed wage increases; more regulations on AI and generative AI usage at work to ensure workers are supported, not replaced; protections on fair crediting; disability accommodations; immigrant worker protection; and restrictions on \"mandatory 'crunch time' or excessive overtime hours.\" All in all, this is…",

The Keychron K2 HE Concrete Edition looks very much like a regular, off-white coloured keeb, but the company sure has gone to town with its heavyweight base. It's also gone to town with the marketing copy, some of which I shall reproduce below: \"Smooth marble-like concrete shell seamlessly merges with cement gray keycaps,\" says Keychron. \"Each keystroke carries industrial rhythm, preserving the concrete's solid core while elevating the experience with marble-like smoothness and auditory-visual harmony.\" I'm not sure about all that, but I do like the idea of \"industrial rhythm\". Until today, I was fairly convinced it was a musical genre I wasn't entirely into—but hey, we all live and learn. The 75%-sized keeb features double-shot PBT keycaps, hot-swappable switches, 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth connections, and of course, a hefty concrete chassis.

The reasons why are complicated, but famous hedge fund manager Michael Burry has some ideas. You know, the guy portrayed by Christian Bale in 2015's The Big Short . Burry took to his paid subscriber Substack page to declare that crypto was experiencing a \"collateral death spiral\", thanks to \"sky high leverage\" on crypto exchanges due to rising metal prices, which in turn meant that \"as the crypto collateral fell, the tokenized metals had to be sold\" (via Coindesk ). To understand what's happening here, I need to explain tokenised metals , so strap in. According to information I learned this morning (I have so little interest in crypto it's physically painful), tokenised metals are essentially blockchain representations of assets like gold, platinum and silver.

Roman Hartung who fronts the der8auer channel is also CEO of PC cooling specialist Thermal Grizzly. In that capacity, he's directly involved in buying 12 mm thick copper plates which are used via CNC manufacturing to produce items such as water cooling blocks for graphics cards. Hartung says he attempted to make a routine order for the plates back in October. Normally, the copper plates are shipped out within a few weeks of placing an order. But this time, he was told a price couldn't be confirmed and delivery would not be possible until February. Another supplier said they could deliver plates, but at a 40% higher price than before. Thermal Grizzly was paying around 190 euros per plate last year, with each plate enough to make four RTX 5080 GPU water cooling blocks. Today, he says the company would have to pay 280 euros per plate, potentially making the cooling block product non-viable. Hartung points out that in terms of market commodity pricing, copper has increased from $9,000 per tonne a year ago to an all-time…",
