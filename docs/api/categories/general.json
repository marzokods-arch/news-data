I'll admit, I completely forgot this was a thing once the game had launched, and it's no wonder why, because these songs weren't actually in the game yet, just the credits and trailers. Well, if you've been jonesing for some legendary tracks, the time has come. With the launch of Season 1 , you can now find radios installed in vehicles in both core Battlefield 6 and the Redsec battle royale—just hold 'Q' to open the command wheel and select a station at the top. That's all well and good; you can listen to beats on the move, and there's nothing quite like dodging mines and rocket barrages while peacefully jamming out. However, what I was not expecting was a paywalled radio station. Those who own the Battlefield Pro version of the battle pass, which costs $24.99/£21.99, have access to an exclusive radio station creatively named Battlepass Radio.

Amirite? OK, maybe videogame patents aren't at the forefront of our minds, but they do come up as a topic from time to time, especially due to some of the more, ahem, litigious game companies out there. And even when they're not in the news, it can be kind of fun to look through patents for various gaming tech and game systems, especially when it comes to the diagrams included in the patents. In that spirit, I've got a new quiz for you! I'll show you a diagram from a videogame patent, and you do your best to answer a multiple choice question about it.

Dehumanizing people by equating them to a parasitic alien life form is overtly grotesque, yes, but the message also invoked a more mundane question: Did DHS have Microsoft's permission to use the image in its message?

Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright . And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end : Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours ) but active development is over.

So they did! \"The two of them came in with their visual effects guy, and effectively they said to Kojima, 'We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?'

As you'd expect from a battle royale, the types of skirmishes you'll get into in Battlefield Redsec are more varied, so you'll need guns to compete in a variety of different situations. SMGs and shotguns may be lethal up close, but you're going to want something with a bit more damage at range to pick up the slack when you're in a long-distance relationship with your enemy.

It's a seriously impressive-looking device on paper, with what initially appears to be a relatively slim 8-inch form factor, given the massive Ryzen AI Max 395 APU tucked inside (via Videocardz ). However, as our Jacob found when he reviewed the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the also-chonky Ryzen AI Max 390 chip at its core, it's not easy to make a portable device with one of AMD's mega-APUs without making some compromises. In the case of the ROG Flow Z13, one of those compromises was a massive power brick. In the OneXFly Apex, that appears to have translated to a swappable 85 Wh external battery pack, which is very reminiscent of the GPD Win 5 , another Strix Halo-powered handheld with an extra juice box. To be fair, the OneXFly Apex's solution looks a whole lot neater, as it clicks into the back of the chassis in a way that means you might not notice it at first glance—although I'd be willing to bet you'd likely notice the weight.

    "body": "Solving Otto's lock puzzle in Free Market Station is one of the first real brain ticklers you'll find in The Outer Worlds 2 . After playing around with the switches and reading the note beside them, you'll likely conclude that it's basically impossible—you're lacking in vital information as to what the switches actually do. All you know is that there's mysterious unclaimed loot behind the door you want to pilfer. The reason the Free Market Station lock puzzle is seemingly impossible is because that's actually kind of true. You need a special gadget in order to be able to interact with the puzzle properly at all: the N-Ray. Below, I've included info about where to find said N-Ray, but also I've added a video of me solving the puzzle without it—if you follow my switch-flipping order, it should open the door for you either way. Free Market Station lock puzzle solution in The Outer Worlds 2 Now, the proper way you're supposed to solve this puzzle is to acquire the N-Ray gadget at the N-Ray Range in northwest Golden Ridge. You head here as part of the main story quest, but this device essentially lets you see wires through walls, which is necessary for solving this puzzle. The puzzle i…",

    "body": "Deciding whether to spare De Vries in The Outer Worlds 2 is the culmination of your journey through Arcadia so far, but despite what you might've expected, it's not the end of the game by a long shot. After chasing the rogue Earth Directorate agent, you finally corner her in Greater Tranquillity Substation, where she's about to perform her biggest gambit yet: assassinating peace representatives from Auntie's Choice and the Order. This leaves you with three choices: kill De Vries, spare De Vries, or spare De Vries and let her assassinate the representatives. Each option has its own set of consequences, so I've laid them out below, including the path you need to take dialogue-wise to get De Vries to stand down. Should you kill or spare De Vries in The Outer Worlds 2? You can spare De Vries with some skill checks if you discovered enough info about her (Image credit: Obsidian) The simplest way to resolve the situation is to kill De Vries and stop her from assassinating the peace representatives. The immediate outcome for doing this is surprisingly similar to sparing her; you can take her Simplifier rifle from the stand, the rift event still occurs so you have to escape the station, a…",

Each one contains a special unique weapon or piece of armor that usually has a pretty strong skill, though to actually open them you'll first have to find enough Advanced Decryption Keys . The rarity of said keys makes choosing which lockboxes to open a tough decision. Though, as you explore Arcadia's many moons and planets, you'll find more High Security Lockboxes with a wider variety of unique gear, so there's nothing wrong with holding onto your keys until you find something you actually want. Outer Worlds 2 High Security Lockbox locations I've found 11 High Security Lockboxes across the game's first few areas. Here's where you can find each, what it'll cost you to open in terms of keys, plus I've added map screenshots to the entries where the boxes are tricky to find.

Whilst pursuing Seer Wiley and his Order fanatics through the twisting corridors of Alexandra Monastery, you'll come face-to-face with an elaborate and sadistic quandary the seer has prepared for you. On the one hand, you can save the hostages by completing an elaborate puzzle, but it'll give Wiley more time to accomplish his objectives. On the other hand, you can leave the hostages to their fate—getting squished by a pneumatic press—but you'll reach Wiley faster and might be able to throw a spanner in his schemes. I explain both outcomes below and what the consequences are, but I also run through how to complete the hostage puzzle, including a little video of me doing it in-game.

The main result of saving the hostages is that you'll have to face extra Automech enemies when infiltrating Greater Tranquility Station (Image credit: Obsidian) Saving or leaving the hostages in The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't impact as much as you'd think, but it does change a few things.
