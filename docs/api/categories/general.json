There is one fix specifically for new Pixel 10 handsets, addressing “frozen or fuzzy” screen output. We may be firmly into the second week of October by now, but with the month getting started mid-week like it did, that’s meant having to wait a few days to get our hands on Google’s latest updates for its Pixel hardware. Yesterday, Verizon offered us a taste of what to expect, previewing the changes in the October 2025 Pixel update , and now we’re finally seeing Google make those updates available.

At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead. For Android users seeking raw, benchmark-beating performance, this hypothetical Android-based iPhone 17 Pro w…",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

We’ve already looked at the role smartphones have been playing in this saga, with moves by Google and Apple alike that appear to support the government’s efforts and remove access to apps designed to protect people from ICE harassment .

The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.
