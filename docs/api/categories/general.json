Taylor Swift &#8216;s The Life of a Showgirl made history this week by officially moving 4.002 million units in its debut week of release, with 3,479,500 of those coming in sales — both single-week records for an album released in the modern era (since 1991). Showgirl passes Adele&#8217;s 25 , which previously held both benchmarks — moving 3.482 million units in its 2015 debut week, with 3.378 million of that number coming in sales. In addition setting those records while debuting atop the Billboard 200 , Showgirl launches all 12 of its tracks into the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100 — also a record for top-end dominance — as lead single and opening track &#8220;The Fate of Ophelia&#8221; bows at No. 1, becoming Swift&#8217;s 13th song to reign on the chart.

The record kicks off with “from me to u (feat. Poppy),” composed by former Bring Me The Horizon member Jordan Fish, setting the tone for a collection of ten collaborations with artists the band has encountered throughout their global journey. The title, METAL FORTH , reflects the idea of going “beyond metal,” and as SU-METAL explains, it’s “an album packed with BABYMETAL seen from many different angles.” More than just a bold new chapter for the band’s reborn lineup, the release also comes at a milestone moment: BABYMETAL’s 15th anniversary. METAL FORTH marks a brilliant update to the group&#8217;s career, and the three members — SU-METAL, MOAMETAL, and MOMOMETAL — chatted about what it means to them.

While not the cheapest overall, Tello’s plan includes free calling to 60+ countries, adding strong value for international callers. Tello is easily one of the very best prepaid options out there for those on a tight budget who don’t need truly unlimited data, but it’s typically not ideal for heavier users unless you keep most of your data consumption to Wi-Fi. Up until now, Tello’s $25 Unlimited plan has been capped at just 35GB of high-speed data, after which it essentially goes down to nearly unusable speeds that aren’t much better than dial-up.

See, I’ve just always loved the way Google can pull details and colors out of my stills, not to mention the fact that Magic Editor is, well, magic. The problem, though, is that Google has always been just okay when it comes to videos (sorry, Jonas Brothers ). Apple, for its part, has always struggled with the opposite problem — it’s long been the king of video, only to leave me underwhelmed by its photos. Now, though, Apple seems determined to put its stills on par with the best Android camera phones , and I wanted to see if that was really possible.

Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

Home Brief is one of the new Gemini-powered features that arrived with that update. It’s designed to give users a quick overview of their day by automatically identifying key household events and summarizing hours of footage into a short, easy-to-digest recap.

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR A new leak reveals a powerful potential camera setup for the Xiaomi 17 Ultra. The specs suggest that the upcoming flagship may feature a quad-sensor camera array, although this isn’t yet clear. The leaker hints at two versions of the device that share hardware but differ in “revolutionary” imaging features. Xiaomi’s flagships rarely disappoint when it comes to cameras, with the 15 Ultra being our top pick for premium camera phones . The next device in the series doesn’t look like it’ll break this pattern. A reliable leaker has shared new details that point to big imaging upgrades for the upcoming Xiaomi 17 Ultra, and possibly two versions of the device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Chrome will start automatically revoking notification permission for sites you don’t regularly interact with. This move follows similar steps for revoking camera and location permissions. Users can always re-allow notifications, or turn the feature off entirely. Notifications are such a double-edged sword. While tactfully deployed notifications are wonderful, keeping us informed about the things we care about most, it is far too easy to get carried away there, and once we ruin that signal-to-noise ratio with too many unwanted notifications , they all start becoming a lot less useful. Thankfully, developers are aware of the risks here, and have been working to develop systems designed to help us regain control and keep our notifications as beneficial as possible.

    "summary": "The secret to Google's best wearable yet? Screws instead of glue.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google heavily promoted the Pixel Watch 4’s reparability, and a teardown confirms big improvements. Instead of glue, the hardware is held together with screws and gaskets, for easy service. Everything from the battery to the display is replaceable. Of all Google’s new hardware this season, could the breakout star be a lowly smartwatch? We maybe weren’t expecting a lot from the Pixel Watch 4 early on, when it sounded like it might be just a minor refresh of past generations. But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables. But did the company actually make real progress there, or have those claims been a little oversold? According to the latest iFixit teardown, the Pixel Watch 4 very much delivers when it comes to being able to service its hardware.",
