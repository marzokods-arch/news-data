As shared here by Businesswire (thanks, Automaton ), 3D Investment states that Square Enix has, in the three years since replacing its president , been \"facing the following management issues: (i) a sluggish revenue growth rate and (ii) sluggish profit margins … More recently, SQEX HD recorded massive impairment losses on game development assets, which lack earning power, so SQEX HD is in a very serious situation.\" This is exasperated by the fact, the shareholder argues that Square's \"medium-te…",

The Philips Evnia 27M2N5500XD and AOC AGON Pro AGP277QK are both 500 Hz 1440p gaming panels with 1,000 Hz alternative 1080p modes. Size-wise, we're talking 27 inches. The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

Netherite horse armor takes a significant amount of work, but it's well worth it. If you're bringing the same horse out each time you adventure, you'll want to keep it safe, and given the fact netherite is the strongest material in the game, it'll more than do the trick. Unlike all other armor, netherite has no durability either, so you know that once you've made it, you probably won't have to again, which is a huge plus for the material. You can also equip it on any adult horse, including zombie horses, which come with their own added perk. So, if you're convinced to give the craft a go, here's how you can make it. How to craft netherite horse armour in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) If you want to get ahold of netherite horse armor in Minecraft, you'll need a set of diamond horse armor first .

Working out how to craft a spear is incredibly easy, depending on which material you want to use for it, but it can be a little tricky to master its moveset.

Here's everything you need to know about how to create one and how you can make the most of its moves. How to craft a spear in Minecraft (Image credit: Mojang) To craft a spear in Minecraft, you need two sticks and your chosen material. Place one stick in the bottom left corner, one in the middle row and center square, plus your material in the top right corner. It's essential that these materials are placed diagonally, since if you place them vertically, you'll end up with a shovel which won't do much damage to your enemies.

    "body": "Minecraft 's Mounts of Mayhem drop introduced the Nautilus to the game; an underwater mount that whips you around under the waves much faster than swimming. If you've been waiting for an excuse to finally explore underwater, then finding a Nautilus might be your key to success. But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking.

No going around introducing myself to every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the island.

Its MMX 330 Pro cans are supremely comfortable, the open-back design with STELLAR.45 drivers makes games, music, and everything in between sound phenomenal. But it's not perfect. Aside from the obvious lack of microphone for game chat, it's also not the most portable headset for gaming on the go. So in an attempt to remedy this, Beyer has introduced a lighter, closed back headphone with an easily detachable cable that can work both 3.5mm and USB-C. The new, smaller, Beyerdynamic DT 270 Pro can't beat my beloved DT 900 Pro X in sheer performance and comfort but it can certainly pack down into my backpack a helluva lot easier while still giving me that sweet, sweet Beyerdynamic sound. The design language is pure Beyerdynamic minimalism. Matte black cups, spring-steel headband, understated padding—no RGB strips, no gamer logos, nothing you'd be embarrassed to wear out and about. Though, while I wouldn't say it feels cheap, it certainly lacks the panache of its more expensive siblings.

But did you know exactly how much spoken dialogue, down to the very second? Well, one fan, who seems to've done the legwork, is able to answer that question: 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds. User Everwhite-moonlight on the Baldur's Gate 3 subreddit has compiled a spreadsheet that tallies not only the hours spoken by each character (and their respective voice actor), but also the amount of files they speak in. For example, Amelia Tyler, who voices the game's silk-toned narrator, is understandable top billing at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds of chatting—over a brain-boggling 7,629 files. Hilariously, Astarion takes the prize for biggest yapper in all of Baldur's Gate, just one hour shy of beating out the main character's literal inner monologue: 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. Larian's work is even more impressive when Everwhite-moonlight tallies it up, though: \"There are about 173,642 voice files in the game with the combine…",
