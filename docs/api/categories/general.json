You can't access this wish until you've acquired the Silk Soar ability in Act 3 , specifically via The Dark Below quest. Once that's done, head to the right side of the Pale Lake in the Putrified Ducts (just across from Fleatopia), climb up the platforms, and use Silk Soar to enter the passage above where you'll find the riddle in question and be able to get started.

Despite writing an article about the reaction to Nvidia's brutal optimised settings charts for Borderlands 4, and being well aware of stuttering issues thanks to Nick's performance testing piece, I jumped into the game this weekend anyway. And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Plus, if you've made it to any of the main bosses or final encounters in any of the vaults, you'll know just how much you'll have to use these in combat, especially the grapple. The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it? Head into the accessibility settings and disable ' grapple view tilt '.

A glass bottle containing a single glowing strand of hair suspended in blue liquid. An iron claw clutching black gemstone covered in blood-red streaks. Grotesque wooden figurines, several items that appear to be severed hands, a silver pendant with a green eyeball in the center that rolls to follow my every movement. What are these things? Fans of Bad Viking's first shopkeeping puzzle adventure, Strange Horticulture, will feel right at home in the gloomy yet cozy occult shop solving the little mysteries surrounding each artifact, dozens and dozens of them, over the course of about 12 hours.

This will introduce a brand new character, and an entirely new realm to the game containing all sorts of critters, crafting materials, and quests. With significant updates like this, it's always best to set aside some time to make sure your island is ready and your pockets are stuffed with any items you might need while exploring a new land. Preparing for the release of Wheatflour Wonderland will also prevent any unnecessary obstacles getting in the way of your budding friendship with Cogimyun, the game's newest character. Since friendship progression is limited to how much you can craft per day, anyone looking to blast through the new set of friendship quests will want to give themselves a headstart. Here's what I'd advise you to do. How to prepare for the Hello Kitty Island Adventure DLC We haven't been warned of any preparation ahead of the DLC's launch, so I imagine there's nothing we need to do ahead of time. But, these are a few things I am going to do to give myself a headstart before befriending Cogimyun and exploring a brand new adventure. Make sure your friendships are high w…",

On the one hand, I dropped 800 or so quid on it and it carried on chugging for a decade. On the other hand, it really kept me on my toes throughout the back half of its lifespan. Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop .

For a game widely agreed to be extremely challenging, one that PCG contributor Tyler Colp called \"worth the pain\" in his 90% review of Silksong , I find this to be a staggering accomplishment for how quickly CrankyTemplar managed it.

    "body": "Netflix has released a \"first clip\" of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher Season Four, as distinct from the \"first look\" we got back in May . This is our first actual scene from the season and not a little teaser, though, with Hemsworth sporting the white locks and leather armor of everyone's favorite mutant monster slayer. The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom. Rounding out some fun deployment of Witcher signs, Geralt lures the thing into a Yrden trap so he can actually harm it⁠, and finishes it off by tearing out its heart a…",

I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot.

    "body": "As reported by Automaton , iconic video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, has recently given his take on the state of videogame music. In an interview with Japanese outlet Real Sound , Uematsu commented on where the industry is now, particularly concern about creative freedom for composers being stifled. \"I won’t go as far as to call it stagnation, but I believe directors and producers hold too much power in their hands even when it comes to the music,\" said Uematsu, according to Automaton's translation. \"Even now, game composers aren’t in a position to speak their opinion freely, and no matter how much musical knowledge or technical skills they possess, they’re still in a position where it’s difficult to speak their mind. \"There are almost no game producers who are well versed in worldwide entertainment and are familiar with a wide variety of musical genres, so anything goes for them as long as you make it sound like a John Williams movie soundtrack.\" Uematsu compared the situation to the game music industry back in the NES era of the 80s. Back then, few composers had their eye on making music for games, but that has changed dramati…",

    "body": "The screen adaptation of BioShock is still in the works at Netflix, but it sounds like we're going to have a long wait before its release date. The delay is due to director Francis Lawrence's busy schedule, according to an interview with The Direct . Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games. It began filming this summer and is set to release on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence directed all four of the previous Hunger Games films, so it's no surprise he returned for this one. Unfortunately for BioShock fans, that means Lawrence has his hands full for the time being. Filming for a movie like Sunrise on the Reaping can take …",

To that end, they used a corridor on the way to Nox in the Deepnest area of Hallownest, and part of the path to Pinmaster in the Blasted Steps of Pharloom. The Blasted Steps corridor had a 12.5% taller pixel count than the Deepnest one in-game, so Karmyuh scaled Pharloom's map up based on that difference.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",

Not that they're good, certainly—they usually aren't, with a handful of begrudging exceptions. Nor that they're particularly faithful to or even respectful of the series we love, most of the time. But we can definitely say that they exist. In other words, they are undeniably a part of this great tapestry we call gaming, and we can't just dismiss them. Hide in ignorance, and you're liable to be ambushed by a new Resident Evil movie at an inopportune time—most embarrassing.
