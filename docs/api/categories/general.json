The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control.

When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows. Scrolling screenshots are a relatively new addition to Android, introduced back in Android 12 . Since then, Google has barely touched the feature, but it’s finally preparing a small but welcome quality-of-life improvement. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A special slimmed-down wireless charging coil from partner Witz was essential for this ultra-thin design.

Foldables have always fought a war on two fronts: You want a massive screen, but you don’t want a brick in your pocket. With the new Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has managed to keep the phone slim, measuring only 12.9mm thick when folded and just 3.9mm when open.

While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network?

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new feature that lets users prevent Gemini 3 Pro from thinking. This will allow Gemini to fall back on the Flash model, resulting in quicker responses. Google is already testing the feature with a select set of users. With the release of the Gemini 3 generation of AI models , Google’s smart assistant has racked up brilliant deep-thinking capabilities. However, the lack of a smart automatic model selector actively switching between fast and deep-thinking models — as ChatGPT offers — can result in Gemini taking longer and consuming more tokens for straightforward queries that don’t truly require deep thinking. An upcoming update to Gemini, however, could fix that, allowing users to manually override thinking and dial back to a quicker response.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify currently relies on global system settings to control its in-app animations, but these settings affect all animations on the phone. New code found in the Spotify app suggests a specific “Reduce animations” toggle is coming to the app. This feature could help users with motion sensitivity or those who simply find the autoplaying visuals too distracting. Spotify gives users plenty of reasons to switch over to its service . Features like Spotify Wrapped set up the whole year-in-recap trend, while the service has also been leaning into AI to help curate your next playlist . These additions have come at a steady pace, but the app also needs a cleanup — or at least, an option to disable some of the distractions.

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.
