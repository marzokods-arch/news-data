Gemini is slowly but surely replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem. While we wait for a broader rollout, most Google Home users just want the basics to work again.

This is the second hike of $0.50 since last year, but you’ll be spared if your monthly plan already includes federal taxes and telco fees. If you’re a T-Mobile customer in the US , your bill just went up overnight. That’s because the carrier is adding an auxiliary charge, separate from your monthly payment plan. As of Wednesday, January 21, T-Mobile is increasing its “Regulatory Programs &amp; Telco Recovery Fee” to $4.99 per voice line and $2.10 per mobile data line. That’s a $0.50 increase compared to before this date, when the fee per voice line was $3.99. If you have multiple lines in your plan, the total should reflect on your bill starting this month. T-Mobile updated its bill breakdown support page (via Droid-Life ) to reflect the new prices.",

Its “milestone year” including a sold-out Beyond The Valley , which gathered a record 40,000 attendees; a sold-out RÜFÜS DU SOL national tour; the coast-to-coast Wildlands festival; and Dom Dolla ’s Dec. 20 performance at Sydney’s Allianz Stadium , the first-ever stadium show in Australia by a homegrown DJ. That’s after Untitled landed for the first time in the top 20 (at No. 12) on Billboard’s 2025 Mid-Year Top Promoters, with US$51.5 million gross, on 542,000 attendance across 87 shows during the six-month reporting period.

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

Today, another leak corroborates part of that story while contradicting another. Apple news account AppleTrack has posted on Twitter about a fresh leak that says the iPhone 18 Pro series will indeed have the Face ID illuminator and sensor positioned under display pixels.

If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify is working on a new feature called Page Match that will let you seamlessly jump between audiobooks and physical books. When you scan a page in a physical book with your phone’s camera, Spotify will take you to that exact spot in the audiobook. The feature works both ways and also allows transitioning from an audiobook to its physical copy. It looks like Spotify is prepping a genuinely clever feature that meets bibliophiles and audiobook fans in the middle. It’s something Amazon has already done with ebooks and audiobooks, but Spotify is taking it a step further by not leaving lovers of physical books behind.",

We’re big fans of the original TrimUI Brick , and now the company is teasing a follow-up to the pocket-friendly handheld. The new device is called the TrimUI Brick Pro, and the teasers posted online suggest it will stick to the same Game Boy-style, vertical formula while adding more modern controls. In an Instagram post from its official account, TrimUI describes the Brick Pro as “the ultimate evolution of the vertical handheld.” The company says it has kept the ultra-portable DNA intact, but added a larger 4-inch display and dual analog sticks, arranged below the D-pad and face buttons. TrimUI also says the new layout has been reworked with modern gaming in mind, while still leaning into retro nostalgia.",

Only around 100 black units are expected to ship first, with wider shipments starting later in the week. The update follows the Pocket 6’s recent redesign, which reintroduced the handheld with two control layouts. It hasn’t been smooth sailing for Retroid over the last couple of months. After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

Keeping up with AI developments can be like watching a race where all the participants are at very different places. Far off in the distance, we can see new ideas taking shape, but it’s often anyone’s guess how long it will be before they’re ready for prime time. Last year, one of the big steps Google shared was Project Astra , a “universal AI assistant” able to work with apps across your phone. After getting our first taste last summer, we’re taking a look at where some of those Astra ambitions may be headed next.
