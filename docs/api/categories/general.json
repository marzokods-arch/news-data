    "body": "New Music Latin &nbsp;is a compilation of the best new Latin songs and albums recommended by Billboard and&nbsp; Billboard Español&nbsp; editors. Check out this week’s picks below. Pablo Alborán,&nbsp; KM0&nbsp; (Warner Music Spain) Pablo Alborán&#8217;s personal and heartfelt seventh album,&nbsp; KM0 , is a set of 14 songs and four bonus tracks in which he explores a variety of rhythms and styles. Born from the pain and uncertainty of a loved one’s illness, as the artist recounted in a recent interview with&nbsp; Billboard , the album showcases a more mature and determined musician with renewed artistic freedom. Here, Alborán takes on the songwriting of all the songs and, for the first time, produces and arranges most of them, experimenting with rhythms like country/folk (“Vámonos de Aquí,” with Indiara Sfair), salsa music (“La Vida Que Nos Espera”) and merengue (“Si Te Quedas”). The album opens with “Clickbait,” a pop track that critiques the superficiality and fake news of social media, addressing the obsession with fame and &#8220;likes.&#8221; And continues with the emotional title track, “KM0,” in which he sings about facing a new start after going through a very difficult p…",

The album arrived Nov. 9, 1993, hence the holiday. The album boasts a raw and underground sound the world of hip-hop hadn&rsquo;t heard before at the time. Despite the album&rsquo;s grittiness, it peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard 200. Usually, fans of the hip-hop group will celebrate with special events and releases.

    "body": "When Bob Dylan arrived in New York City in January 1961, he was a 19-year-old from Minnesota armed with an acoustic guitar and a head full of Woody Guthrie songs. His early recordings from that period — many featured on the just-released The Bootleg Series Volume 18: Through the Open Window, 1956-1963 — reveal a young artist still finding his voice, often mimicking the melodies and vocal styles of his heroes. Within a few months, Dylan would go through a transformation. The young singer-songwriter became an interpreter of others’ works, imbuing them with a unique character missing on earlier recordings. “The story of Volume 18 is Bob Dylan becoming Bob Dylan,” Sean Wilentz tells Billboard ’s Behind the Setlist podcast. Wilentz, author of the 2010 book Dylan in America , wrote Volume 18 &#8216;s detailed, often fascinating 125-page liner notes that provides historical context for the expansive eight-CD set. “It&#8217;s about his coming of age, his maturation — first as a performer and then as a songwriter — to become the person that we think of [today].” With Dylan surrounded by folk, blues, jazz and comedians such as Lenny Bruce, his artistic growth began immediately upon arriving…",
