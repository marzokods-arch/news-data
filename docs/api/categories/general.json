    "body": "TL;DR Android 17 is said to be shifting away from flat design toward translucent, blur-heavy visuals. Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

In his Galaxy A56 5G review , my colleague Ryan Haines found that the phone’s mediocre performance, lack of wireless charging, and limited camera capabilities hold it back considerably. But above all, one of the A56’s most significant problems is that it’s outdone by the competition.",

Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time. Now, it’s showing up on devices with Android 16, like the OnePlus Pad 3 , as spotted by our colleague AssembleDebug.

Despite being a Google product, the saving feature is currently live only on iPhone and iPad. Google says Android support is coming, with signs of active development, but there’s no release date. Google Photos has reached a creative milestone that many users have been waiting for. You can now save your custom stickers in Collections, making them easy to use in chats whenever you want. There is one catch, and it’s a familiar one. The update is available on iOS, but Android users still do not have access, as per a Google Photos Community post .",

The update is rolling out now on Rapid Release domains and coming to all users in February. Google Chat is finally getting message forwarding.

Google’s also built in some clever protections to make sure you don’t accidentally share info with the wrong people. In a blog post this week, Google outlined the new option. It appears when you click the three dots that appear when you click individual messages, just above the option to copy a link to that message.",

They’re designed so you can hear your surroundings while listening, with three sound modes to suit your environment. Pricing starts at $229.99 in the US and $299.99 in Canada. Sony is back with another entry in its LinkBuds lineup, and this one is a slight departure from the traditional earbud design. The new LinkBuds Clip are open-ear earbuds that don’t sit in your ear canal or hook over your ear. Instead, they clip onto your ear like a cuff, with the idea being that you can listen to music while still hearing what’s going on around you.",

A few weeks back, that option seems to have gone away for everyone, replaced with an on-device “nightlight” mode. While not yet confirmed, the timing of this change and the rise of Gemini for Home feel possibly related. Gemini has arrived for Google Home, and that’s changing the experience for users everywhere — for better or for worse. While Gemini offers the possibility of much richer AI interactions, users have been worried about losing valued functionality along the way, like Assistant’s useful Continued Conversation mode. Google’s made a pretty strong commitment to supporting its older smart home hardware , but the question of third-party support has been less certain. Today we’re checking out what appears to be one big downgrade that’s hitting just such a third-party device. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Multiview was exclusive to live sports streams until last year, when YouTube TV started allowing select non-sports content in multiview layouts. Today, YouTube announced that it’s lifting more restrictions on the feature with an update in the near future. The announcement came in a blog post detailing YouTube ‘s priorities for the year.

Ever since smartphones started getting really powerful, some of us have been wondering why we need so many other computers in our lives. Instead of a smartphone, plus a laptop, and maybe even a desktop computer at home, couldn’t we have this one convenient, portable handset just act as our primary computing device, and connect it to larger screens, keyboards, and mice as we liked? Companies have been trying to offer just that sort of experience for well over a decade now — to varying degrees of success — and now we’re checking out the latest attempt from Nex Computer: the NexPhone .
