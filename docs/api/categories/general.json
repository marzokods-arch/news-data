If you're interested in oddities from the period you probably know Inscape as the publisher of the aforementioned Drowned God, but also Bad Day on the Midway, which was directed by members of surrealist rock troupe The Residents, and almost received a TV adaptation by—take a breath—David Lynch. Inscape was a dab hand at sicko-friendly adventures in other words, which can probably be attributed to its proximity with the film and music worlds (it was funded by HBO and Warner Music Group). Which brings us to The Dark Eye. This 1995 point 'n' click adventure is based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, and features voice acting by writer and artist William S. Burroughs.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding. Chet has been unsettled for a while, but when he finds the missing Woody's eyeglasses in the garbage disposal, …",

Case in point: comedy adventure Earth Must Die from Size Five Games, which launches today. As noted on its Steam page , the game contains \"an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor,\" and that description seems to have raised at least one questioning eyebrow at Valve HQ. According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

PC Gamer's Morgan Park was there , and disgraced streamer Guy Beahm, better known to the online world as Dr Disrespect, was not—which might seem like an odd thing to say, except, well, he said he was. The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend.

    "body": "World of Warcraft: Midnight , the incoming expansion for the two-decade-plus MMO, will be taking players back to Silvermoon—that's been known for some time, but it's also a bit of a continued experiment. See, WoW's a wizened beast with expansions in the double digits to its name, and if you keep slapping continents on the old girl, it's going to stop feeling like a World of Warcraft and more like a hodgepodge...er, of Warcraft. Anyway, we know that we're going to get a redesigned Northrend again for the next next expansion , The Last Titan, but Blizzard's also considering taking a new lick of paint to some long-standing cities, too; beloved places that haven't seen an overhaul since Cataclysm which, not to make you feel old or nothin', came out 16 whole years ago. That's per our cover feature for the upcoming issue of PC Gamer, written by PCG contributor Heather Newman. In it, Heather spoke to both manager for visual development Gabriel Gonzalez and Paul Kubit, associate game director and lead on the expansion itself. \"It was a little scary, honestly, to go back in to tackle that zone again,\" says Gonzalez regarding Silvermoon and the Ghostlands, given their nostalgia-drenched pos…",

    "body": "Word reached me this morning that hot new PvP raid shooter Highguard has an unusual bug. According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

With a bunch of big successes under its belt, you might expect CEO Tim Bender to be looking to expand, swallowing up more and more indie games to increase his chances of finding another hit. But not only is he completely disinterested in publishing more than around 10 games a year, focusing on stability over growth , his advice to indie developers is to avoid indie publishers entirely. \"People can hate me for this if they want,\" he says, \"but most indie publishers are not people indie developers should work with. The vast majority of indie publishers, in their whole structure, are predatory and opportunistic.\" This could all be a cunning ploy to stick it to the competition, but Hooded Horse isn't exactly struggling to find developers to sign. Bender's warning to devs is also consistent with the rest of his publishing philosophy, where \"ethical treatment of developers is critical\". He wants to be a positive influence, he says, as evidenced by his championing of fair contracts where developers don't need to wait for the publisher to recoup …",

It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map.
