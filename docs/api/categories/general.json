Like the ROG Xbox Ally X, it packs a Z2 Extreme chip, but with a better screen and more RAM. Pricing will start at $1,049, with availability starting in October. It’s been nearly nine months since Lenovo first showed off the Legion Go 2 prototype at CES, but at long last, it’s finally here to take the spotlight. And boy was it worth it. The updated Windows handheld features top-notch specs across the board. We don’t have all of the SKUs yet, but the specs announced at IFA today list “up to” the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme and 32GB of RAM. The ROG Xbox Ally X, which was finally revealed last month , ships with the same chip, but maxes out at 24GB of RAM.",

A high-quality, top-tier robot vacuum cleaner is one of the best upgrades you can make to your house. It dramatically simplifies cleaning routines while saving you a lot of time and effort. But not every home is built the same — some of us have larger houses, and a robot vacuum that spends half its time charging up may not serve us that well. ECOVACS is solving for that with the latest DEEBOT X11, which debuts with GaN fast charging so it can spend less time charging and more time cleaning. ECOVACS DEEBOT X11 features At IFA 2025, ECOVACS launched the DEEBOT X11 with GaN fast charging technology. This technology allows the robot vacuum cleaner to rapidly recharge its battery (up to 6% battery in three minutes) during short docking cycles, like mop rinsing.

The Galaxy Tab S11 replaces the Plus model in a more compact form but with similar power to the Ultra. The Ultra has a massive 14.6-inch display and is both thinner and lighter than last year’s model. Samsung is refreshing its flagship Android tablet lineup today with the introduction of the new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. These tablets come with incremental changes over the previous Galaxy Tab S10 series, and we’ll walk you through all of those. Let’s start with the immediately apparent change: the naming. With this launch, Samsung is eliminating the Plus variant — for now, at least — and reviving the standard Galaxy Tab S11, which features a smaller 10.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution. A similar lineup rejig is expected of the Galaxy S26 series , where Samsung is likely to eliminate the Galaxy S26 Plus and rename the base Galaxy S26 to S26 Pro.",

It’s an incredible piece of hardware, and you’re probably itching to download your favorite apps, sign into your accounts, and start snapping photos. Before you dive in, though, a handful of settings can drastically improve your day-to-day experience. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, Google leaves them turned off by default. Changing these settings can do everything from improving your battery’s long-term health, saving you storage space, organizing your home screen, and making sure you never miss an important notification again.",

The string of new Android gaming handheld announcements continues, this time with ANBERNIC getting in on the action. Its latest handheld is called the RG 476H, and it might be the best possible combination of the company’s past few handhelds. With an all-glass front, the RG 476H is one of the most modern-looking handhelds in ANBERNIC’s lineup. That said, it’s still going to be focused on retro games, with a D-pad-centric layout and what appears to be a 4:3 aspect ratio. We can also see stacked triggers, rather than the in-line triggers found on its last release, the RG 477M. In many ways, it looks like a smaller AYANEO Pocket S2 .",

Google has recently updated a support page , with changes indicating that “Everything Else” on Google Wallet is starting to roll out to other regions. More specifically, the instructions on the page for adding an image to Google Wallet have been tweaked.

Check if ChatGPT is down Give ChatGPT some time to recover Check your internet connection Log out and log back in Try incognito mode or a different browser Use the ChatGPT smartphone app Clear your browser’s settings and cache Try a ChatGPT alternative Check if ChatGPT is down The first thing you should do is check if the servers hosting ChatGPT itself are down right now or facing connectivity issues.
