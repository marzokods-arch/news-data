To serve as the battleground for this existential conflict, the Hokkaido map has been remixed into Popsomp Hills Asylum, an \"environment where doctors, patients, and performers blur into one,\" where Slim Shady \"delivers erratic live performances to a captive audience of staff and inmates.\" Presumably, Agent 47 thinks this is cool and fine. I don't know what force or magic has hewn Eminem into a bifurcated being at war with himself. I only know that, as of today, it is my duty, obligation, and sacred calling to kill Slim Shady with mom's spaghetti. The \"surreal new mission,\" IO Interactive sa…",

Shortly after the success of Vampire Survivors, Luca \"was already thinking of getting in touch with other indie studios to start working on spin-offs,\" so the idea behind Vampire Crawlers has been gestating for about four years. He suggests it's just one of many prototypes they've had in development, but the marriage of Vampire Survivors' spiraling chaos and a first-person roguelike just worked immediately. \"To some people this game will look like a 'blobber', a half-unknown genre that us…",

MrBeast, or Jimmy Donaldson, revealed the scope of attractions in Beast Land (and the game-oriented in-park land Beast Zone) earlier this month in a thread on X . The games on offer include Drop Zone, where players aim to be the last person standing atop a series of trap doors, and Airmail, where players drop a \"weighted bag\" from a zipline onto a target below. As reported by Kotaku , the park also features thrill rides, photo-op set pieces where you can pretend to hold Feastables with MrBeast himself, a seemingly endless spew of branded merchandise, and a stash of 1 million Saudi Riyal, or roughly $266,000 USD, which will go to the highest scoring Arena players.

    "body": "Whenever a new Overwatch hero is on the horizon, everyone tries to guess which of the three roles they'll fit into. There's been a pattern ever since Overwatch 2 came out where Blizzard releases at least one tank, one support, and one damage-dealer every year. Blizzard has never explicitly stated it was intentional, but fans have assumed it cycled through the roles to keep the number of heroes in each role balanced. Overwatch has always had significantly more damage heroes than the rest, but everyone accepted that as a consequence of it being the most popular role. The hero release pattern isn't a hard rule, Blizzard tells PC Gamer in a recent interview. And that's why its next hero, Vendetta , isn't a tank as many players expected. She'll be the game's first purely melee-based damage hero, a fantasy that the developers couldn't pass up. \"I saw a lot of very confident expectations that hero 45 was going to be a tank based off of a recent release pattern that we're now switching up a little bit,\" senior character artist Bryan Bedford says. \"But I think one of the most important aspects of adding a new hero is honestly just coming up with something that's fun to play.\" Associate gam…",

Valve's cute little cube will run SteamOS and use Proton—a compatibility layer to make Windows games play nice with Linux—but you can't play official Rust using it. The latest plea for official Proton support started on Reddit , where Scout339v2 shared their screenshot of Rust running \"on a server with EAC disabled to show that the game already works perfectly on Linux.\" Disabling Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is the key factor here, and part of a broader conversation where Facepunch and its Linux/Proton userbase don't see eye-to-eye. While it's true Rust runs on Proton, you can't join official servers, and most unofficial servers, with EAC disabled. Facepunch considered changing its stance in 2022 when the Steam Deck launched, but didn't end up introducing official Proton support. COO Alistair McFarlane said at the time that Linux is \"safer for cheat developers,\" and that trying to support EAC on another platform could reduce the team's ability to support Windows.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. If I were to show you a tiny sliver of a screenshot from a game like Counter-Strike or Minecraft or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you could probably identify it easily, even without context. The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.) Remember, not every letter I show you is the first letter of the game name! And B sure to let us know how U scored in the comments, K?",

Check the subreddit or the Steam forums and you'll see threads of befuddled players with titles like \"Goose??\" and \"please be careful around geese\" and \"throw every goose you see.\" Where Winds Meet isn't really a game about killing wildlife, but like the chickens in Zelda games, these geese pack a punch. Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it. For whatever reason, geese can drown in the world of Where Winds Meet. They won't even attempt to escape as they slowly take damage and fa…",

The 2000s were a time of social, political, and cultural transfiguration: The global paradigm was reeling beneath the impact of 9/11 and the United States' ensuing War on Terror, the internet was ascending as the universal medium of informational and commercial exchange, and everywhere people wondered: How would director Peter Jackson follow his success with the landmark Lord of the Rings trilogy?

Some people even had meetings in Red Dead Online. That energy for makeshift avatar office culture didn't really last, and I've felt a lingering loneliness in working from home even though I prefer it to a commute. Trends like body-doubling haven't caught my interest, but what has grabbed me by the throat and not let go is an adorable \"cozy multiplayer productivity game\" called On-Together that's made my work week 100% more social and more productive.

Over 500 reviews, not a single one of them negative. That is until this week, when one cook spoiled the broth with a red thumbs-down among the sea of blue approval. The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews?
