Kristofferson, known for elevating the craft of songwriting with his poetic approach and songs such as &#8220;Sunday Morning Coming Down&#8221; and &#8220;For the Good Times,&#8221; died in 2024. During the Nashville Songwriter Awards, Lukas Nelson honored the late Kristofferson with a performance of Kristofferson&#8217;s 1971 hit “Loving Her Was Easier (Than Everything I’ll Ever Do Again)”. “He changed what you can write in this town,” Bart Herbison, executive director of NSA…",

Last autumn, six months after beginning her solo career, the singer and Little Mix member pretty much resigned herself to life as a recluse, spending the majority of her time in her Cheshire house. Travelling to London for work would trigger her agoraphobia – an anxiety disorder characterised by a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult – so her home recording space, named Studio 22, became a hideout whenever she felt overwhelmed. In April 2024, the singer (known mononymously as Perrie) released her strident debut single “Forget About Us,” which was co-written by Ed Sheeran, and hit No. 10 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart . From an outside perspective, as the summer rolled on, it seemed as though things were in motion: she was active on social media and delivered a series of radio appearances, including a set at Wembley Stadium as part of Capital’s Summertime Ball, delivering a viral powerhouse cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” All the while, things began to unravel behind the scenes.

When the system can’t make a prediction on its own, users have been asked to provide documentation proving their age. For those who haven’t, many have started seeing their YouTube accounts locked down to child settings. YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone. The site has long struggled to take appropriate measures to protect its young and vulnerable users, while still letting adults enjoy more mature material — within reason. Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history. When that fails, or Google’s unable to make a guess with much confidence, YouTube offers these users the opportunity to manually establish their age by submitting something like an…",

We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect.

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging. Xiaomi has confirmed that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 series is fully compatible with 100W PPS charging.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is testing a new setting in One UI 8.5 that allows temporarily disabling the Auto Blocker feature. Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

The H15 Pro CarpetFlex comes with a special brush that ensures dry scrubbing on carpeted floors. It comes in a cordless design and can operate even while lying flat at 180º, reaching under furniture. If your home has a combination of hard and carpet flooring, you’ve probably had to rely on specialized equipment to ensure the latter gets a deeper cleaning. That could likely change with a new cordless vacuum cleaner from Dreame that ensures seamless cleaning on both surfaces. Dreame has launched the H15 Pro CarpetFlex, a wet-and-dry vacuum cleaner with a cardless design. While the standard H15 Pro heat is designed for hard and engineered floors, the CarpetFlex is made for flatter floors and softer surfaces, such as rugs and carpets.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The “Now Playing” feature on Google Pixel devices is missing a key feature after a recent Android System Intelligence update. With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

Pre-orders start on October 10 at $79.90, with shipping starting November 10. The budget Android gaming handheld market has burst wide open in the past few weeks. Sub-$100 devices like the MANGMI AIR X and AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini are poised to take entry-level handhelds to the next level, but there’s now a new challenger with a completely different approach. The MagicX One35 is a small handheld with a 3.5-inch IPS touchscreen display in a horizontal layout, but one thing makes it stand out from any other handheld on the market. Rather than dual joysticks, it includes two D-pads: one on the left in the upper position and another beneath the face buttons on the right.",
