Absolum is a brilliantly clever hybrid of classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up combat with a roguelike framework, and I'm not sure it ever quite got the buzz it deserved. It seems like it found an audience, at least, with 500,000 players , a 94% positive rating on Steam and apparently enough success to fuel a new free update . Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Arriving on February 12, the 1.1 patch will make further tweaks and fixes, but more importantly add a raft of new content to give the experience even more replayability. \"Mystic Ordeals\" are customisable modifiers you can apply to runs after you've beaten the final boss, so you can keep testing your skills. And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process. The update's also adding elite mounts—rarer versions with upgraded attacks—as well as new emotes for co-op play and unlockable character skins. …",

You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",

Its Xbox hardware revenue continues to fall and even its overall gaming services revenues are on the slide. Xbox hardware revenues are reportedly down by 32% in the final quarter of 2025, while overall gaming revenue was down 9%. Microsoft also says in its earnings release that Xbox content and services revenue, including Game Pass, were down by 5%. So, basically anything to do with Xbox and gaming for Microsoft is on the slide, though as The Verge notes, Microsoft isn't releasing any information on Xbox Game Pass membership rates. That obviously makes it difficult to gauge the impact of the Game Pass Ultimate price hike , which wasn't exactly warmly received by gamers. Microsoft's whole Xbox endeavour, of course, is currently in flux. The company has continued to publish more games for play on Sony's competing PS5 console as part of its broader—and some would argue, incredibly confusing—\" This is an Xbox \" push to redefine what an Xbox means.

I guess Ubi's loosened up since then, because the official Assassin's Creed X account is now posting GTA memes about yet another possible leak. AC fan account Zephryss posted images of a statuette of Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, writing that it \"might be the new Edward Kenway figurine for the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake\" and had been found by fans on second-hand site Vinted. In response, the AC account posted that old classic: CJ returning to San Andreas with the subtitles \"Ah shit, here we go again.\" For reference, this would be the second time this remake has been leaked by a statue , if genuine.

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

    "body": "Remember that Bloober Team countdown with the bizarre URL that kicked off at the end of 2025? It grew a little more elaborate today, with additional images and spooky vocalizing, and some old-time horror fans are hoping the studio is teasing a very unexpected remake of the controversial 2006 PlayStation 2 horror game Rule of Rose. First noticed by Shinobi602 on Bluesky , Bloober's countdown website at remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com (which as far as I know remains undeciphered) now features a stylized image of a rose, and the message \"Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.\" Put your cursor on the rose and it drips some kind of liquid—blood, I suppose. (Image credit: Bloober Team) There's also a similarly drippy \"play\" button on the page, which if clicked delivers a scratchy message that a quick search reveals is an overwrought recitation of a William Blake poem, The Sick Rose , originally published in 1794 as part of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection: O Rose thou art sick.

    "body": "I like the horse in Highguard. The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on. The end result feels a bit like…",

    "body": "Five unions representing Ubisoft employees in France have called for a \"massive international strike by all Ubisoft employees\" in response to the company's recently-announced restructuring and return to office mandate. Ubisoft announced the overhaul of its studio structure last week, a process that includes the cancellation of six games in development (including the repeatedly-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), multiple delays, and the closures of \"several studios,\" with attendant layoffs. It followed that up with a demand that all employees return to full time in-office work , and then initiated a 'Rupture Conventionnelle Collective' process in order to reduce the workforce at its Paris HQ by 200 people. Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",

The early details for this month's PC-specific follow-up patch, which touted additional graphics and CPU options alongside the vague promise of yet more \"CPU/GPU optimization,\" didn't inspire confidence either. I'm pleased to say that, for once, I was wrong to doubt. The Steam-centric patch arrived last night, and—while I wish it hadn't taken almost a year for me to be able to write this—it certainly seems like a Monster Hunter Wilds performance improvement patch has finally, substantially improved performance. Sometimes when a patch note says \"CPU/GPU optimization,\" it really means it. (Image credit: Capcom) Still, I'm going to ask that we all limit any sudden movements or loud noises.

These games can be as scary as it gets, and Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly is one of the most downright freaky there is. Publisher Koei Tecmo and its Team Ninja studio are in the final stages of a remake, imaginatively enough called Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, and has today announced a new demo for the game, as well as a collaboration with Silent Hill f. The secret sauce with Fatal Frame is that you don't have anything in the way of traditional weaponry, but you do have the Camera Obscura, a device that can…. I dunno, capture the souls of ghosts and monsters. It's a brilliant mechanic because, at the very moment you want to clench your butt cheeks and run, you've got to stay still, line up the perfect snap, and then hopefully get it right.
