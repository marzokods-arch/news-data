It’s the owner of Monopoly Go creators Savvy Games Group, has stakes in Nintendo, Embracer Group, Capcom, and Take-Two, among many others,and most recently was involved in the $55 billion joint acquisition of Electronic Arts . But all that spending may be catching up with the PIF, as a new report suggests that it is running low on cash for further investments. According to the New York Times (via GamesIndustry ) the PIF is restricting operations under the eye of Crown Prince Mohammed, as numerous projects it has invested in are under \"financial distress\". It's worth noting that none of these distressed investments are directly related to gaming. Troubled projects include Saudi Arabia's ambitious (some may say preposterous) city construction project Neom , with its plans for a 105 mile, glass-walled city called \"The Line\" being massively scaled back . Other struggling investments cited by the NYT include a coffee chain with just one shop, a cruise line with one lonely ship, and \"an electric vehicle start-up begun three years ago that has yet to deliver a car.\" The …",

You can find Thomas in everything from Hogwarts Legacy to Elden Ring , but it all began with a 2013 Skyrim mod that replaced all dragons with the resplendent blue engine, as well as adding sound effects from the show. That Skyrim mod was down to game developer and modder Trainwiz (and friends), who notes in his Bluesky bio that \"Mattel is out to kill me.\" This is because toy giant Mattel owns the rights to the Thomas the Tank Engine characters, and doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humour about Thomas mods. Thus, we arrive at a new frontier for Thomas-based heroics. Trainwiz has popped up with a new mod for Morrowind that \"replaces cliff racers with Thomas the Tank Engine.\" Cliff racers are flying creatures that appear all around the Vvardenfell region of Morrowind, and occasionally swarm the player. The reason that you can now get got by countless flying Thomases?

After a limited bit of rearranging of the order, you can decide whether to buy or sit out. Buy, and you'll invest all your money into the stock, let the cards play out, and then sell it—hoping its value at that stage is higher than when you started.

It's back in GOG Preservation Program form. In other words, GOG's done some work on this one. \"The new GOG release of Cold Fear isn’t just a reappearance on a storefront—it’s a quality re-release with extensive under-the-hood work,\" reads the blurb. That means Windows 10/11 support, support for 4K and high refresh rates, modern controller support, and patches for common crashes and glitches—just generally the gubbins you need to launch a game with confidence on a PC in 2025. You can find the full changelog on GOG . Also, it's not alone. Alongside the Cold Fear re-release, GOG's adding Ubisoft's 2012 action-adventure game I Am Alive to its storefront and lineup of preserved titles. That game has gotten a spit-polish too, with support for online achievements, cloud saves, high refresh rates, modern controllers, and various bugfixes and such. As a 2005 game, our review of Cold Fear is lost to the mists of time (that's what we call the closet filled with the last 30-plus years of magazines), but our review of I Am Alive is…",

A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on.

The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed.

Players found themselves unable to log in, with demand being such that developer Battlestate Games acknowledged severe server woes , and then came the inevitable review bombing from those who couldn't play. Welcome to Steam, comrade! \"What a week,\" wrote director and Battlestate COO Nikita Buyanov on X . \"This week was actual stress testing not only of our servers but also our mind and nerves for sure. But seeing you enjoy the game makes us feel better.\" Stuff like server issues and bugs can be fixed, of course, though people also have issues with Tarkov's full release that aren't going away: primarily, existing owners having to re-buy the game on Steam. That's not going to change, though presumably the disquiet will die down over time (and while it would've been nice, existing owners can of course still play through the Battlestate launcher). Buyanov went on to discuss the near future for the game in the runup to the new year, though stopped short of offering any details on the long-teased Scav Life DLC, w…",

When it finally burst from its coffin, the critical reaction ranged from mildly positive to firmly negative, with our own Fraser Brown giving it a respectable score of 78 in our Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 review. Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem. Speaking to Cat Burton of the Goth Boss Podcast (via PCGamesN ) TCR cofounder Dan Pinchbeck explained how he urged Paradox Interactive not to call Bloodlines 2, well, that .

Granted, setting up the emulation in the first place is not a simple task and requires some brain-busting tinkering, but it's becoming more and more worthwhile since this time last year, when Bloodborne was first playable , though with caveats and crashes galore . There are also comprehensive guides available to steer you through the process of setting up the emulator and patching the game. A new video from tabeneru showcases a side-by-side comparison between the previous and current version of ShadPS4 on a PC equipped with Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU at 1440p with the framerate unlocked. Bloodborne's performance is far more stable now, more than doubling its average fps in some instances—far and away from sub double-figure lows.

In a post on The Crew Unlimited's website (via RPS ), Crew curator whammy4 details what they describe as \"one of the most important updates we've ever released.\" Whammy4 explains that, not long after TCU's launch in September, the team realised that \"if your PC date is set to post June 2029 … The Crew stops working.\" Why anyone would have their PC's date set to beyond June 2029 is beyond me, so I'm not going to call the situation urgent , exactly. But the presence of such a bug will obviously become a much bigger problem in about three-and-a-half years' time. Naturally, The Crew's saviours were \"extremely concerned\" for the long-term health of the game, and investigated further: \"At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end,\" by which whammy4 means the server created by the TCU team to get the game r…",

Alinea estimates that Steam has churned out about $16.2 billion in revenue in 2025, over $4 billion of which went to Valve itself (Valve, notoriously, takes a 30% cut on Steam purchases, a number that only gets lower after your product has raked in over $10 million).
