HDR content certainly has its place, but on our phones, it can sometimes be more of a nuisance than a benefit. As part of its One UI 7 update earlier this year, Samsung added a “Super HDR” toggle to its Galaxy phones, allowing you to disable overly bright HDR content. Now, Google Pixel phones have a similar feature called “Enhanced HDR brightness.”",

I really, truly believe that the Pixel is in its best position in several years, with a steadily improving chipset and cameras that continue to get smarter.

Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours.

Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers.

On paper, it’s a device with a clean look, built-in Google TV , and 3LCD tech for avoiding the rainbow artifacts common in lifestyle models. In practice, it not only lived up to its specs but also naturally slipped into everyday use.",

I pinged a few members of the SoundGuys crew and checked in with our own Rita El Khoury, whose gadget tastes often match my own.

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR Some Pixel owners say the December update stopped the notification shade from opening normally in One-Handed Mode. Reports span several models, but others say theirs still works, so the issue isn’t universal. Google hasn’t documented any changes to One-Handed Mode; we’ve reached out to the company for comment. A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",

Both smartwatches are expected to launch around July 2026 alongside Samsung’s next foldables. Samsung expanded its smartwatch lineup with the launch of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, directly competing with the Apple Watch Ultra. Much like Apple, Samsung has barely refreshed the Galaxy Watch Ultra this year, giving it more storage and a new color, but nothing else. Are we in for another refresh next year? A new leak is giving us positive news, as it seems the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 is in the works, and it could bring some upgrades. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Between the fantastic camera zoom, variety of video capture options, and premium extras, there was a lot to like. The X200 Pro wasn’t perfect, though. A weird glare issue on the primary camera, along with plenty of bloat, a dearth of AI features, and a ho-hum update pledge sullied the otherwise great package. Now, vivo has launched the X300 Pro, its next flagship phone for global markets. So does the new phone pick up the baton and run even faster, or does it stumble and fall in a heap? I took it for a spin for a few weeks to find out.",

    "summary": "A top engineer from Steam's maker reveals the company's contribution to mobile gaming.",
    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Steam’s maker, Valve, has been playing a huge role in Windows emulation on Android. Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.
