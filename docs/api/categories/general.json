The devices are claimed to feature a 50Hz E Ink refresh rate and run Android. Pricing, launch date, availability, and processor details remain unannounced. DASUNG is gearing up for a new addition to its Not-eReader lineup, teasing what it calls the Revolutionary Edition. The China-based e-ink specialist hasn’t released official specifications or a launch date yet, but early reports suggest the company could be preparing to push its e-paper tech further than before. The new lineup is set to include two models, a 7.8-inch “078” and a 10.3-inch “103.” The devices are teased as boasting a 50Hz refresh rate, a claim that, if accurate, would represent a significant step forward for E ink responsiveness. Smoother scrolling and less ghosting are hot-ticket upgrades and would certainly give the DASUNG devices an edge over current offerings. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Telecom providers can exploit a hidden Android feature to show you an “inflated” signal strength. AT&amp;T and Verizon have already been spotted using this tactic. Telecom carriers often battle over broader coverage, the number of zip codes covered by 5G , and faster speeds. These claims, based on the carriers’ own marketing teams, paint a picture that’s far from the actual scenario and are often even contradicted in actual reports by independent parties . However, while it’s natural for corporations to paint a brighter picture, Google has been found colluding with carriers, allowing them to display fake signal strength on your phone. Beyond tall marketing claims and fake 5G icons , carriers may also be lying through their teeth to you about signal strength. A recent report by Nick vs Networking highlights a flag, KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL , in the source code for Android’s Carrier Config Manager, related to artificially “inflating” the network strength.",

The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

With its upcoming One UI 8.5 interface , Samsung could be taking a bold step towards reshaping the interface that has remained largely unchanged for the past two generations. Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

Starting with the SoC, the 8 Elite Gen 5 is the latest and greatest on the market, with our early testing indicating a 20% bump in CPU and GPU performance in reference devices for testing.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

    "body": "Recently, I reported that AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon had all released their Q3 2025 financial results. Verizon’s rivals are doing well, but Big Red finds itself in a much less rosy position. While it did manage to add more than 40,000 new subscribers this quarter, those gains came entirely from its prepaid and business divisions. Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Google has been working to bring its latest Material 3 Expressive aesthetics across multiple apps and interfaces. While Android phones have been the blessed recipients of the new design language, Google has also begun painting elements from the smaller screen with similar visuals. The Pixel Watch 4 is splattered with a healthy dose of the Expressive design, thanks to its Wear OS 6 interface . Meanwhile, Google has also been testing a design revamp for apps such as Maps , even on older versions of Wear OS. Apps, such as Google Calendar , Home, Keep, Messages , and Gemini for Watch , already have the updated visuals. Now, YouTube Music on Wear OS is getting a similar treatment.",

Sure, it’s easy to complain about all the things we might not like about one particular UI, but there’s a big difference between being able to express some criticism and building something that everyone’s going to like. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
