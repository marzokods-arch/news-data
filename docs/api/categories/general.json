The speedrunning community is already at it (via Eurogamer ) with Silksong, rapidly uncovering a myriad of techniques that we'll all one day gawp at during an upcoming Awesome Games Done Quick. It's cool as hell, but I will never have the manual dexterity or mental energy to use any of these tactics. The work is taking place anywhere two or more Silksong fans are gathered, of course, but (oddly enough) you can get a great overview of the Silksong speedrunning community's work in the speedrunning channel on the Hollow Knight Discord and in the Hollow Knight Speedrun and Racing Community. So far, the mad lads have uncovered strats to travel at faster-than-sprinting speeds by combining jumping and sprinting, access ability-gated areas early by cunningly bouncing off well-placed flying enemies , and figured out you can just jump off spikes , I guess. That last one feels like it might get patched, but who knows? These early days are anarchy. My favourite, though, is this method for just absolutely clowning on poor Moorwing, t…",

It doesn't help that he constantly smashes the platform you're standing on so you fall into the lava. If you haven't reached this point yet or got the Drifter's Cloak, you'll need to find some Hokers before you can escape the Far Fields.

Don't worry though: not only does Silksong have a map, but it can be very useful so long as you cough up some rosaries ASAP. After about an hour in Silksong you'll encounter the NPC Shakra in The Marrow—listen out for the lovely yodelling. After some dialogue they'll offer to sell you a bunch of map-centric stuff, and your first instinct might be to ignore it. Of course this metroidvania will just plot out my map as I explore it, right? Nope: not only do you have to buy maps, but you have to buy map markers and other useful icons, such as those demarking resting places. Oh, and you also have to buy the ability to see yourself on the map. Even though Shakra's gear might seem expensive in total, you should 100% buy it all up as soon as you meet them.

Considering he's recently announced that Stardew Valley will be getting a 1.7 update and apparently done a little moonlighting as a bug, I think he might've been onto something. I checked Silksong's credits today to see how many folks contributed to the long-awaited metroidvania outside Team Cherry's core trio, and there's Barone, right alongside several members of designer William Pellen's family. Considering Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight released within a year of each other and both went on to become some of the most successful indie games of all time, I'm not too surprised to see they travel in the same circles. Or at least they're friendly enough that when Team Cherry was in need of \"additional character voices\" for Silksong's new cast of characters, Barone got the call. Or perhaps Barone is such a massive Hollow Knight fan that he begged to go bug mode for the sequel? (Image credit: Team Cherry) If you harbor any doubt that it's the Barone, The…",

This sale coincides with another free weekend, though unlike the last one in late August, this free to play period comes with \" zero restrictions .\" Play as many hours as you want from September 11 to September 15 (the first free weekend, bizarrely, was capped at 10 hours). You can also explore the entire map instead of being stuck in the starting area. \"Venture across every zone in Hagga Basin to the Deep Desert to Harko Village and Arrakeen City,\" Funcom says. Perhaps most importantly, you can play with friends, too, by joining the server they play on—the first free weekend only let you play on servers with other players who were trying the game out, not people who had already bought it. I can only assume this new, free-er weekend is a direct response to the negative feedback from the last one.

The Apple dance, as it became known, was a huge TikTok trend in summer 2024 and has been adopted by Charli XCX herself: Heyer even performed the dance live at one of the star's concerts. It was impossible to avoid at the time, and was subsequently incorporated into a Charli XCX-themed \"Brat\" update for the Roblox game Dress to Impress. The legalities all get a little murky here. Heyer and Roblox were apparently in talks to license the dance in early August last year, but then the update containing the emote was released before any \"signed agreement\", and Heyer subsequently copyrighted the dance. Her lawsuit claimed that Roblox had made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November 2024, and said Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" Well, now she has been, although there's no disclosure of the su…",

With 36,000,000 users online, Steamstat.us currently lists the Steam store as operating at a \"Very slow\" capacity, occasionally ticking over to a concerned, yellow \"Bad gateway\" message. It is worth mentioning, of course, that Hollow Knight: Silksong was never up for pre-order. Anyone who wanted day-one access to the game had to turn up at 15:00 GMT on the dot and buy the dang thing. Would allowing pre-orders, rather than forcing the game's incredibly thirsty fans and legions of curious onlookers to all show up at once, have ameliorated this situation? Probably a bit.

The handheld is demo-ed in a recent video (via NITTRX ), with the creator commenting that playing racing games is \"very exciting.\" And while we're on the subject of peering over from the backseat, the creator has also shared pictures that demonstrate how the handheld is both longer than their rearview mirror and their forearm . This same creator has made a number of charming 'WinMini' handhelds in the past, so it's no surprise that this latest ultrawide effort is similarly Windows-based. The project is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU , the same chip in the MSI Claw A8 and the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds. Throw in detachable controllers alongside a touch screen, and I can't quite tear my eyes away from this DIY project.

The shizzle here involves a couple of new trade mark applications by Valve centred on the term \"Steam Frame\", as spotted on Reddit yesterday . The more interesting and specific of the two says, \"STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.\" That's about as unambiguous as it gets. Of course, applying for a trade mark doesn't guarantee that trade mark gets used. It could even be an intentional distraction designed to draw attention away from some other naming scheme or project.

This week I've been: planning builds for every single skill tree in Borderlands 4, hoping it would help me pick a character, but actually leaving me more conflicted. Most Borderlands fans would say that the game only really gets going once you've finished the campaign and reached the endgame, and I'd agree; that's when you officially start grinding post-campaign activities and gearing up your Vault Hunter. That's not changed in Borderlands 4 . In fact, it's getting a handful of really great changes that'll make it hard to go back to previous games. I'm glad that we're finally able to skip the campaign and jump straight to level 30 on alternate characters, making playing all four characters a much more enjoyable experience. Likewise, I love that gear score doesn't increase with each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode tier, so you don't need to re-farm gear each time you climb up the ranks anymore. Perhaps best of all, the new Wildcard Missions are full of potential. You'll need to complete these capstone challenges to…",

In a chat with PCGamesN , Zenimax studio game director Rich Lambert said the low profile of TESO is \"the biggest chip on my shoulder.\" Lambert—who served as TESO's director in a previous life—says the game is \"either not taken seriously or dismissed or whatnot\" and that fact has \"always kind of befuddled me.\" Worse than that, though: Lambert says it's not all that uncommon to run into people who aren't even aware the game is out, 11 years on from release. \"I've been in countless interviews and at countless shows over the years where they're like 'Oh, when does this come out?'

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay Portal are my blocker of choice, as they're the most effective at reducing outside noise and jet turbine rumble to the bare minimum. So, you might be surprised to hear my rally against noise cancelling headphones for gaming, but let me explain. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is when the headset uses microphones and onboard processing to counteract outside interference. It's quite literally cancelling the noise out with an equal and opposite soundwave. There are multiple types of ANC: feed-forward, which uses a microphone outside the device to pickup external noise; and feed-back, which listens closely to what's happening closer to the listener's ear canal to more accurately counteract what's actually seeping in. The best systems often use a combination of both and adapt how they use each technology for better results. That's what the Beoplay Portal offers, so it's a great example of wha…",
