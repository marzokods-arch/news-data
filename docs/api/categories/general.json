Although the demo only whisks you through a portion of the game, it's enough to get a feel for just what awaits you in this frilly, fast-paced shooter.

Speaking to PCG's Ian Evenden for our upcoming issue 415 , however, creative director Dennis Lenart says it was originally designed to be a live-action series. \"We originally started in 2018,\" says Lenart. \"It was going to be a potential live-action interactive TV show. And we spent a bunch of time on that, you know, wrote a season’s worth of content, and a thing called Covid hit. Hollywood shut down, everything changed, the tech partner we were working with pivoted their business, and we kind of put it on the shelf for a while.\" Unless you were born in 2021 (in which case, where are your parents and why are you reading our website?), you'll probably remember the absolute chaos that tore through basically…",

It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage.

A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists.

Our Dave has reviewed a very similar model and likes the value proposition you get when you take into account that mega GPU, although it is a bit of a hairdryer on full whack. Still, stick it in Balanced mode and the noise is much more reasonable, and it still performs about as well as the other RTX 5080 machines we've tested. Which is to say, very well indeed.

It's one of our favourite gaming laptops of this generation, mainly because of the sheer value proposition it provides. The RTX 5080-equipped version has been hovering between $2,100 to $2,400 since its release earlier this year, but now it's dropped to $2,000 at Newegg as part of the early Prime Day sales, and that makes it even more of a bargain. Relatively speaking, of course. We're not expecting RTX 5080 laptops to drop much below this price for a while, but $2,000 is …",

What has looked like shooting stars or meteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere has in fact been Starlink satellites burning up in ever greater numbers. According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.

However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds.

Millennia, a Civ-like developed by C Prompt Games and published by Paradox last year just received a final update before being consigned to sink into the lone and level sand. When Phil Iwaniuk reviewed Millennia he called it \"rough-edged but worthwhile\", with complaints about its UI and AI and few other things, but praise for its way of handling progress through the ages and \"city improvement tile system.\" It sounded like the kind of game that could be significantly improved by a few additions, and while it did receive several—the final patch is update eight—it doesn't seem like enough was done to elevate it above the competition. \"With this patch,\" the announcement says, \"we are sadly coming to the end of an age. This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely.\" That announcement highlights …",

Perhaps that's true when you need a game to sell in the tens of millions, but within the same period of time that both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have failed to meet the company's lofty expectations, turn-based RPGs in general have been on such a hot streak that they're making their action contemporaries look dusty by comparison. While in Tokyo last week for TGS I played three turn-based RPGs, and I only realized in hindsight that the genre unintentionally represented most of the demo time I was able to squeeze in when not filming interviews for the PC Gaming Show . All three were fun, completely different, and embody the hot streak that turn-based RPGs have been on for at least the last year. I'm specifically thinking of more Japanese-style RPGs, here, though of course if we jump back to 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 turn-based games don't need much defending. But after all the talk back then about BG3 raising the bar for RPGs as a whole, I've been delighted this year to see …",

More and more games are getting native Linux support, largely due to the popularity of the Steam Deck. For instance, Hollow Knight: Silksong had native Linux support at launch last month, while one hero engineer at Larian delivered us a native version of Baldur's Gate 3 . Cronos: The New Dawn joins a growing list of over 42,000 games on Steam with Linux support. At the time of writing, over 9,000 games are Deck Verified. Currently six out of the top ten games on Steam's U.S. Top Sellers list (not including the Steam Deck itself) are either \"Playable\" or \"Verified\" on Steam Deck.

I resent having enough of an internet poisoned brain to parse that statement, and wanted to know more. For any normal people with healthy relationships reading this, \"gamer word\" is a sarcastic turn of phrase that emerged out of the fracas of influencer PewDiePie's use of a racial slur in a 2017 PUBG Twitch stream, infamously excused by one defender as a \"heated gaming moment.\" Valve added four new maps to Counter-Strike 2 in an update published October 1 : Transit, Golden, Palacio, and Rooftop. These were community maps made official and put into Counter-Strike 2's rotation by Valve. Two days later on October 3, Valve put out a laconic update with just three changes, one of which was \"Removed Transit from official matchmaking.\" Absent explanation from Valve, we can only speculate, but the most likely culprit is the entity name (how an in-game o…",

One scripted, one very-much-not, but two watershed moments in open-world games this decade. Now, as we slouch slowly but surely towards GTA 6 (on console, at least; a PC launch date still lingers in the ether) and the promise of whatever shape its own online offshoot might take, the idea of balancing the invented with the inadvertent excites me to no end. With that in mind, low-key Rockstar partnerships dance at the forefront of my imagination. Wheels of steel (Image credit: Rockstar/Traderrjoe) You see, no matter how well-executed Rockstar's blockbuster GTA Online updates have been in more recent years, there's something brilliant about its most unhinged but unplanned moments on the streets of San Andreas. The game's servers can be harrowing places with infuriating hackers and hoverbike griefers lurking above and below, but sessions often shine in their bouts of unscripted second-t…",
