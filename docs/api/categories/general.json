    "body": "Ten years ago, Latin music experienced a fresh boom in the reggaetón space, especially coming from Medellín. A wave of then-emerging artists, including J Balvin, Maluma and Karol G, were not only making significant strides in the local Colombian music scene, but also preparing for their international leap. Notably, Balvin became the It Guy, powering off the momentum he had in 2015, with two songs reaching No. 1 on the Hot Latin Songs chart: “Ay Vamos” and “Ginza.” The latter bumped Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias’ “El Perdon” from their No. 1 throne after a marathon 30-week rule. “I thought, why not go back to reggaetón? Because when all is said and done, it’s part of our culture as Latins,” the Colombian artist said in a 2016 interview with Billboard . “And finally, the song was so hooky, it worked. Let’s be honest, &#8216;Ginza&#8217; doesn’t really have lyrics to speak of. It’s a party track — a party for reggaetoneros to come out of the closet. We made reggaetón cool again.” Off of its 2015 success, the Japanese-inspired song kicked off 2016 at No. 1, where it spent 11 more weeks, until a new banger arrived: Nicky Jam’s “Hasta El Amanecer,” which topped Hot Latin Songs for 18 n…",

On the surface, the 2006 TV musical dramedy starring Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron in their breakout roles seems no different than any other high school movie. You’ve got shy but brainy new girl Gabriella (Hudgens) and golden boy jock Troy (Efron) who end up together despite their differences. Then there’s Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), the popular diva who tries to rip them apart; Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), Sharpay’s brother and partner-in-crime; and Chad (Corbin Bleu) and Taylor (Monique Coleman), the best friends of the two leads — who give pretty bad advice, but that’s what part of drives the plot forward. What made this film — and the two sequels that came after — unique wasn’t how the characters broke out of their archetypes by the end of the story (which they do), but rather the music that came with it. The first film’s soundtrack topped the Billboard 200, and a handful of its songs hit the top 40 of the Hot 100.

Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

By all accounts, it was a good $500 phone, offering more than enough bang for your buck. Then, it disappeared. Well, Samsung decided not to offer the Galaxy A55 5G in the States, anyway, making its sub-flagship Fan Edition the go-to option instead. And over the course of that break, the affordable Android market has changed entirely. Rivals like OnePlus and Motorola have stepped up their game, and Google’s Pixel A series is better than ever.",

It’s been nearly two years since Google released the Gemini app for Android and enabled users to switch from Assistant to Gemini despite a bunch of limitations and missing features. One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears.

The change builds on last year’s move to give every secondary calendar a dedicated owner. The rollout starts today for personal accounts and on January 27 for Workspace users. It’s pretty easy to create a secondary calendar in Google Calendar and then completely forget about it, but Google is stepping in to tidy things up. The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle. The new update closes a practical gap in that setup by ensuring ownership is visible.",

That was a fantastic start, but there was still a long way to go in terms of expanding compatibility. Earlier this month we saw Google’s efforts begin to bring the upgrade to Pixel 9 phones in Android Canary , and that’s work the company has continued with its more recent Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 release.

Samsung’s Galaxy Ring uses notifications on your phone to keep you up to speed about its battery and connectivity — for example, alerts when battery charge gets down to 15 percent or when connection with the ring has been lost. Today, we’ve seen evidence that those notifications will soon be a little smarter, ideally helping users avoid missing out on tracked health data.

AYANEO held its first product sharing session of the year this morning, and it finally gave us a look at one of the most anticipated small gaming handhelds this year. The Pocket S Mini, which was first teased in September 2025, brings the ultra-premium all-metal design of the Pocket S series down to a size that actually fits in your pocket. The Pocket S Mini has a retro-friendly 4:3 display, although the exact specifications and size have yet to be announced. On stream, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang held the device next to a standard smartphone, and it roughly matched in size. The screen itself is around the same size as the budget Pocket AIR Mini’s 4.2-inch LCD display, although this handheld is much, much more powerful.",

That was far from my only experience, either. From 2021 to 2025, I not only gained long-term experience with three different Flip models, but I also eventually purchased the Galaxy Z Fold 5.",

Foldable users get meaningful tweaks, like control over how many favorite apps appear on the cover screen. However, turning on the blur option can cause animations to freeze and jitter. After weeks of compatibility headaches and half-baked beta support , Home Up — arguably the heart of Galaxy home screen customisation — now works with One UI 8.5 beta and gives you real control over your Galaxy home screen again. If you’ve played around with the One UI 8.5 beta on Galaxy devices, you were probably frustrated when Home Up and a handful of other Good Lock modules broke after the update. For weeks, users saw errors like “not compatible with your new operating system,” basically rendering beloved customisation tools useless.",

Some users report successfully negotiating much higher credits, up to $200, by contacting support. Users can politely request additional compensation via customer service by phone or chat. Verizon had a major outage last week that left a large chunk of its subscribers unable to access its network for many hours across the country. Verizon’s statement said affected users would be offered account credits for the network disruption, which turned out to be a rather paltry $20 per account, regardless of the number of lines. As it turns out, several users report that they could request a higher credit for the outage and get approved for it. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It’s easy to assume that just because the box is sitting in my home or desk, it’s perfectly safe. I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions.

Instead of copying the entire message and then booting the extra text, Google Messages may soon let you just copy the link directly.

Ranging from the annoyingly expensive iPad Pro to the M-series iPad Air, Apple’s tablet has always been the default slate in my bag for a few simple reasons. It wasn’t just the premium choice, it was the safe choice, and frankly, the only choice that made sense if you needed a solid balance of hardware and software. But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool. Making the switch from an iPad to a utilitarian mid-range Android tablet might not please my brand and ecosystem-conscious mind, but the reality is that it does everything I …",

Although this is still a patent, and patents have a tendency to remain theoretical hogwash, there’s actually a reason why this particular one might end up in an actual product like the Pixel 12: the European Union’s battery regulation .
