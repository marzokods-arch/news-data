Freakier Friday , the two-decades-in-the-making sequel to 2003&#8217;s Freaky Friday , reunites Lohan with Jamie Lee Curtis as her mom Tess and introduces a double-body-swap plot line that sees Lohan switching places with Butters as her teen daughter.

During a segment of &#8220;Plead the Fifth&#8221; on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday (Oct. 1), the iconic singer was asked whether their drama began when the superstar rapper allegedly asked her to play his mother in his 2002 autobiographical film 8 Mile . “From what I heard there is truth to that,” Carey told host Andy Cohen. “But I don’t think that he actually… well, who knows who approached who.” Cohen pushed further, asking, “But did that ignite the beef?” Carey responded vaguely, “Um, no. “I mean, maybe. It depends what he’s thinking. I really don’t care. Like, whatever he’s said, then I’m that, fine. Not really. But that’s a rap lyric.” Earlier this summer, music producer Damion “Damizza” Young — who began working with Carey in the late 1980s — claimed on the TFU podcast that he introduced Eminem to the pop superstar. Young claimed Eminem wanted Carey to portray his alcoholic mother in 8 Mile , despite being just four years younger than her. Carey declined the role, which eventually went to Kim Basinger. “Her insecurities kicked in big time,” Young said, also implying that the two late…",

Both pop dynamos had been nominated in all of the Big&nbsp;Four general categories, and for best new artist, they were surrounded by potential spoilers, including Shaboozey, whose “A&nbsp;Bar Song (Tipsy)” had logged the most weeks atop the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100 in 2024; Teddy Swims, whose “Lose Control” eventually broke the Hot&nbsp;100 longevity record; and other new-school stars like Benson Boone, Doechii and RAYE. Ultimately, Roan emerged victorious — and delivered an instantly memorable acceptance speech that advocated for artists’ wages and health care. Eight months later, a fresh class of best new artist hopefuls is eager for such a moment at the 68th annual Grammys — but in a race that looks nothing like the previous one.

Born in Minneapolis and raised in Gainesville, Fla. — his late brother Tom played with fellow Gainesvillian Tom Petty — Leadon grew up steeped in bluegrass and acoustic traditions. His early work with Dillard &amp; Clark and on the Burrito Brothers&#8217; second and third albums fused traditional instrumentation with progressive songwriting, laying the foundation for what would later be dubbed Americana. In 1971, he co-founded the Eagles with Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner, helping craft the band&#8217;s signature sound meshing country and rock. His contributions — on guitar, banjo, pedal steel and mandolin — defined early Eagles albums such as the band&#8217;s self-titled debut, Desperado and One of These Nights .
