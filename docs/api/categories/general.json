    "body": "USB-C is an unfixable mess , that I’m convinced of, but a small part of me saw light at the end of the tunnel — that was until Apple launched the iPhone 17 series. With Apple’s latest phones, it’s now even harder for consumers to find the perfect plug to optimally fast-charge all their gadgets at once. Allow me to explain why. The good news, as it were, is that the iPhone 17 series claims “up to 50% charge in 20 minutes ” with Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter. That’s still not super fast, but it is undoubtedly an improvement on last year’s models, which ended up at around 40% after the same length of time.",

The update also adds compatibility for three tricky Disney Wii games thanks to clever hacks. Bluetooth passthrough, which enables Wii Remote support, has been patched to work with more modern Bluetooth adapters. Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is testing a new search feature that will allow users to search for content in shared albums without saving the photos. We’ve spotted a filter to include and exclude shared photos in the search results Currently, users have to save shared photos to their accounts before they can be searched. Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others. There is one caveat, though: You cannot search for anything in the images that others share with you, at least from what we can gather. Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users. Google has been working to fix that by directly opening up the ability to search for photos from albums shared with you on Google Photos.

Xiaomi has experimented with lens modules that attach to your phone , realme has experimented with attaching a camera lens to the phone sensor , and vivo went mainstream with the X200 Ultra’s external lens .

Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance .

Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",
