It even spawned a wave of similarly successful hits like REPO and Lethal Company , playing its part in birthing the questionably-named friendslop genre (it's a co-op horror game, really). It's safe to say that this success came as a surprise to the at-the-time solo developer Daniel Knight. Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .

However, while DF's patch notes often skew towards absurdist comedy, update 53.09 features a bugfix that's raw tragedy: \"Mothers no longer seek ghostly babies.\" Sorry, baby shoes. We found a sadder six-word story. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) For the uninitiated, properly attending to your settlement's dead is one of the many obligations the Dwarf Fortress player has to manage. When a dwarf succumbs to one of DF's countless hazards, you don't just suffer the loss of a worker and the emotional toll that's dealt to their grieving loved ones. If a dead dwarf isn't adequately entombed or memorialized, there's a chance that their restless spirit will return to haunt the fortress, further tormenting those who've outlasted them.

While it'd be hard to think of a Fallout game without VATS underlying it, linking gunplay to the classic RPG elements of its predecessors, Fallout 3—the first Fallout game after Bethesda acquired the licence—almost threw the gunplay out with the… uh, gunwater. I've lost track of this metaphor. That's per an interview in the latest issue of Edge (thanks, Gamesradar ). Speaking to lead artist Istvan Pely, it was revealed that \"there were some significant challenges figuring out VATS. There was a long period where it was like, 'Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?'\" To hear Pely describe it, it was a right pain in the butt to get it all sorted—even camera positioning was a big challenge: \"We spent so much time basically trying to get the game to figure out where to put the camera so you could see the slow-motion playback.

Below are the best cards to go for at each budget limit (i.e. $200, $300, and so on). The full list Sparkle Arc B570 - $200 @ Amazon Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5060 - $260 @ Best Buy XFX Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB - $390 @ Newegg PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB - $430 @ Best Buy Sapphire Radeon RX 9070 - $580 @ Newegg ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT - $660 @ Newegg PNY GeForce RTX 5070 Ti - $750 @ Best Buy Up to $200 Intel's Arc B570 isn't the greatest graphics card around but a cent shy of $200, you'd have to step into the second market to find something better.

In Dogpile, it's the point when two dogs of the same type touch and, with a chirpy little bark, merge into one bigger, higher value dog. And if that new dog should happen to pop into existence already next to another dog of the same type, and start off a chain reaction of merges that jostles the whole pile around into an avalanche of yaps… oh boy, that's doggy heaven. Dogpile wisely doesn't overcomplicate that core joy. The format is simple. Each hand, you draw three dogs from your deck, and choose where to drop them into the pit. (Image credit: Studio Folly, Toot Games, Foot) Earn enough bones (generated by merges) within five hands, and you'll earn some upgrades for your dogs. Draw the shop card, and you can use money (also generated by merges) to buy new dogs and tags which grant crucial bonu…",

But here we are, CES in January 2026, and Intel's new Panther Lake chip isn't just the most exciting launch. It's virtually the only launch. Nvidia is obviously utterly consumed by all things AI, plus maybe a touch of memory crisis management. So, there were no new GPUs from Team Green . And AMD had nothing but respins of existing products . I suppose you could point to Qualcomm's second-gen Snapdragon X2 chips as something exciting. But the whole Arm-on-PC thing still has so much to prove, the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been vetted yet. Which leaves Intel and Panther Lake. Being pretty much the only genuinely new PC chip at CES means you could get the impression it wins the excitement prize simply by default. It comes first in a race of one, in other words. Strictly, that's true. But Panther Lake is also genuinely exciting for several reasons. For PC gaming, it's the new Arc B390 iGPU that's most compelling. Intel is claiming up to 70% more performance than its previous-gen Lunar Lake iGPU. And Luna…",

In a post to the official Minecraft news blog , it was revealed that baby mobs will be getting an entirely new appearance. Prior to this drop, all baby mobs were just downsized versions of the fully grown model, with massive heads. Now though, this new look gives them single pixelated eyes and, depending on the mob, an entirely new model, like the little yellow blocky chick rather than a small chicken. According to game director Agnes Larsson, Minecraft's artists have given each mob \"unique textures and models that give each baby mob their own adorable look and identity.\" This applies to all passive mobs which you can breed in the overworld too, like ocelots, all 11 kitten versions, rabbits, all your standard farm animals, and wolf pups.

While there's a brief tutorial for the early access survival game, you're largely on your own when it comes to figuring out anything but the basics. So if you're looking for the Stator blueprint , an important early production item, you might be wondering where you even begin to search. Thankfully, the Stator blueprint isn't all that far from your starting point—in fact, you've probably spotted the location the moment you stepped out of the landing pod—though you will have to do some running and bug-killing to find it. Make sure you've at least crafted a pistol and some ammo before you head out, but you won't need more than that.

Look almost directly north and you'll see a ruined structure in the distance on a ridge . It's hard to see, but it's there—if it helps, orient yourself by looking at the huge metal turbine that dominates the landscape, then swing your view left until you see the structure.

As noticed by Rock, Paper, Shotgun , PEGI has posted a rating for a game called Life is Strange: Reunion, and even given us an outline of what it's all about. The title itself is also a pretty clear hint as to what's coming. \"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret,\" the PEGI rating page says. \"Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.\" There's also at least one spoiler in the rating, and avert your eyes now if you don't want to know: At one point during a party scene, the player is offered the option to drink some wine. But the drink is spiked, and you end up \"tripping balls\" on magic mushrooms—so if you don't want that to happen, just say no. (Really, you shouldn't be accepting open drinks from strangers under any circumstances. That's just a basic survival technique these days.) Life is Strange: Reunion will also feature \"depictions …",

This involves putting together ridiculously overkill builds to squeeze out as much damage as possible for the fun of it. But a group of players found out this week that there is such a thing as too much damage in Path of Exile 2. At a certain point, the game can't calculate the numbers anymore and, instead of pulling a Diablo 4 and going negative , the damage just stops. The boss health bar doesn't budge like some kind of punishment for pushing it further than the developers intended. YouTuber Swedge , and a few other players, discovered that PoE 2 shares the same damage cap as Path of Exile 1 by lighting bosses on fire for obscene amounts of damage. They put together builds that complement each other by multiplying the damage output to the highest degree. But the result was far from satisfying. If you manage to hit a boss for over 35.79 million damage per second, the game refuses to calculate it anymore. But unlike PoE 1, PoE 2 doesn't let the damage roll just under the cap, it turns it off completely. The …",

Blow sat down with me to chat about the game before its reveal and, what with him being so inextricably associated with puzzle games as a genre, I asked what he thought of the state of the genre in the modern era. Does he think it's in a good place? Does it seem particularly interesting or innovative to him as a space? \"No, I don't think it is,\" said Blow. \"And I'm not sure why, because I do feel like there are quite a few really good games in the past that people could look at, if they're sitting down and making a puzzle game… there's enough games that have done really interesting things that you should be able to look at them and, really, go from there, but I don't feel like people do.\" The way Blow sees it, too many puzzle games focus on pure difficulty at the expense of tying their puzzles into something broader—some kind of overarching theme…",

And yet, a Micron-made SSD survives in 2026. The company has just announced the Micron 3610 NVMe SSD , which it bills as \"the industry’s first PCIe Gen5 QLC client SSD, powered by Micron G9 NAND.\" This release suggests that not only is Micron keeping at least a toe in the consumer market despite what was implied mere weeks ago , but that the company may even help pave the way back to reasonable storage pricing. Historically, QLC isn't what you want anywhere near your SSD, due to its high bits per cell leading to sluggish performance and questionable reliability. But times are changing; last year, SK Hynix introduced 321-layer QLC flash memory chips that boasted 100% faster transfer speeds and up to 56% greater write performance than earlier QLC memory. Long story short, the greater NAND density afforded by QLC tech packing in the layers should eventually mean c…",
