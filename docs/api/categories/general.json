The company attributed this delay to an increase in RAM pricing and as well as a temporary shortage. Affected customers can choose the Odin 3 Max instead and get a refund for the price difference. We’ve seen a major spike in RAM prices in recent weeks, and it’s expected that these price hikes could result in Android phones with less RAM than before. Now, a prominent Android handheld brand has announced that this saga is affecting their own new product. AYN has announced on IndieGogo and Discord that shipments of the Odin 3 Ultra model, which features 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, have been delayed to mid-January 2026. The company cited the “skyrocketing” price of RAM and a temporary memory shortage.",

Accidental touches have been a long-standing frustration for Pixel owners, but it now appears that Google is preparing to address the issue in a future update. As first reported by PiunikaWeb , a Google engineer recently marked a related issue as “fixed” on Google’s public issue tracker. In a short comment dated November 29, the engineer said the problem has been resolved and advised users to “watch out for future releases,” which strongly suggests the fix is on its way.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile has added cash payments to its T-Life app, closing a loophole that let in-store customers avoid using it. The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

While AYN’s take on the 3DS is undoubtedly a great device, the 3DS came out when I was a broke college student, so it doesn’t trigger the same level of nostalgia. It also starts at $300, which is expensive for a still-broke working adult with two children.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nx5OLMak2s The more we hear about the upcoming Galaxy S26 series, the more underwhelming this launch feels. For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops. I’m still not sure how many of them I would trust as laptop replacements, but I’ve found that they fill so many more niches than they used to.

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit. If a projector can make me rethink furniture arrangements, budget priorities, and the long-term viability of my current HDMI cable drawer, it’s worth talking about.",
