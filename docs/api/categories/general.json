    "body": "It's hard not to make driving supercars through city streets or rugged off-road jeeps down muddy mountains fun, so it's basically a given that every Forza Horizon game will at least be a good time. But, reaching an ugly peak in Forza Horizon 5, there's been a frustrating trend to carve away at that feeling of career progression in favour of more freedom. You could immediately take part in almost any event and get a supercar in minutes in FH5. In fact, you could easily have a whole garage of supercars in no time—for free—thanks to the Wheelspin system. Not exactly what I'd call a career mode, and it quickly diminished any satisfaction from performing well to earn money and save up for your first fancy ride. This leads me to the one line from Xbox's recent Developer Direct , which finally opened the hood on Forza Horizon 6 , that instantly brought me on board: Torben Ellert, design director of FH6, said, \"You'll start out as just a tourist in Japan.\" Ellert explains that \"your first goal is to join the Horizon Festival by completing the Horizon qualifiers. After that, you'll rise through the ranks, unlocking wristbands as you complete races in faster, more exciting cars.\" In other w…",

I use 'look' in its broadest possible terms, though, because what Rootkid has created isn't a special set of goggles or the like. It's essentially a radio wave transceiver, named Spectrum Slit , that converts the flurry of signals around us into light, emitted by a construction that gives all kinds of Control vibes, for some reason. \"Spectrum Slit is a sculptural installation that renders visible the otherwise imperceptible electromagnetic activity that permeates contemporary interior spaces,\" begins Rootkid. \"While a room may appear visually calm and silent, it is continuously traversed by dense fields of radio-frequency transmissions generated by wireless communication technologies.\" Rootkid describes the full process behind the design, construction, and operation of Spectrum Slit in a seven-minute …",

Well, at least that's how it was in Fable (the old one), but things are changing for Fable (the new one). Speaking to IGN about the upcoming reboot, Playground's founder and general manager Ralph Fulton explained the studio's decision to drop alignment entirely in favour of a reputation system: \"Our morality system is more about shades of gray. It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion I think is really clear these days.\" I would argue that the idea there's no objective evil in the world is maybe a bit much—there's plenty of ways we're all horrible to each other that aren't really up for interpretation.

I purchased the Peerless Assassin 120 SE V2, a version of the cooler with six heatpipes, for £26. It's currently $33 on Amazon US . Thermalright has around 40,000 variants of any one cooler, all with names using a combination of around ten words, and spanning nine pages on its website . I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging. It's much larger than the other budget options I've reviewed recently, including the Arctic Freezer 36 and Cooler Master Hyper 212 Pro . It's a dual-tower cooler, one…",

If you're wondering why that's a big deal, it's not to most gamers . If you have a Windows 11 PC with relatively new hardware, you should be able to enable all with little problem. However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust. However, one of the biggest complaints levied at Secure Boot is on behalf of Linux gamers. While Linux does have something called Secure Boot, that's not w…",

In their latest video, Der8auer claims that the OPP is \"basically like a cashback thing where Nvidia tried to actively influence the AIBs and the pricing to make sure that some cards happen on the market and that they are actually being sold by the AIBs for the MSRP.\" Without that incentive scheme in place, Der8auer argues, \"You will have to expect massive price increases across all of these cards. So that means that MSRP that Nvidia communicated in the past basically no longer exists\" Der8auer says they don't know what the OPP actually stands for, but Hardware Luxx argues it to be 'Open Price Program' . This is not the only way that AIBs are reportedly encouraged to put out MSRP cards.

Basically, if something's bothering you—like, say, the recent transmog updates—it's not going to stay that way for long. In case you're unfamiliar, WoW's recently rehashed its transmog (a glamour/outfit system) to work on specific outfits you buy slots for with in-game gold. This has the upshot of not requiring you to visit a transmog specialist every time you get a new piece of gear, while reducing flexibility—due, in part, to the gold cost. Given you'll be saving money on not doing repeat visits to your favourite ethereal, Blizzard reasoned that this new way of doing things ought to be more expensive.

The new game is in the hands of Forza Horizon studio Playground Games, which has very little in common with the old Lionhead except for—perhaps crucially—its Britishness. In an interview published by Xbox, Fable game director Ralph Fulton discussed how the studio dealt with taking on a storied series from a once-venerated studio. \"One of the things I said to the team was, ‘Look, we’re not Lionhead—we can’t try to make a Lionhead game.’ This has to be a Playground game because I’m a really firm believer that the personality and the character of a team is visible in the work they do and the games they make.\" Fulton went on: \"And I think you can see Lionhead in that original trilogy. It would be pointless, I think, for us to try and ape that. And that’s really at the heart of the reboot question, right? It felt imperative to me that this was a reboot because we’re starting again as Playground Games, and making Playground’s Fable.\" One sacrosanct part of the Fab…",

Ask certain incredibly cool members of the PC Gamer team and they might even tell you it's actually higher than that. But it's also not a super difficult game—it's fairly easy to assemble a party that can make mincemeat of any foe they happen across. Would it have done better if, instead of its more general backer beta that focused on player response to the game as a whole, it had adopted a Baldur's Gate 3-style early access period, where an early portion of the game was released and used to aggressively fine-tune balance in particular? Its director, Josh Sawyer, doesn't think so. \"I still think we would have had the same issues,\" said Sawyer in response to a question from a fan. \"A lot of the issues were evident because they got magnified over the course of the game—the later you get in the game, the more the balance gets out of wack, just because there are more numbers inputting into the system.\" After all, BG3's balance wasn't perfect. \"This is not a slam against BG3, but just sort of recognition: at launch, a lot of people really did not speak fondly of how the third act of …",

    "body": "I had my eye on Pulsar mice for quite a while before getting my hands on the X2 CrazyLight, as they seemed to be aimed at those with competitive FPS gaming sensibilities like my own. After spending a lot of time with this particular mouse, I can confirm this is certainly the market for these mice. But despite me thoroughly enjoying using the Pulsar X2 CrazyLight, it probably won't be the best option out there for many competitive FPS gamers. If you aren't familiar with the company's line-up of gaming mice, looking at Pulsar's product pages can be very confusing. Even just looking at the X2 series , there are a whole bunch of different models there. There are 'A' versions which are ambidextrous, 'H' versions which have a bigger 'hump' to them, and so on, plus different size variations. It's the medium-sized X2 CrazyLight that I've been spending time with, although I have also tried the CrazyLight X2H in mini sizing. Apart from being a little too small for my hand, I also found the hump in the latter too pronounced for my liking and a little distracting, so I've stuck to considering the regular one for this review.

Lucy finally got to the Vault-Tec facility where her dad's cooking up something terrible, more Coop flashbacks, and we finally got a Super Mutant cameo. What's better, he's voiced by none other than Ron Perlman. It's a pretty short scene, the Super Mutant actually rescues the Ghoul from a nasty fate after getting punched out of a window and impaled on a pole, and then drags him to an unknown location, supposedly where other Super Mutants are living. The mutant then asks the Ghoul to join his cause of going after the Enclave. After Coop refuses, he gets knocked out and dragged away from the hideout. (Image credit: Prime Video) That's all the time I needed. I had thought we'd see a Super Mutant at some point in the show, especially after FEV was properly mentioned in the last episode, but I didn't expect they'd get Perlman to voice it. For those unfamiliar with Perlman's previous Fallout work, he voiced the iconic line \"war never changes\" in almost every Fallout game and voiced Butch Harries in Fallout 4—despite his first role in the series paying just $40 and a sandwich .

And not for terrible reasons: Weird pre-order bonuses that reek of the worst of videogame DLC , the slow-motion trainwreck that was Sigil , the troubles with getting anything BG3-related off the ground (and also laying off most of the folks who made BG3 responsible). I am delighted to report, however, that D&D Beyond is doing something unequivocally neat in its partnered content program, and looks set to continue doing neat things with it without screwing up. In case you're unfamiliar, D&D Beyond is a digital tabletop version of the TTRPG that Wizards of the Coast bought in 2022. The content partner program, which has been in effect since 2024, allows folks to integrate their work into D&D Beyond while being compensated for their craft. While my little independent-loving heart thinks sweeping everything into one WoTC-owned platform probably isn't healthy for the hobby as a whole, this kind of cooperation is still a major improvement over… well, the entire OGL thing .

Meanwhile, I'm over here trying to figure out how something like this is even possible in the first place. Taking a gander over at the official Arknights: Endfield Discord server and it seems like the issue was noted fairly early on into the game's launch as one member posted: \"im getting other peoples accounts for paypal???\" before warning other people to disconnect their PayPal payment from the game entirely just 20 minutes later. 1.3k Euro from r/Endfield Screenshots began to crop up of PayPal statements showing multiple charges from Hypergryph in multiple different currencies. \"All I purchased was the monthly pass for 7.34 CAD yet was charged 108 CAD in a different currency after,\" another user…",

No, literally. \"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years,\" Ingold writes on Bluesky . \"I admit I'm surprised! Made in nine months, mostly as an experiment to learn Godot, and an excuse to play with some actors. (And for me to do some acting.)\" TR-49 is a puzzle game where you have to feed books to an old computer to discover a world-changing secret. Ingold was a mathematical consultant on The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing inventing the first computer to break the Enigma code in World War 2, so this seems right up his alley. The reveal that TR-49 was made in just nine months is very impressive on its own. The fact that it's also the best launch Inkle has ever had makes it even more so. It reminds me of the recent success of Peak, the co-op climber Aggro Crab rustled up in a frantic four-week game jam , refining it in a few short months afterwards alongside Landfall.

When they all first launched, eight to 12 months ago, it was a depressing task because stocks were incredibly low for almost every model, forcing prices to go sky-high across the board. Eventually, towards the tail end of 2025, the situation resolved, and you could pick up all kinds of GPUs for considerably less than their MSRPs. Now, thanks to the global memory supply crisis, graphics cards sporting 16 GB or more of VRAM are all shooting back up in price. In November of last year, you could bag yourself a 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti , RTX 5070 Ti , or RTX 5080 for $400, $745, or $990, respectively. Today, those same graphics cards are, at best, $450, $829, and $1,268. That might not seem particularly bad, especially in light of just how expensive they were at launch, but those prices are the very best around. For example, B&H's cheapest 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti is $630 , and should you want an RTX 5070 Ti from Best Buy , you'll need to hand over $1,199. This isn't to say that graphics cards with less than 16 GB of VRAM haven't been unaffected, as they have all increased in price, too. It's…",
