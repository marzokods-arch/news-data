I don’t think so!” remarked the singer-songwriter to the 8,000 attendees who packed the Auditorio GNP Seguros on Thursday (Sept. 4) during the second night of the tour, according to figures from OCESA. “There’s something here,” the musician noted. Sanz’s new trek marks his return to the Latin American country after two years.

Each piece of equipment was designed for rapid loading and unloading from tightly packed semitrucks, sometimes multiple times per day, and to perform flawlessly during the show. The fast pace means that some shows must be created without a pre-rig — typically set up in advance by a smaller crew to install essential rigging like motors and trusses — meaning the entire show must be assembled and struck within a single day.&nbsp; That’s a daunting task which requires “us to bring on the smartest guys we know in touring — SGPS ShowRig,&#8221;&nbsp;says TSO tour director Elliot Saltzman , who has worked with the Las Vegas-based company since 2006. “They became part of the team, not just a vendor.&#8221;&nbsp; Related &#8216;Taste of SoFi Stadium&#8217; Offers Preview of Venue&#8217;s Latest Bites for Football Fans, Concertgoers &amp;&nbsp;Beyond Miranda Lamber…",
