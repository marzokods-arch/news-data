    "body": "A 10-foot statue of rock n’ roll queen Tina Turner was unveiled Saturday (Sept. 27) in the rural Tennessee community where she grew up — before becoming a Grammy-winning singer, an electrifying stage performer, and one the world’s most recognizable and popular entertainers. The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands. The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the “mane of a lion.” Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs “Nutbush City Limits,” “Proud Mary,” “Private Dancer,” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” from the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.”…",

This marks the first concert at Sanford Stadium in more than a decade.

For newer fans, that legacy might come as a surprise. Beginning with FTISLAND in 2007, followed by CNBLUE and N.Flying , FNC Entertainment has long explored the intersection of rock and K-pop. More than a decade later, the label is introducing a new band: AxMxP (pronounced A-M-P) , a four-member unit consisting of vocalist/rapper HA YOO JOON, guitarist/vocalist KIM SHIN, drummer CRU, and bassist/vocalist JU HWAN. Their name stands for Amplify Music Power , symbolizing a mission to broadcast their voices through music like an amplifier. Officially debuting on Sept. 10, AxMxP embodies the essence of a true rookie, arriving with a full-length self-titled album spanning 10 tracks that traverse punk rock, rock ballad, modern pop-rock and hip-hop rock.
