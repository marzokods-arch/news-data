With December now upon us, 2026 is right around the corner, and the new year is set to bring us all manner of new product launches. One of the first we’ll be looking forward to is Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series, but we’ve got more than just phones on our radar, as we’re also anticipating Samsung’s next generation of Galaxy Buds earbuds. We’ve already taken an early look at the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro design , as well as previewed some animations showing off new Buds 4 functionality .

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps.

Buoyed by burgeoning industrial and agricultural sectors, the city’s population rose by 1.7 million people over the past four decades as its footprint on the West African landscape expanded several times over . Amid bustling new networks of roads, residential neighborhoods, markets, and workshops, lie signs of a much earlier era, when the city was the seat of a powerful pre-colonial kingdom. Remnants of ancient earthworks, thought to be among the longest in the world, can even be seen in images of the city captured from space. Benin Iya (sometimes called the Benin Earthworks, the Walls of Benin, and the Benin Moat) is a vast, cellular network of interlocking earthen walls, ramparts, and ditches that radiate outward from a central moat at the heart of the city. Built in sections over hundreds of years between the 7th and 14th centuries, the system was key to marking defensive, political, and economic boundaries and played an important role in maintaining order and stabili…",

While most Android purists might disagree, I’m glad that one of my favorite Android brands , OnePlus, is implementing some iOS-inspired features.

    "body": "Credit: Jonathan Feist / Android Authority There’s never a shortage of cleaning to do once the holidays roll around, as people visit and pine needles appear out of thin air. Black Friday has at least made one part easier this year, with iRobot cutting prices on three of its latest models at Amazon. The Roomba deals cover everything from a flagship auto-empty system to an entry-level LiDAR bot, so there’s something for most budgets. The Roomba Max 705 Vac is the priciest of the bunch. Still, at $549 in the sale, it’s a massive $350 off, and it brings the full feature stack: extreme suction, anti-tangle rubber brushes, ClearView LiDAR mapping, and object recognition smart enough to dodge socks, cords, and even pet waste. The AutoEmpty Dock can trap weeks’ worth of debris in a sealed bag, and the robot can switch suction levels automatically for carpets and high-traffic spots.",

    "body": "EO Science Earth Observatory Rings of Rock in the Sahara Earth Earth Observatory Image of the Day More Subscribe September 13, 2025 In northeastern Africa, within the driest part of the Sahara, dark rocky outcrops rise above pale desert sands. Several of these formations, including Jabal Arakanū, display striking ring-shaped structures. Jabal Arkanū (also spelled Arkenu) lies in southeastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. Several other massifs are clustered nearby, including Jabal Al Awaynat (or Uweinat), located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast. Roughly 90 kilometers to the west are the similarly named Arkenu structures . These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock. Repeated intrusion events produced a series of overlapping rings, their centers roughly aligned toward the southwest. The resulting ring complex—composed of igneous basalt and granite—is bordered to the north by a hat-sha…",

    "body": "EO Science Earth Observatory Cranberry Country, Wisconsin Earth Earth Observatory Image of the Day More Subscribe October 13, 2025 Known as America’s Dairyland, Wisconsin produces the most cheese of any state and trails only California in the production of milk. Less famously, the state outpaces all others in a key part of many Thanksgiving menus. Wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries in the U.S., with its annual hauls accounting for more than half of the country’s total yield. The wetlands, cool climate, and sandy, acidic soils of central and northern Wisconsin provide the foundation for raising the tart berry successfully. This satellite image shows geometric networks of cranberry beds alongside small lakes near the town of Warrens, the “Cranberry Capital of Wisconsin.” It was acquired with the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 on October 13, 2025, during the autumn harvest season. When berries are ripe, growers flood fields with up to a foot of water and then use specialized machines to knock fruit off the vines. Because cranberries contain pockets of air, they float to the surface—turning entire fields red—to be corralled and removed . Beds are not all …",
