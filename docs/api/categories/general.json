    "body": "Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean are reuniting for a co-headlining concert at the University of Georgia’s Sanford Stadium. On Saturday (Sept. 27), the Georgia-born country stars and longtime friends announced they’ll take the stage together at the approximately 93,000-capacity venue in Athens on April 25, 2026. This marks the first concert at Sanford Stadium in more than a decade. The last time the venue hosted live music was in 2013, when Aldean headlined his Night Train Tour (with Bryan as the opening act at the show), making them the first artists ever to perform a concert at the stadium. The upcoming UGA concert will also feature performances from country acts Zach Top and Lauren Alaina , along with appearances by DJ Rock and Dee Jay Silver. Pre-sale tickets for Aldean and Bryan’s fan club members will be available starting Monday (Sept. 29). General ticket sales begin Oct. 3.

    "body": "Laufey opened a two-night stand at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles on Friday (Sept. 26) with a show that captured her unique place in pop — her music is rooted in jazz, but her concert has pop-superstar production values.

It will conclude in Kópavogur, Iceland, on March 15, 2026. Laufey (it’s pronounced LAY-vay, for those still catching up to her) won a Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album in 2024 for her sophomore album, Bewitched , and she could be headed for another win in that category on Feb. 1 for her third album, A Matter of Time . The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 4. It has topped Billboard ’s Jazz Albums chart for the past four weeks. ( Bewitched logged 102 weeks at No. 1 on that chart.)

Their name stands for Amplify Music Power , symbolizing a mission to broadcast their voices through music like an amplifier. Officially debuting on Sept. 10, AxMxP embodies the essence of a true rookie, arriving with a full-length self-titled album spanning 10 tracks that traverse punk rock, rock ballad, modern pop-rock and hip-hop rock.
