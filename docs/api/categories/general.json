It's not busy compared to years prior, sure, but I'm thankful for the free time when I look ahead at the schedule for March. We really need a monthly limit on MMO and RPG releases or something—emphasis on the limit if you're combining the two. But until then there's more than enough to hold you over, including the brutally honest survival game Unemployment Simulator 2018 , and Edmund McMillen's turn-based adventures about selectively screwed up cats, Mewgenics. He thinks it's his best game yet, and Tyler may agree with him . As for myself, I'm kind of in a weird, creepy, cozy marathon until next month rolls in. I've been enjoying the adorably spooky lo-fi puzzles in Creature Kitchen's demo , and riding a man-eating elevator to hell in the co-op nightmare that is Kletka. It's out in 1.0 later this month, so I'm trying to break out of this mouthy contraption now before it adds any more Russian creepypastas to the menu.

Rose in picture, rose in name of game. Who could fault this theory? Alas, as cool as a remake of Rule of Rose would be, that's not what the teaser is teasing. Bloober Team CEO has confirmed as much on LinkedIn . \"Nice guess, but no,\" Piotr Babieno posted in response to an article by Twisted Voxel. \"It definitely doesn't refer to any remake.\" The teaser appeared at the URL remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com . In addition to the suspicious rose there's also the text \"some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait\", as well as a counter counting down to 11 days from now: on February 15.

Just don't grab the Divinity: Original Sin 2: Eternal Edition pack, also on Steam. For some reason, that's only been marked down 60%, or $10 more for only five of the series' six games⁠—the furtive Dragon Commander, so easily forgotten… 23 bucks feels like a steal for Original Sin 2 alone. Our 2017 game of the year remains a fresh, surprising RPG almost a full decade after launch. And don't believe the haters : Its magic/physical armor system is actually brilliant , and it's an incalculable loss for all mankind that Larian will not be revisiting it in the upcoming Divinity. That's just \"Divinity\" coming soon, nothing Divine, Beyond, 2, Dragon Commander, Original Sin, or Original Sin 2 about it.

Maybe not! Bruce Nesmith, lead designer on Skyrim, doesn't think so, anyway. In an interview with PressboxPR , Nesmith, who left Bethesda in 2021 during the development of Starfield, laid out the reasons it wouldn't make sense for Bethesda to try to duplicate what it's done with the Fallout show. \"What you have to realize about things like the Fallout TV show is that they don't make Bethesda money directly,\" Nesmith said. \"I would be shocked if Bethesda is making any money that they care about really, not when you make literally billions of dollars on Skyrim.

According to an FAQ , Adobe Animate will no longer be available to purchase (it's actually a monthly subscription) starting March 1. After that, existing enterprise customers will be able to access the software and receive technical support until March 1, 2029, while customers with individual licenses only have until March 1, 2027 to keep using Adobe Animate. It may not be as popular as it was in the heyday of Newgrounds , but Adobe Animate is still used to make new shows, such as Star Trek: Lower Decks, as well as videogames. The animations for Mewgenics , the latest game from important Flash game designers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, were made in Adobe Animate.

I'd highly recommend you play them, or at least, play a little bit of them: they're pretty hard going by modern standards. Now's a better time than ever to become acquainted with this slice of PC gaming history: GOG is giving away the original Alone in the Dark trilogy right now. It's actually more than the original trilogy too, because it includes Jack in the Dark, a weird spin-off released between Alone in the Dark and its sequel about a kid stuck in a creepy toy store. While Alone in the Dark has many of the hallmarks of early survival horror, including tank controls, fixed camera perspectives, and near-unmanagable combat, newcomers may be surprised how much it borrows from point 'n' click adventures.

I imagine we'll probably get at least one of those remasters in the future: the same leak that was right about the Oblivion remaster also said a Fallout 3 remaster was in the works. So I guess the real question is: when? Naturally, fans are hoping it'll be sooner and not later—many even hope a remaster will be announced alongside the Fallout Season 2 finale this week—and Bethesda is doing its part to keep that hopium flowing. A new ad promoting Bethesda's Fallout games was posted today, and some fans claim it not-so-subtly suggests that a Fallout 3 remaster announcement is imminent. That's because the ad shows Aaron Moten, who plays Maximus on the Fallout TV series, inside Fallout 3. Hmm… In the ad, Moten is roommates with a giant Vault Boy mascot.

With another trackpad on the left-hand side in place of the d-pad, you're dual-wielding... and stuck with a high learning curve and a pretty ugly look. However, some have sworn it's the way to go, once you're used to it, and I've had what I can only describe as a morbid curiosity ever since. It's fair to say that we at PC Gamer have never been the biggest fans of the Steam Controller, either. We got the chance to try it at GDC in 2014 , where we said, \"I would've absolutely had more fun and been more effective with an Xbox 360 controller.\" We then got to test it for its official launch the following year and were, again, not that impressed . We also weren't that into the idea of a second one back in 2022, though we did admit the Steam Deck owes its great controls to the controller. In fairness, with Valve eventually selling the controller for just $5 by the end of its life , it seems like the general controller-wielding masses weren't massively moved by it…",

Like all good ideas, it seems, Bell says the Shield project came from an enthusiastic group of engineers: \"Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,\" Bell opines. \"To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make... but in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.\" Through a series of acquisitions and partnerships, (including the purchase of PortalPlayer in 2007, which led to the Tegra Arm chips at their hearts), Nvidia gradually gathered the elements that would make up its early Shield iterations .

Well, far from resting on their laurels, the team has since taken their efforts one step further (via Videocardz ). Thanks to the addition of an Asus GeForce RTX 2080 Ti PCB as its base and some clever power tweaking, the GPU-with-a-hole has managed to set a world record: the top spot in Unigine Superposition's online rankings for an RTX 5070 Ti, running the 8K optimized preset. Over the course of a seven-hour+ live stream , the team fought against a litany of issues to convince the Frank-o-card to perform properly, including an early problem with low-resolution-only output and voltage drops under load. A rat's nest of wires, the judicious use of yellow tape, and the odd cutting tool were used to reduce conductor resistance and voltage loss between the two cards—although it still seems to have the odd quirk worth looking into.

    "body": "How does that song by the Welsh rock back Stereophonics go, again? It only takes one tree to make a thousand matches; it only takes one match to burn a thousand trees. Lest I murder this shoehorned comparison any more than necessary, it seems as though Pluma_1980's bid to drag GTA 5 into the modern era requires just one hobbyist modder and 20,000 trees. Named GTA5 V4EVER , Pluma's project strives to \"update the atmosphere of the entire map\" by stuffing Los Santos with more environmental detail than any game from 2013 probably deserves. Far from a simple reshade or texture swap, this pretty massive undertaking adds 20,000 new world objects—from trees to plants, shrubs, fences, poles, signs, street clutter, roadside scenery and more. Moreover, outdated props such as phone booths have been whipped out entirely; while neighbourhoods have been given a fresh lick of paint or a new coat of grime depending on their economic standing—with Pluma's end game being to craft a world that feels \"alive and renewed, without losing the original spirit.\" The outcome is indeed a re-densified Los Santos and Blaine County, whose main thoroughfares feel refreshed and its peripheries reinvigorated.

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein, or an account associated with his email address, was banned from Xbox Live in 2013, new documents released by the US Justice Department reveal. The ban notice cites \"harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players,\" but it appears that the actual reason was that Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, was already a registered sex offender at that point. A 2013 email to Jeffrey Epstein's account notifying him that his Xbox Live account has been banned. (Image credit: DOJ files) In 2012, Xbox and other gaming companies began working with New York State to ban registered sex offenders from their platforms. Sony, EA, Warner Bros, Disney, Blizzard, and Apple were also part of the agreement, according to a 2012 New York Times article . After the ban notice, Epstein also received a notice explaining the cause. \"This message is to notify you that Xbox LIVE has permanently suspended the Xbox LIVE account associated with this email address,\" reads the second email. \"This action is based on the New York Attorney General's partnership with Microsoft and other online gaming companies to remove New York registered sex offenders from online gaming …",

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Grand Theft Auto has always thrived on an outsider’s perspective. There’s something sardonically Scottish about its trademark tone—the relentless skewering of American excess and absurdity, paired with a loving recreation of the country’s most iconic cities. You can feel the awe of a tourist in the way your field-of-view shifts as you stare up at the skyscrapers of Liberty City—a technical trick that induces a kind of grounded vertigo. Yet Rockstar had never so explicitly embraced the outsider before GTA 4. Niko Bellic is quite literally fresh off the boat, propelled by his cousin’s fanciful promises of riches, as well as the horror of the Balkan wars behind him. \"I had been living in New York for a few years,\" Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser told the Lex Fridman podcast two months ago. \"I was single and miserable, and I…",
