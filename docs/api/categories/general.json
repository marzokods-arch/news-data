While Lennox made Sinister Grift largely on his own — with co-production courtesy of his Animal Collective bandmate Josh Dibb, also known as Deakin — he recruited four additional collaborators&nbsp;to bring his songs to life onstage, the first time he had ever done so for a tour of his solo material.&nbsp; Panda Bear shared the road with Toro y Moi on the first leg of the tour and notably paid a visit to NPR’s Tiny Desk in April. Alongside bassist Tim Koh, keyboardist and vocalist Maria Reis, drummer Tomé Silva and Spirit of the Beehive singer Rivka Ravede on the sampler, Lennox, wielding an electric guitar, alternately floated and ripped through three tracks during the unfiltered NPR performance. The 15-minute set showcased the strength of his eternally youthful voice, and the remarkable cohesion among the players, who had been together for less than a year. “I thought about doing a band thing, kind of off and on for a long time,” says Lennox. “I wanted people in the city or close by so we could really j…",

And while on that topic, what other colors will be available on the OnePlus 15? A new leak may have shed some light on those questions. The leak about the “SuperBlack” color came from trusted tipster Digital Chat Station, who is back with another color-related leak. This time, the Weibo user has revealed what could be the official color names for the OnePlus 15. Additionally, they shared how much each SKU could weigh.",

Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles. But how does that compare to the new iPhone 17 family?",

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

Today we’re hearing about some ambitious plans to expand its hardware lineup, with a report outlining the company’s goals for two new AR solutions. Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects. Last year, we heard that Amazon could be building an AR pair of its own , though one that would be focused on assisting its delivery drivers.

With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes.

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus 15 camera leaks reveal a new focal length and aperture for the 50MP periscope telephoto lens. The new lens supposedly has a narrower f/2.8 aperture, a downgrade from the OnePlus 13’s f/2.6 aperture. Another possible leak suggests the OnePlus 15 might be cheaper due to cost-cutting measures, including a different display and the end of the Hasselblad partnership. OnePlus makes some excellent Android flagships , and the current generation OnePlus 13 checks all the right boxes, so we’re very excited to see what the company has in store for its successor, the OnePlus 15 (Chinese culture regards the number “4” as unlucky). The company recently confirmed that its Hasselblad partnership is over, and that it is building its own DetailMax Engine for photography. Now, more specifications of the OnePlus 15’s camera have leaked, and there’s both good and bad news. Leaker Digital Chat Station has shared that the OnePlus 15 could come with a 50MP periscope telephoto camera. This camera could have an 85mm equivalent focal length and f/2.8 aperture.",

After all, the newest member of the Galaxy S25 series already has it, and others are in line. But, Samsung still appears to be executing some finishing touches right before the stable rollout, and has now released the seventh One UI 8 beta for the Galaxy S25 series. The update weighs in at about 603MB and primarily focuses on fixing issues. As noted by tipster Tarun Vats on X , the beta update is rolling out in Germany. Meanwhile, other replies confirm that it has also been released in the UK, the US, India, and South Korea. The update arrives less than two weeks after the sixth One UI 8 beta for the Galaxy S25 was released.",
