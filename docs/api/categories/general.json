On the plus side, this is a very speedy monitor, even by OLED standards. It tops out at 480 Hz refresh, making it one of the quicker 1440p gaming OLEDs out there. It's also relatively reasonably priced for a model with 480 Hz refresh, typically coming in around $700 or £800. On the other hand, the LG UltraGear 27GX790A doesn't get the latest and brightest LG WOLED panel technology . It's also a bit slim on features, lacking USB-C connectivity or speakers of any kind.

To be fair, it did all seem quite portentous, and in a world where Saudi Arabia bought EA and Microsoft bought Activision, the theories that Ubi had itself been acquired or undergone some kind of enormous financial calamity didn't feel totally out there. But stand down, folks. Ubisoft's delayed financial report took place earlier today, and it turns out all that hullabaloo was—per company big boss Yves Guillemot—for perhaps the most boring reason imaginable: \"We appointed a new panel of auditors, that was approved at the [Annual General Meeting] last July.\" Oh. In essence, Ubi's new numbers guys decided that revenues from one of its partnerships from the fiscal year before this one needed to be recognised in a different way. The long and short of this process is that the new way of recognising those revenues meant the company suddenly overshot a covenant on how much net debt to core profit it's meant to maintain, and it had to quickly fork over 286 million euros to pay off some ou…",

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

World of Warcraft is in a pre-expansion lull at the moment and everyone is hungry for co-op games. Fellowship couldn't have arrived at a better time. And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make. It's not exploding on Steam like Arc Raiders, but it's been quietly hovering around 8,000 concurrent players, which is a pretty healthy amount for something that hasn't been fully released yet. The developer update also has a lengthy interview between Bode and …",

There are plenty of ingredients for you to familiarise yourself with as you explore Wishblossom Ranch and its biomes, but none of them really give you any clues what they'd be used for, and Button Stew is not the most intuitive name. Button Stew is likely to pop up in your horse's favourite meals, especially Khan, so you'll want to check the recipe off your list as soon as possible. Even though it's only a two-star entree, it's not an easy dish to guess the ingredients for, and you have to venture a little out of the mountains if you want to batch cook some. How to make Button Stew in Disney Dreamlight Valley To cook Button Stew, you need to take the follow ingredients to a cooking pot either in Remy's Restaurant or outside of your house in Wishblossom Ranch: 1 x Button Mushroom 1 x Carrot If you're not planning on feeding your stew to your horse (or yourself) then you can sell it at Goofy's stall for 375 Star Coins. Alternatively, eating it gives you a decent buff of +135 stamina. Since it's so easy to make as well, it's a decent way to ear…",

Less risk of hypothermia, though my components are perfectly chilly. The Arctic Xtender case is the star of the show here. The cooling company's first case and I dare say a good one. Confusingly for a company famed for its CPU coolers, it focuses on looks, rather than pure cooling ability. Needless to say, it looks absolutely superb under the heavily-tinted mirrored glass surrounding its fishtank-style exterior. It looks so good, in fact, I'm starting to question why I opted for a white build rather than this dashing, icy look.

Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free. I should note that, in other MMOs, these sorts of limitations are a sign you're playing a trial, not a free-to-play game.
