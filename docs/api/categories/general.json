In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone.

No major universal T-Mobile Tuesdays promos are available this week, just smaller discounts at select restaurants, gas stations, and more. T-Mobile Tuesdays might not be quite as exciting as it used to be, but there are still some pretty cool freebies from time to time. This can include big things like free MLB.TV season passes , or smaller things like discounts at certain restaurants and the like. Occasionally, there will also be physical gifts. While these T-Mobile freebies are often available to both Metro and T-Mobile customers, every once in a while, Metro gets an exclusive offer of its own. That day is today, as first spotted by lilijana1225 via Reddit . The item in question is a set that includes measuring cups and baking spatulas just in time for all your holiday baking needs.

Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, shared an update earlier this month, revealing that 70% of the Pebble 2 Duo units have already been delivered, while the remaining orders are either in transit or scheduled to be shipped in the following days. In addition to this, Migicovsky has also relaunched the Pebble app store for early backers to enjoy new watch faces, apps, or games on their latest watches.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

The OnePlus 15R is expected to be a rebadged version of the Ace 6, which was launched in China last month. OnePlus is also teasing a new smartwatch, which may be a rebadged OPPO Watch. Last week, OnePlus unveiled its latest top-tier phone, the OnePlus 15 , but skipped a crucial element. Over the past few years, the company’s flagships have been accompanied by less premium but more value-for-money flagship killers, denoted by an “R” suffix.

This two-part annual release schedule could predictably cause a reactionary split in Android flagship launches, with more premium models launching in the fall, and budget and value options launching in the coming spring. Ever since the iPhone 4S was launched in 2011, Apple has typically introduced its main phone lineup in September or October. Android smartphone manufacturers previously prioritized a flagship launch at events like MWC. However, over the years, it seemed that the entire industry had been inching closer to releasing the best new Android phones closer to Apple’s latest iPhone. This year, it’s the closest Android flagship SoCs have launched next to Apple’s SoC, and consequently, new Android flagships have arrived closer to the iPhone 17 series . Just as Android OEMs were about to settle into this rhythm, Apple seems to be on its way to run at a different pace. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Now Google is providing a helpful new tool for quickly tracking down where we can watch something. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
