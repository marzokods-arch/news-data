And, in a new twist this time around, rather than the coaches dividing up their teams into pairs for the Battle rounds, this time the singers were the ones choosing their partners, though the coaches retained the power to choose what song they will sing.

Despite the Monday blues wafting through the halls of the arena, the mere sight of him causes a lethargic crowd to erupt into pandemonium. The band’s legion of supporters have shown up in droves to support their masked crusaders, doused in ethereal black cloaks, fishnets, lace, masks, and other Token-esque attire, as if they were wearing their favorite player&#8217;s jersey to an NFL home game. This level of devotion is hardly uncommon for Sleep Token fans, who have spent the better part of five years supporting, deciphering , and succumbing to the anonymous band’s music and shows, which they call “Rituals.” But from the outside, this level of cultish reverence for a rock band in 2025 feels both new and nostalgic, harkening back to the days when such bands ruled the world.

But those artists didn’t reach the summit on their own. Far from it.
