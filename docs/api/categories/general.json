    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is changing how RAW images are handled on the web. When you click edit, you’ll have two options: Edit with Google Photos or download the RAW file. Choosing to edit with Photos will convert the photo into a JPEG. RAW not only allows you to capture the highest quality photos, but the format also gives you greater editing flexibility. However, these benefits come at a cost, and that cost is space. RAW images have an enormous file size compared to JPEGs, and not every photo editor can handle them, including Google Photos. But now Google Photos on the web will give you two options for how to deal with these types of files. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

They put me to work though. There are these bugs called Praying Mantises. They lay eggs and they form pods on the Douglas Fir Christmas trees. It’s their favorite tree to infest,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I would walk around the Christmas trees all day and pick them off and put them in a little basket.&#8221; But her devotion to the holiday goes beyond her Entomological efforts as a child. Following her 2006 self-titled debut, Swift released The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection EP in 2007 that contains six cuts – four covers and two original offerings, &#8220;Christmases When You Were Mine&#8221; and &#8220;Christmas Must Be Something More.&#8221; Since then, she’s written one more explicitly festive song – 2019’s &#8220;Christmas Tree Farm&#8221; – and one that has found its way into the Swiftian zeitgeist as a yuletide track.

In Latin America Christmas is loud, there’s dancing, there’s movement… and in the U.S., it’s all about getting cozy because it’s cold outside. I ended up loving both cultures, so with this version of ‘It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,’ we wanted to bring those two worlds together. Every time I hear it, it takes me back to my family, and I hope it does the same for other people too.” Thalía, on the other hand, released an original flirty tune called “Santa (Tengo Un Crush Contigo),” in both English and Spanish, describing everything she loves about the festive season.&nbsp;“…",

The Index 01 records voice notes on a paired smartphone, and can also do things like set reminders and control music playback. The new ring is available for pre-order today for $75. Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G.

At its thinnest point, the TriFold measures just 3.9mm (0.15 inches), and trying to achieve this has presumably also forced Samsung to cut out excessive features. The additional fold on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has allowed Samsung to increase the battery size on the TriFold while retaining the same camera system.

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront.
