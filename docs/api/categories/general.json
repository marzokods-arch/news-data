    "summary": "The tracks that defined the year, and all of the underrated gems and slow-burn hits found in between.",
    "body": "In the U.K. and Ireland, this year’s most striking and memorable songs reflected a restless, creative pulse: pop shifting into new shapes, rap sharpening its edges, and dance music once again becoming a shared language. Stars such as Olivia Dean and Lola Young lit up airwaves and festival stages across the world, while CMAT, Dave and Sam Fender all stuck gold on their respective third albums, each of which contained their most illuminating material yet. 2024 was challenging for U.K and Ireland artists at home and abroad, with a distinct lack of marquee releases from our biggest acts, plus only a handful of No. 1 singles for homegrown talent (Charli xcx, Chase &amp; Status, Hozier). The past 12 months, however, have seen something of a sea change, with the long-term development of British and Irish talent by labels finally paying its dues: Young and Dean, for example, are a prime example of why faith and patience can embolden artists to reach their full potential.

It was a five-hour travel and then six out on the boat ride to the middle of the ocean. It was the coolest thing. It blew my mind.” That brand of fearlessness seems par for the course for Collins, whose Flight Risk , released earlier this year on Sony Music Nashville, doesn’t play it safe. Instead, Collins infuses her style of country with a heavy dose of rock and heavy metal. “When I was growing up everyone was listening to Jesse McCartney or pop bands, but I was obsessed with Slash,” Collins says. “I loved Guns N’ Roses, Tom Petty, Alice in Chains. When I was older, my Nana gave me a stack of records when I asked for a record player, and that was Willie Nelson and George Jones [records]. And I discovered How…",
