Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it.

If you've been a PC enthusiast for as long as I have, then you'll probably look at SilverStone's new full-tower case with a warm heart and happy, fuzzy feelings. That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm. It comes with two 120 mm fans installed at the front, below the ro…",

Gamers are a cosseted bunch, and it was (heck, it continues to be) very rare that an open world didn't stick you right back in the protagonist's boots after credits rolled, so you could go mop up whatever side quests and activities you hadn't done yet. RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish. Why didn't he? Because unlike RDR, killing off Niko just didn't quite gel with how Rockstar had set up GTA 4. \"You know, the game do…",

While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket.

Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.

Alas, it's just been delayed by a month, mere hours before its scheduled November 6 release date. According to RJ Lake at studio D-Cell Games, the delay is unavoidable. \"There’s a very boring and frustrating reason,\" Lake wrote on Steam . \"QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.\" In other words, a rare progress-blocking bug was discovered at the eleventh hour and, because pushing updates to console platforms is much more time-consuming than it is on Steam, the studio and its publisher Playstack have decided to push the whole affair back by a month. Unbeatable will now release on December 9. That is over a month from the game's expected launch, which is probably frustrating for anyone looking f…",

And now Ball x Pit is slightly better because the November patch fixes a bunch of bugs, and as the top patch note explains, the encyclopedia has been updated with full-color icons. This may seem like a small thing, but the original version not only looked bland, but made it tough to tell at a glance whether you were looking at, say, a poison ball or an ice ball. Now that one is green and the other blue like God intended that's no longer an issue. (It was enough of an annoyance there was even a now-redundant Encyclopedia Colored mod .) The update also changes the way the retry option works: \"Retry no longer causes resources gained in previous run to be lost\".

Rockstar and parent company Take-Two did not immediately explain the cause of the firings after the news broke last week , initially saying only that the employees were guilty of \"gross misconduct.\" In a statement sent to Bloomberg this week, the developer elaborated, saying that the workers had been \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" The IWGB, however, says that the only Rockstar outsiders the employees were speaking to were labor organizers.

Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders. The reason was pretty obvious once I considered it: heat and smoke rise, so raising someone off the ground is going to increase the amount of heat and smoke they're subjected to.

Sirland didn't respond to everybody, of course, but he did comment on a lot of the issues gnawing at players—maps, recoil, dispersion, and that laser targeting bug that's ruining the lives of heli pilots, to name a few. He also noted what fixes we can expect from the next big BF6 patch, which will arrive in the \"near future.\" Below is a recap of Sirland's impromptu AMA, broken down by topic. Bots A lot of folks complained about bots in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Sirland wrote a secondary thread outlining exactly how bots are used in the game. None of this is stuff we didn't already know—bots are used to seed servers as they're spinning up and are supposed to be replaced by real players—but he acknowledged that this proc…",

Anything on the internet that begins with \"my friend said\" triggers immediate suspicion, but the image of the ban message looks legit, and more to the point the listed fix does apparently work. My friend make a post on steam about disabling crossplay on PC and here is a result from r/Battlefield6 This is notable, because while the console versions of Battlefield 6 lets players toggle crossplay on or off, the PC version—so I'm told, I can't run it myself so I can't check—cannot.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it . Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted landed with a sub-50% \"mixed\" rating on Steam, quite a contrast to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating the old GOTY Edition holds.

But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.
