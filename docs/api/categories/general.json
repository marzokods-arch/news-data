    "body": "For anyone hoping against hope that the memory supply crisis just might start to stabilise in 2026, I've got bad news: An executive at Kioxia, a memory manufacturer based in Japan, recently admitted that the company's production volume for the year is already sold out. The managing director of Kioxia's memory business unit, Shunsuke Nakato, made the admission during an interview with Korean news outlet Digital Daily , elaborating that the ever-hungry AI industry's demand for memory has led to a challenging supply and demand situation. Nakato went on to say that, as many companies are continuing to invest in AI out of a fear of being left behind, the situation is likely to continue into 2027 at least. Though memory supplies are limited, Kioxia is apparently deploying something of a 'gentleman's agreement' with its clients, remaining committed to existing contracts rather than adopting a 'first-come, first-served' or 'everything to the highest bidder' approach. However, Nakato also admits that even long-term Kioxia customers are having to contend with as much as a 30% year-on-year price increase. Also interesting to note from this interview is Nakato's scepticism about QLC tech. For…",

    "body": "While Hytale 's early access experience is surprisingly good (in spite of the developer Hypixel's warnings), there are some clear holes. The biggest one for me is its rather linear progression based around moving through the zones to find new ores, from copper and iron to cobalt , adamantite , and mithril. I'd forgive you for believing that your end goal right now is finding mithril ore, but that's not the case. Mithril's not actually available yet, despite it being required for several recipes listed in-game. The good news is that, when it's eventually added, it won't just be another block to break—presumably in the unreleased fifth zone. Hypixel's founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, says , \"We got some fun ideas about Mithril… let’s say it won't be as simple to mine as the others\". As for what these ideas are, exactly, that of course remains to be seen, and it's added to an already long list of to-dos the team already has to tackle— Collins-Laflamme only bought back the project two months ago and whipped up the early access build in record time, after all. Nevertheless, changes and new features are coming out at a breakneck pace right now, such as adding the ability to hide armour …",

In the meantime, Bungie's 'money maker' Destiny 2's been in a consistent decline since the release of the widely panned Lightfall expansion. Sadly, even during its prime, it felt like an uphill battle to recommend and convince other people to actually play Destiny. Bungie must've felt the same way, clearly, as it's just had to make an all-time great patch note to a back-end Steam bug: \"We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam.\" Now that's a bold strategy to boost the player count. We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam.

The tech has been in development for some time, though startup Weebit Nano Limited has just signed a licensing deal with semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments to finally bring it to a broader audience. According to Weebit Nano , this agreement will see its ReRAM tech \"integrated into [Texas Instruments] advanced process nodes for embedded processing semiconductors.\" Despite what the name suggests, ReRAM isn't actually Random Access Memory, but a Non-Volatile Memory (think NAND, but not—I'll elaborate shortly). So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

    "body": "Control was one of the best games of 2019 , which is high praise: that was the year Disco Elysium, Untitled Goose Game, and Sekiro released. We gave it our \"Best Setting\" award, because even though Control is pretty much a third-person shooter at heart, its presentation elevates it into something much more interesting. This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment. That's for the Ultimate Edition too, which means you also get both expansions and all post-launch content bundled in. A bunch of …",

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.

You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it.

As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode.

As reported by The Hacker News , ReliaQuest recently spotted a phishing scam that prompts a user to download a self-extracting archive . It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate. Thankfully, that won't be the case for much longer. Hytale Update 2, which arrives in pre-release testing sometime this week, will add the ability to hide your helmet and armour.
