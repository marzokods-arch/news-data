It's become a bit of a running joke in the Final Fantasy 14 community that the MMO will never get Blitzball, with the game's director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) playfully scolding players during Dawntrail's pre-release when talking about Gold Saucer updates. Well, jokes on him, because Blitzball's actually alive and well in FF14. I have been to a match (big up the Buccaneers), cheered in a crowd, and even gotten myself a special novelty hat, all without a single lick of game code actually dedicated to it. The Etheirys Blitzball League (also known as the EBL) is a roleplay community that hosts and runs in-game tournaments of the fantasy sport. After attending a game, I simply had to see how it was done—and as it turns out, Blitzball has an entire rules document dedicated to it, one that's over 140 slides long.

But I'm not here to talk about Mario. I'm here to talk about Yoshi. Yoshi, Baby Mario's foster father and adult Mario's horse, is the headlining new character in the Super Mario Galaxy movie, which appears to be a neverending tapestry of references for theater-attending videogame players to point at and whisper, \"I remember that guy\" to their spouses and/or parents. The new teaser Illumination put out yesterday is packed with visuals and characters from Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart, Mario Sunshine, and the titular Galaxy. What's notable about this teaser is that Yoshi does that thing that he does. He gobbles up Kamek the Magikoopa in slow-motion with a flick of his tongue and then poops him out, his glasses comically intact over the fresh egg.

I decided to mark it with a quiz. But which quiz? We've had BG3 quizzes before, and the game is so dog-eared from repeat playthroughs by fans that it's difficult to come up with something truly challenging. Then it hit me: gnomes. Gnomes are great; they're literally just weird little guys, and BG3's gnome characters are some of its finest.

But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within.

Sometimes you want to say things to them, like \"Don't let your adult children play bassy music until 2AM\", or \"Don't leave your dog alone at home all day so he spends the whole. Time. Barking.\" But for the sake of a peaceful life, you don't. Instead, you sit there, quietly seething. When you move out, though, all bets are off, and you can tell everyone who lives nearby exactly how you feel. And I've never seen a moving out message sent quite so spectacularly as by Rust player and reddit user UniverseBear, who constructed a giant, illuminated middle finger to say sayonara to his server buddies. As seen in UniverseBear's reddit post , the flashing flip-off is emblazoned on the side of a rectangular tower built from corrugated iron and concrete. The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist. It seems this is something of a tradition for UniverseBear, a way to cap off a round of Rust when the server is due to be wiped. \"Making one of these is often how I like to end a successful wipe,\" he wrote, before detailing how exactl…",

'Obsession' isn't a strong enough word to describe my last three weeks with this bizarre roguelike strategy game/cat breeding simulator. Its core loop—taking adventuring parties of feline warriors out to face the dangers of the neighborhood, returning with the spoils (or four dead cats), and managing your household to raise a new generation for the next expedition—has kept me enthralled for 100 hours and counting. And after all that time, I'm still discovering new quests, unlocks, secrets, bosses, builds, diseases, unhinged novelty songs, and more.

In particular, Burst Break is of huge importance in this fight, so I hope you've been paying attention—jokes, I'll explain how to use Burst Break down below. I'll also offer some other tips for triumphing against this spear-wielding Takeda clan warrior. After you beat Masakage, you'll complete the prologue section, and be able to enter the rest of the game for real. How to beat Yamagata Masakage in Nioh 3 Though not all that tricky, Yamagata Masakage definitely requires you to adjust to Nioh 3's combat style, in particular, the Burst Break mechanic. Using Burst Break with R (RT on controller), when Yamagata flashes red, will deal big Ki damage (the blue bar below his health), making it easier to stun him and press Y to perform a Grapple that will take a chunk of his health away. Burst Break will also change you from Ninja to Samurai or vice versa, though you can tweak this. This attack is easy to recognise since he'…",

There are three types of skills—general, samurai, and ninja—and each one is increased separately. Luckily, it's not all too tricky to increase your skill capacity, though the boosts are somewhat small and incremental.

It's rather annoying as these Spirit Veins prevent you from accessing some of the last activities you've got to tick off in this area, and you'll find even more Spirit Veins later. Below, I'll explain how Spirit Veins work and how to get the compatible Guardian Spirits you need. How to access Spirit Veins in Nioh 3 Team Ninja Team Ninja There are different types of Spirit Veins, and to use them, you need to unlock the corresponding Guardian Spirit by progressing through the main story. For example, after beating Jakotsu-baba and clearing the Crucible at Hamamatsu Castle, you'll unlock Enko, a fire tiger Guardian Spirit.
