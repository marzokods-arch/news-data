    "body": "A couple of weeks ago, at the start of Overwatch 2 Season 19, the devs made a bold decision to change the format of Stadium, the most recent third-person addition, and a new favourite for many players. Stadium's competitive format changed from best-of-seven to best-of-five, the structure that Stadium Quick Play has had and continues to have. But just two weeks into this update, and the devs have gone back to best-of-seven. (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) \"We are reverting the format of Ranked Stadium back to best of 7,\" the recent patch notes say. \"This is a direct result of both player feedback and internal data. Best of 7 provides players with more space to let their builds breathe and, of course, make those incredible comebacks. Thank you for all of the thoughtful feedback.\" The initial change was done as a bit of an experiment. The devs wanted to see if switching the structure up could solve complaints from players that, past round five, matches would snowball with powers and items becoming too strong for players to handle. And it did just that. Not only were Stadium games faster with the best-of-five format, but with less time for teams to purchase tonnes of expensive …",

Few properly achieve that, happy to focus on just one area while abstracting away others. But the grand strategy genre is always about expanding the view, incorporating into its wargame roots systems of politics, economics and culture. Europa Universalis 5 widens the frame again, adding a new wrinkle: People. It's nothing less than an attempt at simulating the world for centuries with a fidelity beyond anything else in the genre. You play as the controlling force behind a country over 500 years of history, 1337 to 1836, using the same mechanical simulation to present both the late medieval and the entirety of the early modern period.

I'm a sucker for replaying the games I love, but I often find NG+ modes can leave me feeling cold. I always want new story beats or remixed levels, like Dark Souls 2's devious black phantom mixups and upgraded bosses, but so often a NG+ run can feel flat, with retained gear and levels just trivializing the experience and removing any feeling of progression or reward. Labyrinth of the Demon King sounds like it's doing things right, tempting me to jump back into my second playthrough (where I learned from my mistakes and unlocked the game's best katana ) and punch through to the new stuff. The Steam page for the update promises \"new weapons, new enemies, new upgraded enemies, a new NG+ mechanic ( don't want to spoil it⁠—experience it for yourself! ) new NPC interactions & peeks into the world's lore, and a new… boss ?\" The new…",

Jerry O'Flaherty, art director on the original Deus Ex, gave his reaction to the remaster during a recent sit-down with FRVR . It did not seem positive. \"Oh, what the fuck,\" said O'Flaherty. \"No. This did not need to happen. Sorry whoever was involved in this. Oh man, yeah, no.\" So not exactly a thumbs-up, there. Still, O'Flaherty does—sort of—get a bit more positive. \"If you’re gonna do it, yeah, alright, why not? Why am I judging?\" Which is less approval so much as it is resignation to the whims of fate. I can't fault the guy. Deus Ex was never a graphical powerhouse, but it had a vibe and a cohesive aesthetic all the way back in the year 2000. \"You wanted to lean into what the engine did well and don’t do the shit that it doesn’t do well,\" said O'Flaherty. The remaster, as we've seen it so far, trades all that in for a slapdash up-rezzing of everything, making the game too bright, too bulky, and strangely even more archaic-looking than it did originally.

    "body": "Halloween is upon us, and I have a treat for you--and by \"I,\" I mean GOG, but I'm telling you about it so hey, let's give some credit where it's due. Anyway, the treat in question is Stasis , the excellent 2015 point-and-click horror adventure from The Brotherhood, which is free for the taking on GOG until November 3. Stasis is a perfect choice for Halloween gaming. You awaken from cryogenic stasis aboard a not-quite-abandoned spaceship in the middle of what was supposed to be a routine trip to Titan: The crew is dead, your wife and daughter are missing, and unpleasantness abounds. Narrative twists and turns follow, leading through a story that's not especially novel but still manages to deliver surprises. A lot of that arises from your freedom to make a mess of things: Your in-game avatar isn't the most hard-charging videogame hero imaginable, and there are many ways to die, most of them awful. The game itself is also surprisingly gross for an isometric point-and-clicker. (Which I mean as a compliment.) So it's a good time! And it is in fact a very good game, creepy and horrific but not really frightening , so it's manageable even if you tend not to care for scary games. Can't be…",

Nothing quite exemplifies this more than the great big silver Xbox prototype shown off just before the release of Sony's mega-popular PlayStation 2. One YouTuber, Macho Nacho Productions (via Hackaday ), is such a big fan of this aesthetic that they've decided to build their own version, complete with a custom-milled aluminium chassis and the original Xbox internals, albeit with some light upgrades to bring it slightly more into the modern age.. To try and get an understanding of the specific size of the prototype Xbox, Macho Nacho found an image with a Microsoft Sidewinder game pad next to it that was captured at some point in the early 2000s. After comparing a 3D rendering of the two side by side, they then decided that it wasn't quite accurate enough. Macho Nacho took a trip out to New York to see a prototype in a display case, where they took pictures of that case from many angles and sent them to a 3D modeller, where they then created a Gaussian Splat.

Earlier this month, Yokohama City University's Minds1020Lab began trialling \"anime therapy\", as reported by itmedia (thanks, Automaton , for the translation). Here's how it works: Participants will choose one of six anime avatars, each with their unique backstory. Then, in what looks to be a visual-novel style interface, a psychologist will take on the role of said anime character and conduct a counselling session. Some questionnaire-based psychological evaluation happens before and after these sessions, too. Something interesting that's implied here, per Automaton, is the fact that a large chunk of these sessions will also be devoted to learning about these anime characters and their place in the fictional world that Minds1020Lab has set up, here.

Credit to Hemsworth, his performance is indeed: Fine. As if by design, the season's writing stuffs Geralt behind the rest of his adventuring party where he can't commit the sin of being memorable, even for being great, however unlikely that would have been. The Witcher season 4 begins with a set of flashbacks recapping the series so far, sliding Hemsworth into retellings of old scenes as if he'd been there all along. It's a weird first gambit—Netflix attempting to swap the dead goldfish on us even though we've known this was coming for years.

    "body": "I keep a pretty close eye on all the games Hollywood is turning into movies, and I'm well aware that just because a development deal is struck doesn't mean a film will ever get made. Take the Just Cause movie, which was announced way back in 2011 and still hasn't materialized , or the Beyond Good and Evil film announced in 2020 that is just as MIA as Beyond Good and Evil 2 . So when a Call of Duty film adaptation was announced last month, I figured there was a chance we might not hear about it for a while—or maybe not ever again. Wrong. Activision and Paramount just announced that Taylor Sheridan, co-creator of your dad's favorite TV show and its roughly 36 different spinoffs, Yellowstone, is writing the script for the Call of Duty movie. Co-writing and directing is Peter Berg, developer of Friday Night Lights. Sheridan is a huge get—NBCUniversal reportedly spent in the neighborhood of $1 billion to woo him away from Paramount starting in 2029—and as a result Call of Duty is suddenly looking like a huge movie. No stars have been announced yet, but I'd bet money Mark Wahlberg is blowing up Sheridan's phone right about now. At least we can assume Frank Grillo and Jon Bernthal will b…",

    "body": "Repo's Monster Update—that's literally what it's called, unless you want to roll with the far more snooze-inducing v0.3.0—is now live on Steam. As promised it's a big one, with new upgrades, valuables, rooms to explore, and enemies to deal with—and, as PC Gamer's very own Repo man Lincoln Carter is especially excited about, \" butt physics .\" \"Butt physics,\" for the record, does not actually appear in the Monster Update patch notes: Instead, it's a sort of unmentioned spin-off effect of the new Tumble Grab feature, which gives players the ability to grab \"objects, items and weapons\" while tumbled. But as Lincoln explained in September, the ability also enables some new, off-label behavior: By grabbing the floor, you can shake your physics-enabled moneymaker at nearby enemies with enough enthusiasm to, in the words of developer Semiwork, \"twerk them to death.\" So that's pretty cool, if you're into that sort of thing. The 10 new enemies should also help make life a little more interesting, as well 20 new rooms in the Museum of Human Art, two in Headman Manor, and one in Swiftbroom Academy. The update also integrates Discord \"rich presence,\" meaning you'll be able to see and join your…",

Things have settled now and the game is holding steady at around 25,000 concurrent players on Steam—which isn't half bad for an early access game still getting its footing. But developer Chief Rebel decided to make up for the shaky launch by giving away nine Halloween skins for free instead of selling them. \"We know that those first few days were really rocky,\" community director Hamish Bode said in an update video about the new Halloween event. \"We just want to have some fun, so let's do this thing.\" From today until November 13, finishing 10 dungeons on each hero will grant you their Halloween-themed skin. Tank players can turn the martial artist Meiko into a jiangshi; damage hero players can give Mara a witch outfit; and healers can drape a bed sheet over the dwarf character Vigour and turn him into a ghost. There are also two broomstick mounts available for a small bit of gold you can earn after a few dungeons. Much like Wor…",
