Sic transit gloria mundi. It's not just us singing the game's praises, though (but we are definitely singing them in a cooler way than everyone else). At the time of writing, Dispatch has an enviable Overwhelmingly Positive rating in its Steam reviews, numerous games crit garlands and, probably most significantly for its devs, it's set to hit its best-case-scenario three-year sales target in, oh, about three months. That's per Michael Choung, Dispatch's executive producer, who told GI.biz that, pre-release, AdHoc Studio had nurtured a dream \"bull case\" for the game's sales that it hoped to reach over the game's entire lifetime (which the studio's numbers guys put at three years). \"We're on track to do that in three months,\" said Choung.

But sequels, spin-offs, and sourcebooks have a habit of choosing particular outcomes as the \"real\" ones—unless it's the Elder Scrolls, where every ending of Morrowind happened at once. Baldur's Gate 3 had to deal with characters from Baldur's Gate 2 having canonical events happen to them between games, like Minsc and Boo being turned to stone or Viconia and Saarevok backsliding into evil, and now the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 are in the same boat. The latest Forgotten Realms supplements, Adventures in Faerûn and Heroes of Faerûn, move the timeline on from 1492—when BG3 happens—to 1501, and hint at the fates of its cast. Quotes from Karlach crop up throughout Adventures in Faerûn and she appears more than once in the art for both books alongside Astarion, Shadowheart, and Minsc. And in none of those illustrations is she a mind flayer or a pile of ash—two of the potential outcomes for her in Baldur's Gate 3. The best ending for Karlach is that she returns to Avernus with the Infernal Engine still burning away inside her chest…",

The problem, for PC gamers at least, is that Madness Returns has a pretty rough port that's only gotten harder to work with since its release in 2011; until now, anyway. Modder Wemino has undertaken the noble task of brushing up the port themselves, and released the initial build of their custom MadnessPatch Friday. It's remarkably feature-rich for a fanmade patch: not only does it improve textures, force subtitles to scale correctly above 720p, and adjust the camera for ultrawide resolutions, it also addresses crashes, fixes up broken physics at high framerates, and helps the game run in windowed mode without it throwing a fit. In other words, it's hard to imagine going back to an unmodded build. You might know Wemino from their other excellent patches: EchoPatch for best-in-class horror FPS F.E.A.R. and VorpalFix for the original Alice game, which I used (with great results!) for a recent playthrough.

User Hefty_Present_4160 shared a short video of the actors' appearance to the Fallout subreddit. \"We got a second season coming out, wait 'till you see this, guys,\" Moten said to the crowd, joking that season two was \"DLC\" for season one. \"We can't wait to share it with all of you. Thank you. Appreciate all of you so much.\" Then Goggins cut in: \"You know what, we also have a third season too, I'm just saying.\" VIDEO OF WALTON GOGGINS, AARON MORTEN AND JONATHAN NOLAN ANNOUNCING FALLOUT SEASON 3 AT GOODSPRINGS from r/Fallout Variety reported on the show's renewal all the way back in May, but I don't think I'm alone in this being my first time hearing about it: Hefty_Present_4160 also characterized this as a first announcement of season three, and many of the commenters seemed surprised as well.

If you couldn't tell from all the things I've written about it, I love videogame music. Even before big-budget studios were employing whole-ass orchestras to perform grand symphonies, composers were making full use of synthesizers and sound chips to create pieces that would've had Beethoven telling all his pals \"Have you heard that One Winged Angel? It's pretty good.\" Videogame music is home to so many bangers that it would be a huge disservice if they were forever confined to the games they were created for, which is where the humble videogame concert comes in. It's a chance to hear your favourite tracks brought to life by an in-person orchestra, often complemented by visuals from the game and maybe even a guest appearance from the composer themselves. To my surprise, the first videogame concert happened far earlier than I ever anticipated—in August 1987 according to GameConcerts , where Dragon Quest composer Koichi Sugiyama presented the Fami…",

But in a year where Call of Duty hasn't been so challenged in arguably well over a decade, largely thanks to Battlefield 6 , it's the small changes that matter just as much as sweeping ones. That said, a co-op campaign, an SBMM-free playlist, more Mastery Camos , Hybrid Combat Specialities, and double jumps are a pretty good list of sizable changes, even if it's not a radical reinvention. That's cool and all, but I'm more hyped about Overclocks, one of the few major upgrades to scorestreaks since Modern Warfare 3 (the first one) introduced point streaks—and it's a callback to the maligned Advanced Warfare of all things.

Broadly, Vein is a familiar affair, plonking you in an open world where civilization has been overrun by zombies and tasking you with staying alive in its sandbox. Like Zomboid, its appeal lies in its high level of granularity, with players able to interact with pretty much anything in its world.\"Open mailboxes, adjust faucets, and knock on doors,\" the game's Steam page promises, adding \"throw a can of beans at a zombie if you like.\" I do like. But all of this is presented in 3D, with dynamic seasons and highly perceptive undead.

In short, there's plenty of motivation for Facepunch to keep Garry's Mod fresh, and its latest patch livens up how it looks and functions in several ways. Primarily, the November update improves Garry's Mod's water visuals, introducing fluid rendering features from more recent Source engine games. As the update's Steam post notes. \"This includes flow maps, lightmaps, and [the] ability to reflect 3D skybox.\" However, Facepunch cautions that the changes \"may unexpectedly affect a small amount of existing maps\" due to some map creators already using modified water materials pulled from newer Source games. \"This is unfortunately unavoidable from our end and will need to be individually fixed by ma…",

As the series entered its second decade, it had already begun to veer away from historical drama and behind-the-headlines espionage. Treyarch was developing drone swarms for Black Ops 2, and Infinity Ward had dared to kick off the singleplayer campaign of Call of Duty: Ghosts in space. (Image credit: Activision) What Schofield was proposing, though, was something different: a futuristic moveset that would interfere with the fundamentals of CoD's sacred multiplayer component. Rather than merely providing novelty in the campaign, the boost jump would change the rules of competitive deathmatch, enabling players to reach high rooftops in newly vertiginous maps, and gain an edge through skilful combination of double jumps and mid-air dashes. If the idea backfired—drawing ire from a community which had grown used to its annualised fix of familiar FPS action—then Activision would be facing a serious threat to its most reliable cash cow.

In a first-floor flat above San Fierro's Chinatown, the amiable Triad leader Woozie is on the couch, clutching a gamepad. He's busy thrashing CJ Johnson in competitive multiplayer, much to the consternation of our protagonist. \"How are you in the water?\" Woozie asks, changing the subject. \"Can you swim well?\" \"No,\" replies CJ. \"I can't.\" The cutscene is a reflection of the background stat tracking that goes on in GTA: San Andreas—recording the player's weapon skill, driving ability, stamina, muscle, fat, and most pertinently, lung capacity. This moment in particular is notorious among GTA fans, since it demands you raise your underwater swimming skill to 20% before proceeding to the next mission—an oceanic infiltration of a cargo ship which must be completed to see the rest of the game.

But from CD Projekt's perspective, success seemed far from certain in the runup to launch. In particular, the Polish studio was deeply concerned about competition from another game released that summer, Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham Knight . The concern didn't derive purely from the fact that Arkham Knight was a hotly anticipated game. CD Projekt was more specifically worried that Rocksteady's open-world superhero game would shunt The Witcher 3 off the shelves at retailers. Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski explained the situation as it stood in early 2015: \"There was a big question about the execution of the marketing, are we going to be, you know, on par with, with the biggest out there?\" he said. \"We had huge, huge discussions, especially with the retail in the US, but also UK, you know, the main markets, Germany and so on, because it was about convincing them that we can actually be allowed to spend money in those channels.\" Nowakowski explains that retailers have different windows duri…",

The sequel, Salt 2: Shores of Gold , made some big improvements in that regard, while also enhancing the series' PvE focus and adding an infinite, procedurally generated world to explore. After spending the last three years in early access—during which Salt 2 gained a main quest, cooperative multiplayer, skill trees and underwater exploration among other things—it has now left alpha development , blasting a broadside of new features into Salt 2's hull to round out the core experience.

It even introduces unique game modes. One thing the original version of the mod didn't offer, however, is multiplayer, due to how FromSoftware prohibits modded games from connecting to official servers. But the recently released 2.0 version of Elden Ring: Reforged addresses this, with the team creating a custom server to enable fully functional, FromSoft-style multiplayer. Update 2.0 introduces pretty much everything you'd expect from playing Elden Ring with other people. Summoning, invasions, and leaving messages for other players.

The problem? Fish, apparently. I managed to play a little bit today without a ton of issues, but I wasn't the only one who experienced severe lag. Blizzard's been trying to figure out what's causing all the problems since the beta launched on Tuesday, and discovered yesterday that it might be some new fish technology that's bringing Azeroth to a crawl. \"We're still plugging away at this but we think we found a new problem,\" game producer Zorbrix wrote in a forum thread about the lag. \"FISH!\" They explained how there's new NPC behavior that's supposed to help creatures \"react to players and the environment in a more natural way\" instead of randomly wandering around and that it could be going haywire when too many players are nearby.
