    "body": "With everything moving to a subscription model and increasing cloud dependence, we are living in the era of the forever tax. Between Spotify, Netflix, and cloud storage, we pay for music, movies, and to keep our own digital memories safe. And while cloud storage started as a convenient utility with fairly minimal charges for an additional 100GB of storage when photos were all we uploaded, that’s not the case anymore. Between years of data archives, larger photo files, and even larger 4K video-first content capture being the norm, for many of us, it has morphed into a significant monthly bill that we aren’t really in a position to cancel. Over here at Android Authority , we’ve talked about Network Attached Storage, or NAS , as a solution for the privacy-conscious or the tech-savvy enthusiasts who want to de-Google their lives and reduce their cloud dependence. We’ve even talked about data sovereignty and actually owning your files in a world that desperately wants you to rent them. But while all that is great, cost is another significant factor to consider. The fact of the matter is that a significant chunk of users considering a local storage option are only trying to reduce their…",

The British rocker touched down in Sydney earlier this week and quickly drew massive fan attention after attending a pop-up photo gallery exhibition in Newtown, where crowds reportedly became so large that police were called to manage the situation. The event, titled Yungblud: IDOLS , featured photography by British photographer Tom Pallant and showcased images from previous legs of the singer’s ongoing tour. Yungblud — born Dominic Harrison — had encouraged fans to attend the gallery via social media, telling them he would be there in person. Hundreds reportedly queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the artist, with some lining up from early morning. Though no major incidents were reported, the turnout was large enough that authorities asked the event to wrap earlier than planned. “Yo guys, I love you so much, thank you for coming out,” Yungblud said in a voice memo shared to fans afterward. “That got a bit f—ing hectic, didn’t it?

Of course, Motorola has been fairly responsive to my concerns (and those of others) over its last few generations, so my list of persistent issues has dwindled to just one remaining. If you’ve read any of my recent reviews, you’ll know what’s coming, but here’s what Motorola needs to improve as we head into a new year.",

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands.

Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees.

    "body": "Credit: Chase Bernath / Android Authority CES has no shortage of big-screen tech, but Aurzen’s focus this year is on portability of projection and how far that idea can be pushed. At CES, Aurzen is showcasing the cream of its projector lineup, with an emphasis on compact designs and use cases that go well beyond the living room. The company’s presence at the show centres on three product families: the ZIP Cyber Edition, the BOOM series, and a new range of Roku TV–powered smart projectors. Together, they frame Aurzen’s view of portable projection as something flexible enough for travel, cars, and casual home setups.",

Yet, a growing market only means more room for competition and a more confusing shopping experience. After testing countless smartwatches over the years, I’ve honed in on what makes a device the most valuable, including user experience, feature set, fitness tracking tools, and sensor package, without forgetting about comfort and looks. Depending on what ecosystem you belong to, the watches below represent the top smartwatches I recommend in 2026 so far. Google Pixel Watch 4: The best smartwatch for Android users When Google first entered the smartwatch space, the Pixel Watch line took a few generations to find its footing. The Pixel Watch 4 absolutely delivers. To start, the newest model offers the most complete Wear OS experience yet, pairing Google’s Tensor G4 chipset with the powerful Wear OS platform for faster performance, smoother navigation, and stronger integration across the Pixel ecosystem.",

It’s the type of Android phone that Samsung and Google won’t make, but another company did, and it’s called the Punkt MC03. Punkt may not be a household name, but it’s also not brand new to the smartphone world. The company launched its MC02 phone in February 2024 with the same goal of creating a privacy-focused handset. It wasn’t a complete success, but it was a promising glimpse into Punkt’s vision for Android’s future.",

Don’t get me wrong, I can definitely see the progress I’ve made in my Spanish learning journey. I pick up on things when I hear Spanish, and I’m usually able to piece together what’s being said. However, contributing to the conversation is an entirely different beast. Duolingo sprinkles speaking exercises into its lessons, but the functionality feels more like a smaller piece of the puzzle rather than the focus. Speak , another language learning app that I’ve been watching from afar over the last few years, turns this strategy on its head, and the difference has been eye-opening to me. Speak first, sweat the details later",

The phone is also tipped to have a 6.3-inch 165Hz screen, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a 50MP tele camera. The OnePlus 13S/13T had a very limited release, but we hope the new phone is widely available. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 13T in China last year, which was known as the OnePlus 13s in India. This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",
