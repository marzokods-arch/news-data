She&#8217;s probably exhausted &#8212; it would be understandable if she was sick and tired of life on the go &#8212; but if either of those things were true, the thousands of fans at the UBS Arena in New York on Saturday night (Oct. 25) would never have been able to tell. The singer &#8212; who previously stopped through NYC&#8217;s Madison Square Garden in October 2024 &#8212; was poised, energetic and appeared to be having the the time of her life on stage, playing the first of two back-to-back shows at the venue on her mammoth Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour supporting last year&#8217;s album of the same name. If anything, Eilish&#8217;s marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don&#8217;t Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration &#8220;Guess&#8221; with impressive stamina and musicality. And despite a headline-making instance of an over-aggressive concertgoer forcibly yanking her at a show in Miami, the best part of Saturday&#821…",

    "body": "Three decades ago, Bette Midler eyed trash-filled parks in New York City with a mixture of dismay and anger. But unlike most people who complain about things in NYC, she did something about it—and inspired countless others to follow in her footsteps. In 1995, the actress-singer-comedian tapped her connections and resources to form the New York Restoration Project (NYRP), which over the course of the last 30 years has cleaned up, transformed and created green spaces for New Yorkers across the five boroughs, with a focus on helping underserved communities get the green space they deserve as much as the loaded locales living across from Central Park. Part of the NYRP’s fundraising arm is its annual Hulaween gala, an explosion of costumed creativity that took over Manhattan’s Cipriani South Street on Friday (Oct. 24) night to mark 30 years of the Tony-, Grammy-, Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning icon&#8217;s nonprofit. And what better way to salute the tart-tongued talent than publicly insult her. “We’re here for the late Bette Midler,” joked surprise performer Buddy Young Jr., aka Billy Crystal resurrecting the character from his 1992 dramedy Mr. Saturday Night. “Talk about a restoratio…",
