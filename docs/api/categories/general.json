The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said.

Yesterday, I tested a very similar chip , the 9700K, in a rig with a Radeon RX 5700 XT and 1080p Low quality, and the CPU was frequently hitting 100% utilisation in the open world (see below).

Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean? Luckily, tucked away at the bottom of the 'gameplay' tab in the settings menu is the radar display .

There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players.
