Now we've seen it: in a surprise trailer during Sony's Japan-focused State of Play livestream on Tuesday, the studio debuted The Forsaken Hollows , its first expansion dropping December 4. And one of the studio's all-time great bosses is coming back. At the 1:15 mark in the trailer above, Artorias of the Abyss from the first Dark Souls appears as a new addition to the pool of bosses you'll have to face before one of the end-of-run Nightlords. He's not the first Dark Souls boss to apear in Nightreign: DS1's Gaping Dragon is in the game, too, as one of the easier bosses to dispatch. Something tells me Artorias will be a bit more of a challenge. That something is probably my memory of fighting Artorias in his namesake DLC for Dark Souls, Artorias of the Abyss, released in 2012. While FromSoftware's games are quite fast-paced today, demanding quick reflexes in fights against the likes of Malenia , that wasn't the case in Dark Souls. Many of the bosses are lumbering beasts, and even the fastest foes hav…",

In fact, the entire Limveil map has been transformed by a new event called The Great Hollow. \"A great cavity in the depths of Limveld,\" is how the post on the PlayStation Blog describes it. It's a big hole with a big crystal and everything down there looks terrifying. To fight the new horrors are two new characters: The Scholar and The Undertaker. The Undertaker is a strength- and faith-based character who wields a mace and has an ultimate that sends her flying up to attack enemies. The Scholar looks less mobile, but equipped with a tome he can use to lift enemies up in place. The PlayStation Blog confirms that there are two new Nightlord bosses to fight at the end of each run. One of them is a battalion of angelic knights holding golden spears and the other is, well, some kind of twisted abomination that roars ju…",

PMG originally intended to help publicize the Rockstar employee union this month but was informed about the sudden firing around the same time as Bloomberg's initial report went out. At the time, Rockstar parent company Take-Two said it fired the workers for \"gross misconduct.\" And then, in a statement to Bloomberg last week, it said the workers were \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum,\" and that the abrupt firing was \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" The IWGB says that \"public forum\" was just a private Discord server where employees were speaking with labor organizers and that Rockstar's decision was \"one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the game…",

It took several embarrassing deaths, but eventually I realized there's a whole strategy around building fully-furnished fake shelters to bait, trap, and kill rival players. Sometimes they run out of the basement and blow you up, sometimes they just leave you to starve. Either way, I can't mind my business and I'm paying for it. It's the perfect encapsulation of the creative antagonism that both infuriates me and makes me cry with laughter, but so quintessentially Rust. And the more I try to explain it, the more I realize it's a scheme so diabolically goofy that you just have to see it.

But more interesting to me is the addition of a new map based on New York's Times Square, which will be a \"non-combat map\" where people can just hang out and be cool. The new map is notable to me because Marvel Rivals is a game that is explicitly about not being cool with your fellow costumed crusaders: Blade, you'll recall, can hack his opponents into itty-bitty pieces in an outburst of violence that looks like it belongs in an Elden Ring boss fight. As someone who doesn't play Marvel Rivals I thought at first that I was misunderstanding what was happening, but no, Guangguang is quite clear: No fisticuffs in Times Square! \"Season 5 brings you the grand debut of New York's Times Square,\" he said in today's pre-season 5 update video. \"This is a non-combat map that can host up to 100 players.

We'll also keep an eye on the latest news and developments as we head into Black Friday 2025. Will this year's online firesale be your last chance for vague sensible DDR5 and storage prices? Or will spiralling demand from AI data centres kick in before the sales kick off? Among the very latest developments comes news that a Japanese retailer seems to have run out of PC memory kits and is restricting purchases. The CEO of SSD controller specialist Phison has also recently warned of a shortage of NAND flash chips leading to a doubling of prices in the last six months , while predicting that demand will likely outstrip supply for several years to come.

We want to establish ourselves as the new kings of RPGs.\" As for how Warhorse intends to achieve this, Stolz-Zwilling believes the studio is already on the right track, in the way KCD 2 blends detailed quest design with a reactive, open-ended world that recalls the emergent delights of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion . This, Stolz-Zwilling says, will carry through into whatever Warhorse makes next: \"We believe that we have our own formula here, and that we define them in a specific way, and our next project will go the same direction.

Aerie was a formerly-winged elf who worked in a circus and had a great deal of personal trauma, which she worked out over the course of an extended courtship with you, the male player character. At some point, she would get pregnant, and the resulting child—named, in the blunt language of early CRPGs, \" Aerie's Baby \"—would hold eternal tenure in your already-limited inventory, in a space you might otherwise put a bundle of arrows or a longsword. This is a sequence of events which I now regard as having ruined all of videogames.

Yoshida sat down with games press including MiniMap ahead of Korea's G-Star conference chatting about Stellar Blade's influence , console gaming, and the Korean indie game scene. When asked about how large studios can stay creative, Yoshida said he reckons it's more about them using their money to support smaller developers through publishing. (Image credit: MINTROCKET) He highlighted the fact that both Nexon and Mintrocket have maintained that the former was very hands-off in the latter's development of Dave the Diver—which faced a ton of 'is this an indie game?' discourse around the time of the 2023 Game Awards—saying \"I completely agree with the philosophy that creative freedom should remain untouched.\" \"No one truly knows what kind of game will succeed,\" Yoshida pointed out. \"Not even marketing teams can predict it because they rely on past data and new ideas are, by definition, unprecedented.\" I really do feel like that n…",

Most notably, none of the decisions you make in the Witcher 3 are as momentous as the game-changing choice at the heart The Witcher 2, where choosing to help one of two characters in a fight led to a second act viewed from completely different perspectives. Roughly 90% of The Witcher 2's second-act strands are unique, each with its own locations, key characters, and quests. I've always wondered if CD Projekt will commit so wholly to an in-game decision again. But according to CD Projekt's co-CEO Adam Badowski, such an eventuality is unlikely. Speaking to PC Gamer, Badowski discussed the changes CD Projekt made between The Witcher 2 and 3, noting that the biggest of these was structural. \"In The Witcher 2, we had a very difficult structure of the game, because there are two paths. You can go one path and you won't see the other path,\" he says. \"From the production perspective it's a waste of resources. From [the] player's perspective, it…",

If only I'd fallen into literally any of the massive bodies of water available, I would have survived.

But when it comes to Korean developers breaking out beyond niche MMOs and mobile games, I can't deny that Stellar Blade is one of the forerunners in broadening the region's reach. (Image credit: M Bowles via Getty Images) It's something that Yoshida agrees with, and even reckons that the game's success has bolstered spirits among Korean game developers, particularly when it comes to developing console games. As spotted by GamesRadar (via MiniMap ), the ex-PlayStation boss sat down with press ahead of game development conference G-Star to chat about the Korean indie scene, the role larger corporations play in helping them to thrive, and other console-y related bits.

When I say small, I really do mean small, because Kinesis Gaming has only changed a handful of aspects of the original package. First up are the key switches, which have been swapped from Cherry MX to Gateron Pro v1. This was probably done for cost reasons, but the good news here is that whatever money Kinesis has saved by using different mechanical switches, it's spent it on the lift kit (which tents the keyboard) and Apple Mac modifier keycaps.
