As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover. Steel Soul mode is also present in Silksong, revealed by the presence of the Steel Soul achievement on Steam. But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays. By going to the \"Extras\" menu and entering Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right on your controller, you can unlock the Steel Soul mode immediately.

Lots of great games still release during this period, but the kinds of games that top Steam's wishlist chart tend to cluster at the beginning and end of the year, especially in February and October. This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

The ship from which you launch missions is a kind of mini hub, and I think does the job well, but some players want a more fleshed-out area to mingle with their fellow defenders of democracy and show off all those fancy capes they've been buying: the example usually given is Destiny 2's Tower. Jorjani was replying on Discord to a player asking for \"a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny.)\" Don't hold your breath: \"It's on the feature list for the next one,\" said Jorjani in response. This was not-unreasonably taken as a reference to Helldivers 3, but Jorjani quickly clarified this wasn't what he was on about. \"This was about our next game,\" said Jorjani , \"not HD3.\" (Image credit: Paradox Interactive ) OK, well that's enough for me to st…",

A little over a week since I last brought you the joyous news that Halls of Torment—2024's true game of the year—would be getting a meaty new DLC and free update at some point before the end of the year, the devs have gone and announced exactly when in a post on Steam . The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

In more recent years, the shape of this development has shifted towards the benefits of corporations, with ad spends and SEO demands coming before the needs of the people. In this time search results have notably gotten much, much worse and continue to do so. This has lead to people dropping Google for search , despite it once being so popular we adopted it as a verb. Now we've seen this shift again, with often not-quite-correct chatbots and AI summaries being put forward as an alternative to genuine research and understanding. Let alone the greater environmental implications of the power used to generate such things. At least there's a browser extension that gets rid of them , for now anyway.

However, for reasons that will become clear shortly, the journey between first opening the box and the publication of this review has been faltering and difficult. Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one. The obvious question to ask here is 'why?' and that's an easy one to answer. Naya Create specs (Image cr…",

And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what's particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business. In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021.

The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2.

I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",

The devs considered giving us a gander at the tallywhacker of Adolf Hitler. Spoilers for New Colossus to follow. In one of the game's standout scenes, BJ Blazkowicz finds himself infiltrating a Nazi base on Venus by auditioning for the role of himself in a propaganda movie. It's revealed during the audition that the Fuhrer is executive producing, and a tense, Tarantinoesque standoff ensues. The clearly addled, declining Adolf lurches around the room, muttering about conspiracies and personally executing the actors that fail to impress him. He even urinates right on the floor⁠—more on that in a second. \"We're starting from, 'What would be the coolest locations to play in?'\" said MachineGames co-founder Jens Matthies. \"We want to do Area 52 and we want to do Venus. Okay, but how the fuck are we going from there to there?\" From there, he came up with the idea of the casting call and its surprise producer. Studio head Jerk Gustafsson cited the scene as an example of how the studio uses dark …",

    "body": "To free the town of Bellhart from its cursed webs, you're going to have to defeat the spider spinstress hiding above it: the Widow. This challenging boss is also one of the most fun in Act 1 of Hollow Knight: Silksong, thanks to a quick runback from the nearest bench and a number of attacks that deal only one damage to Hornet rather than the more painful double hits of so many Silksong bosses. The Widow is fast but her attacks are well-telegraphed, so with a little study and patience you can learn her patterns and get through the first phase by making use of your drifter's cloak and new cling grip ability. The second phase gets a bit more chaotic, but I've got some tips for how to beat the Widow in phase two before she smooshes you to death with a rain of bells. What do you need to fight Widow? Here's what I used to beat the Widow, but there's no must-have bit of gear for this fight . I guess that's both good and bad—there's no way to trivialize this fight with a specific weapon, but it also means you don't need to be out there grinding for rosaries before the battle. You've got this! Five masks of health (starting amount) Reaper crest for attack range and easier downstabs Straigh…",
