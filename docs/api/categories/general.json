    "body": "It’s been a quiet start to the year in British pop music, but that’s about to change. In an unexpected move, Robbie Williams has surprise-released his new album, Britpop , three weeks earlier than originally planned. The road to the superstar’s 13th studio album has already been full of twists and turns. First announced last May, the record was slated for release Oct. 10, though was then pushed back to Feb. 6 due to “scheduling issues.” At an i ntimate show at London’s Dingwalls venue Oct. 9, Williams admitted that this was actually due to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination. “We’re all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f–king is &#8212; you can’t compete with that,” Williams said on stage. “I was worried about making [fans] all wait for the record. But then I was like, ‘F–k it.’ I’m sorry, but I’m f–king being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most No. 1 albums the U.K. has f–king ever had?” It was a shrewd decision: Swift’s record remained atop the summit of the U.K.&#8217;s Official Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks upon release.

Lainey texted us and I legitimately had to pull over to the side of the road and I was just sobbing. It was very special. It was bigger than I dreamed—and I got a deer that weekend, too, so it was pretty much the best weekend, ever.” Anderson has co-written nearly a dozen songs that have populated Lainey’s two CMA album of the year-winners Bell Bottom Country and Whirlwind , including the Country Airplay No. 1 “Somewhere Over Laredo” and top 5 hits “Heart Like a Truck,” and “Wildflowers and Wild Horses.” Cole Swindell, Gabby Barrett, Madeline Edwards and Nate Smith have also recorded her songs.
