Magnetic carbon cases are reportedly exclusive to the S26 and S26 Plus, while magnetic silicone cases will cover all models. A mysterious dual magnet holder ring also appears in the leak. If you’ve been waiting for Samsung to catch up with the magnetic features iPhone users have had for years, your patience is about to pay off. A new leak about the Galaxy S26 accessories shows Samsung is fully committing to the Qi2 wireless charging standard . For the last few generations, Android users have had to rely on third-party MagSafe-compatible sticker rings or cases for a secure wireless charging connection. With the Galaxy S26 series, Samsung appears to be making this a built-in feature.",

The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete. Thanks to a recent Canary release, however, I’m now able to demo what the UI for Android’s game controller remapping feature looks like.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.

Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

    "body": "Putting aside the excellent Pixel 5, battery life was never one of the Pixel line-up’s strong suits. The Pixel, Pixel 2, and Pixel 3 started out with average battery life; the Pixel 4 and 6 series were pretty bad, while the Pixel 7 and 8 went back to average. Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G. I hoped the Pixel 10 Pro XL would fix this, but so far, I’m just left scratching my head.",

The Edge 70 Ultra may also join the stylus club, though it’s unclear if it’ll feature a built-in silo or rely on accessories. Motorola looks like it’s heading into 2026 with quiet rather than big changes. New leaks about the Moto G Stylus 2026 and its Moto Tag successor reveal designs that appear familiar, with only slight differences. It looks like Motorola is sticking with what works, focusing even more on texture and how the next Moto G Stylus feels in the hand, and a new image from Android Headlines shows a device that looks a lot like last year’s model.",

However, a Samsung executive recently posted images showcasing a TriFold with four (not three) cameras. We speculate this is likely a dummy or a prototype that wasn’t meant to be released or showcased like this. The recently-launched Galaxy Z TriFold is Samsung’s slimmest phone to date. At its thinnest point, the TriFold measures just 3.9mm (0.15 inches), and trying to achieve this has presumably also forced Samsung to cut out excessive features. The additional fold on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has allowed Samsung to increase the battery size on the TriFold while retaining the same camera system. However, Samsung, at some point, could have been evaluating another camera system — with four rear cameras instead of the three actually present on the foldable.",

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google has released its Year in Search 2025 video, turning the trending searches from last week’s lists into a fast, stylized montage. KPop Demon Hunters, the Labubu craze, Luka trade rumors, Alcaraz vs. Sinner, Charlie Kirk, and scenes of communities rebuilding all feature. The film also pulls in global moments like major cricket matches and a reference to the first American pope. Google already shared the top trending searches of 2025 last week , but now it has released the video version. The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",

A more advanced follow-up to the surprisingly popular Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses (), the new glasses have a monocular display (meaning there’s one screen in one of the lenses), a Neural Band wrist strap that lets you control what you see by performing air gestures, and, most importantly, a price: $799. While expensive, this kept Meta at the forefront of the burgeoning XR revolution by making it the first major tech player to have a retail-ready set of smart glasses that seem to bring us the future Google Glass promised us over 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Meta, there are three major problems with the new Ray-Bans.

Between all its strengths like the unmatched e-ink screen, battery life measured in weeks, and the sheer portability, the Kindle is fundamentally a device built for content consumption. As a tool for reading with limited annotation capabilities, the Kindle lies squarely in Amazon’s walled garden. Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront. For the dedicated reader or an enthusiast like me, if you want to deeply engage with the source material, that consumption-only focus has always been the system’s biggest flaw.

This potential change prioritizes maximum security over convenience, preventing accidental unlocks if your watch is merely nearby. Users will likely need to toggle off Advanced Protection Mode to regain the ability to unlock their Pixel phone via their Pixel Watch. The Google Pixel Watch features a Watch Unlock function that allows you to use the smartwatch as a key to unlock your Pixel phone. This is very convenient, as it replaces the need for a traditional passcode or biometric identification as long as you’re wearing the watch (and it’s connected to your phone). Although the feature is great, there are instances when you don’t want your watch to unlock your phone.
