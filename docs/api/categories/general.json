    "summary": "The twin one-day events mark Rolling Loud’s first shows in Australia since 2019.",
    "body": "Rolling Loud has unveiled the full lineup for its 2026 Australia edition , confirming a heavyweight bill of U.S. rap acts alongside some of the country’s most prominent homegrown names. Rolling Loud Australia is set to take place across two cities in March: Sydney’s Centennial Park on March 7, and Melbourne’s Flemington Racecourse on March 8. The twin one-day events mark Rolling Loud’s first shows in Australia since 2019, and the first time the global hip-hop festival brand has expanded to a two-city format in the country. Gunna will headline the two-city run, following Rolling Loud’s earlier confirmation that the rapper would anchor the event. Ken Carson joins him at top billing, extending the Opium-affiliated artist’s growing presence across the festival’s global footprint. Sexyy Red — previously announced — leads the second tier of performers. The 2026 bill includes several major U.S. rap acts across its main stages. Sexyy Red, Tyga, Swae Lee, Lil Tjay, Ski Mask the Slump God, NLE Choppa, Quavo, Ian and rising rapper Osamason are among the international performers scheduled across the weekend. The lineup spans established touring names, TikTok-driven breakout acts and core Roll…",

    "summary": "The band played their first show in the U.K. since 2017 at The O2 Arena in London.",
    "body": "British music has had such a banner year in 2025, that Radiohead’s return has flown a touch under the radar. With Olivia Dean , Yungblud , Lola Young and RAYE all conquering the Billboard charts in the U.S., and Oasis putting on the biggest tour of the year, the return of the art-rock fivepiece after an seven-year absence feels low-key in comparison. There is no new music to plug, simply a run of shows in major European cities, and an unpredictable setlist – this is as understated as an arena-headlining band could ever dream to be. That said, 2025 has still been notable for the group. Earlier this year they reassessed their 2003 album Hail to The Thief and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company for a new production of Hamlet . Elsewhere “Let Down,” an album track from their 1997 opus OK Computer went viral and landed on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time. Their Spotify monthly listener count now tops 44m users, higher than other British rockers such as Oasis, The Rolling Stones and even The Beatles. All this comes despite a period of relative inactivity. The band’s last LP A Moon Shaped Pool was released in 2016 and the group completed touring for it in 2018. Yorke told T…",
