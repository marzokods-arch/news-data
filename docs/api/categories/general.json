You'll likely have a long trek ahead of you, but grabbing some kelp isn't all that tricky once you know where to look. How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it. Breaking it with any tool or even your hands drops azure petals, which aren't what you want in this case. In …",

    "body": "Here's one that didn't show up on the CES 2026 show floor. Asus has some new dual-mode 4K monitors with uprated, higher-refresh 1080p modes . We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode. So, it's actually the 3x model that hits the higher refresh rate. It's just also starting at a much higher base 4K refresh. …",

As reported by The Hacker News , ReliaQuest recently spotted a phishing scam that prompts a user to download a self-extracting archive . It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

Someone else who's perhaps a tad fed up with the Creation Engine? Dean Carter, lead on Fallout: London, the sweeping Fallout 4 overhaul that transplants you from Boston to the Big Smoke. In a chat with Esports.net , Carter said that—while the Creation Engine actually has a lot of upsides—he's worried Bethesda is gonna stick with it for Fallout 5. \"I’m really worried that they’re gonna keep going with the Creation Engine,\" said Carter. \"I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine… but I do think it started to show its age.\" In particular, it…",

I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate. Thankfully, that won't be the case for much longer. Hytale Update 2, which arrives in pre-release testing sometime this week, will add the ability to hide your helmet and armour.

In a post on its website , IOI's announced that Hitman: World of Assassination is getting cross-progression, and it's set to go live on February 3. The studio says it's wanted to do this for a while—from the start, actually—and it's finally happening: \"it has been our wish to enable this feature for players to be able to carry on their in-game progression… from the 3rd of February onwards, no matter where you choose to play.\" Why's it only happening now? IOI doesn't say, but I'd be shocked if it didn't have something to do with the upcoming release of the game's \"Stone and Knight\" co-op mode . After all, if you're doing the under-the-hood work to let people play together, why not make people's different platform profiles sync, too? The metrics that will be …",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below.

Contrary to what you may have heard, voidhearts aren't exclusive to Void Eyes (the big floating eyes with tentacles). In fact, I've had the best luck getting them to drop from Void Spawns (the humanoid beasts with large swords).

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly.

From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room .

This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit.

While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later.

It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it.
