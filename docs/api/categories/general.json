    "body": "Life is Strange is officially getting a screen adaptation on Amazon Prime Video, first reported by Variety . The show will retell the story of the first game in the series, which was originally released in 2015 by Don't Nod. It's too early for any casting announcements, but we know who will be writing and producing. Leading the series is Charlie Covell, who will be the writer, executive producer, and showrunner. You may already be familiar with Covell's work—they also wrote Netflix's Kaos and The End of the F***ing World⁠—Netflix's censorship, not ours⁠—both of which are dripping in dark comedy. In a statement to Variety, Covell described helming the Life is Strange show as \"a huge honor,\" saying, \"I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike.\" Along with Covell, the series will also be executive produced by the Story Kitchen team, which is also working on adaptations of Tomb Raider , Split Fiction, and It Takes Two, all at Amazon. Story Kitchen's founder, Dmitri M. Johnson, was also a co-producer on all th…",

How many Dragon Age games would you say there are? Only four, right? Origins, its sequel, Inquisition and last year's Veilguard. Not many, for a beloved franchise spanning a decade and a half at a major publisher. But then the BioWare team behind the series was often characterised as a pirate ship by colleagues: sailing haphazardly between projects and often drifting off course as it found its way to its next hit. Certainly, there was never a straightforward follow-up that built directly on the success of Origins. BioWare's pirates were routinely tossed about on the rough seas of EA's whims, following mandates for tight budgets or new engines or live service features. Those internal skirmishes added years to the development of mainline Dragon Age games, and we got fewer of them as a consequence. It's hard not to talk ab…",

Whether you're doing quests for them, joining them, fighting them, or grinding reputation to get that one rare armour set you can't live without, factions are often key to your experience with a game. What would Skyrim be without inexplicably becoming the head of four different guilds? What would you do in Destiny if you didn't have a bunch of conveniently compartmentalised aliens to go shoot at? Would it even be possible to enjoy XCOM without a global coalition judging your performance after every mission? (Image credit: Bethesda) So, we've established that factions are important.

According to Paradox, Shadows of the Shroud offers a \"complete overhaul\" of Stellaris' Psionic Ascension path. Through this, your civilization taps its telepathic potential to commune with an extra-universal realm known as the Shroud, potentially forming a covenant with one of the cosmic divine beings—known as \"patrons\"—residing within. Shadows of the Shroud delineates this process into three key stages: preparing to pierce the veil, communing with the Patrons, then choosing one to ally with and reaping the rewards/suffering the consequences. As part of this, the DLC adds a new \"Shroud Panel\", helping visualise how attuned you are to the Shroud and specific patrons within it. This should make it easier to see precisely what path you're on, and the rewards (and risks) your chosen direction leads to.

Like a lot of things in the game, you're not explicitly told how to complete the quest. And if you don't figure it out, you'll have no way out of the area. This particular quest can be frustrating because there's a trick to it that you might only stumble upon by accident. The Seamstress isn't all that helpful when she asks you to find bugs that \"produce a marvelous spine, flexible yet strong.\" I don't know about you, but I've already found quite a lot of spine-like things in the game that are flexible and strong. It would've saved me a lot of time if the Seamstress, I don't know, narrowed it down a little. Turns out, there's one particular type of enemy that drops the Spine Cores you need to finish her quest. They're called Hokers and you've probably passed by a few in the area. They're round little guys who spit out spikes when you hit them. There are a bunch of them just to the right of the Seamstress' hut. All you have to do is slash them once, wait for them to shoot their spines out, and then hit each spine to pick them up as Spine Cores. …",

Mouselook or dual analogue control mods can sometimes make a classic more approachable, but other times it's like you used AI to \"improve\" the Mona Lisa or something. Caput Mortum gets this, and makes the controls one of your primary enemies, elevating a pretty good horror game to a truly memorable one.

When Musk rails against 'the establishment', it's only when it threatens his vast fortune, his ability to indulge in hate speech, or when he's promoting conspiracies. Indeed, he posted multiple tweets during the Covid-19 lockdowns where he drew connections between essential measures to protect the vulnerable and the plot of Deux Ex, where a man-made pandemic is deployed by the world's richest man to advance a political power play. Unsurprisingly, Austin Grossman, who wrote Deus Ex alongside Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, is not a fan of Musk's take on the classic cyberpunk immersive sim. Deus Ex—and Dishonored, which Grossman also wrote—is a game very much interested in the powerful, and the tools they use to control people.

You can undertake The Lost Fleas quest from Fleamaster Mooshka in The Marrow, shortly after you leave Bone Bottom. All five fleas are located in areas before Greymoor and the higher areas of Pharloom, so here I'll run through all of their locations and what you'll get once you return them safely to the flea caravan.

In contemporary or near-future games, though, it can be more problematic, as former Call of Duty director Glen Schofield realised when he was promoting the first incarnation of Modern Warfare 3 . \"I was doing 30 days of press for Modern Warfare 3,\" he tells us during a wide-ranging chat about his history with the series. \"I'm all over the world, and the last stop is in the UK, and I'm having dinner with some journalists from the UK and I get a call.

They're like, 'Don't worry, we'll have a bodyguard with you.' And I'm like, 'I don't feel any better.' And so I was a little worried about that aspect.

The speedrunning community is already at it (via Eurogamer ) with Silksong, rapidly uncovering a myriad of techniques that we'll all one day gawp at during an upcoming Awesome Games Done Quick. It's cool as hell, but I will never have the manual dexterity or mental energy to use any of these tactics. The work is taking place anywhere two or more Silksong fans are gathered, of course, but (oddly enough) you can get a great overview of the Silksong speedrunning community's work in the speedrunning channel on the Hollow Knight Discord and in the Hollow Knight Speedrun and Racing Community. So far, the mad lads have uncovered strats to travel at faster-than-sprinting speeds by combining jumping and sprinting, access ability-gated areas early by cunningly bouncing off well-placed flying enemies , and figured out you can just jump off spikes , I guess. That last one feels like it might get patched, but who knows? These early days are anarchy. My favourite, though, is this method for just absolutely clowning on poor Moorwing, t…",

And the good news is that the entry requirements to a world of obsessing over stats are so low that your grandmother's bargain bin laptop will probably be fine. Football Manager 26's Steam entry has just appeared, barely a month after publisher Sega first announced it and roughly seven months after the shocking cancellation of Football Manager 25 . Along with a first-look video of what to expect, the Steam listing also includes two sets of PC system requirements, the usual 'minimum' and 'recommended'. The Football Manager series has a long history of running fine on basic PCs, though the switch to using Unity as the game engine for FM 26 might lead you to think that something more potent would be needed. Well, you've got absolutely no worries on that count.

    "body": "Beating the Fourth Chorus in Hollow Knight: Silksong requires you to put on your thinking cap, though admittedly only at a jaunty angle. This is the first boss you'll face in Silksong that actually has a bit of a gimmick, and you'll have to do something very specific to conclude the fight. It doesn't help that he constantly smashes the platform you're standing on so you fall into the lava. If you haven't reached this point yet or got the Drifter's Cloak, you'll need to find some Hokers before you can escape the Far Fields. You'll actually need that upgrade in this fight, plus it's the only way you can reach this boss on the way out of the area anyway.

It's also kind of urgent, as you're basically trapped in the areas near her until you do, since she crafts you the item you need to use on the wind pillars to float your way out of the hole. You need to gather 25 Spine Cores from these creatures, but unlike gathering the pilgrim shawls for Bone Bottom, these items don't simply drop from killing them—there's a special trick to farming the item. All that said, here's where to find Hokers and how to gather Spine Cores in Silksong.

Fortunately, the Cult of the Lamb social media pages have been drip-feeding information to us about the size of the DLC in comparison to the first game, how it ended up getting slightly out of hand, and why the devs have chosen to release a paid update rather than another free one. According to a TikTok posted by Cult of the Lamb , the DLC will be \"almost as long as the original game\" for no other reason than \"we flew a little too close to the sun here. We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates. This DLC is not free, but I promise you'll love it.\" They're not wrong, either. If there's one game I know I can rely on when it comes to crazy marketing, it would be Cult of the Lamb. Though, despite the promise of another hefty adventure as a cult leader, the fact the DLC is paid is what is confusing a significant number of players. Cult of the Lamb has been incredibly generous in supplying us with free content updates over the last three years, be it the addition of co-op …",
