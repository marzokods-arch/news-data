    "body": "Take a Message Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is disabling Take a Message on some Pixel phones after reports that it could expose background audio during missed calls. The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

But while Ozzy was the face of those innovations, the creative force behind the blueprints was his wife of 43 years, Sharon Osbourne — a supremely talented music executive in her own right who’s not yet done changing the industry. “All of the creative direction for visuals at Ozzfest was mine. I can’t sing a note — I’m tone-deaf — but I can be creative, and I like to create things,” Osbourne, 73, reminisced in December from a hotel room on New York’s Upper East Side, perfectly coiffed and sipping tea after a late night out at a star-studded private rock show at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, N.Y., that featured Slash, Eddie Vedder, Anthony Kiedis, Yungblud and Bruno Mars, among others. “I’ve been talking to Live Nation about bringing [Ozzfest] back recently,” she continues. “It was something Ozzy was very passionate about: giving yo…",

Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

Galaxy users will be able to apply the new privacy protection only to specific apps, automatically shield PINs and other sensitive inputs, limit what’s visible in notification pop-ups, and more. After several leaks and a previous slip-up inside One UI, Samsung has now officially detailed what it calls “a new Galaxy privacy layer,” and it lines up almost perfectly with the rumored Privacy Display feature for the Galaxy S26 series .",

Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

Amid a recent blitz of Galaxy S26 rumors and leaks, we’ve heard about color options a couple of times: first in the context of leaked images of the S26 Ultra’s SIM card tray , then in a second rumor that corroborated the colors from that initial leak while claiming the existence of two more. Today, though, we’ve got a conflicting report that lines up with the SIM card tray leak, but doesn’t mention the other colorways we heard about later. Leaker theonecid posted on Twitter today that the Galaxy S26 series will come in four colors: black, white, Cobalt Violet, and Sky Blue. Those are the same colors seen in images of the Ultra model’s SIM tray posted earlier this month by Ice Universe — but today’s post notably lacks the “silver shadow” and “pink gold” colorways leaker Evan Blass claimed would be available on the S26 Ultra last week.",

The TriFold is essentially a large Android tablet that fits in your pocket, and it may be the perfect device if you fancy using three apps side-by-side. And if you’re in the US and have been waiting to lay your hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, we have good news. As promised , Samsung is officially bringing the Galaxy Z TriFold to the US, and eager customers will be able to buy it starting Friday, January 30. The pricing for the Galaxy Z TriFold with 512GB storage is set at $2,899, and it will be available through Samsung’s online and offline retail stores.

While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access.

The A57 could be just 6.9mm thick, matching rumored Galaxy S26 dimensions. TENAA photos show the same vertical camera layout and Key Island buttons, now paired with what appears to be a metal frame. Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

When Google first rolled out its AI photo-to-video tools in Google Photos, the idea was nice, but the execution could feel a little hit-or-miss. You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.
