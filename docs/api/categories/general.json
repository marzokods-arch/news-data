Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release.

For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset .

The new tweak allows users to edit actions within the Gemini app, including the prompt, the name of the action, and the run conditions. Previously, users would be required to visit the web portal to administer any tweaks. Google rolled out Scheduled Actions for Gemini in June, allowing users to trigger tasks at a specific time of the day automatically. This was a boon for those who create daily digests and want them to run without intervention. However, there was one small problem: these actions were a nightmare to edit. Thanks to a small but significant change, Google is making it much easier to edit Scheduled Actions directly from the Gemini app.",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels.

Specs include an LED light source, 1080p resolution, 500 ANSI lumens, HDR10/HLG support, and built-in Google TV and Netflix. The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",

    "body": "Yesterday was a big day for Google Home. In fact, I may go as far as to say it was one of the most critical moments for the platform in years. Between the long-awaited Gemini rollout , redesigned Home app , new Nest cameras , and really impressive Ask Home capabilities , Google’s smart home ambitions have never looked brighter. However, for everything Google seems to have gotten right with this next chapter of Google Home, there’s one area that still feels noticeably lacking: hardware. Specifically, smart speaker and smart display hardware.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is set to bring partial screen recording to its devices with One UI 8.5. The feature will allow recording only a section of the screen along with sounds. Samsung currently allows partial recording, but the results are saved as GIFs and not videos. Samsung’s rollout of One UI 8 is catching up in pace. While it is much more timely compared to its laggard One UI 7 rollout, it feels like a mere version upgrade with few changes. However, to ensure we have no complaints, it is also working on a significant update with One UI 8.5, which is expected to arrive with the Galaxy S26 series in the coming months. We’ve already spotted nearly a dozen new features in One UI 8.5 and are learning about a quite useful addition. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could introduce partial screen recording, which would allow only a selected portion of the display to be captured and displayed in the video. The feature was spotted in a leaked One UI 8.5 test build and reported by leaker Ice Universe on Weibo .",

    "body": "TL;DR At its fall event, Amazon announced two new Kindle features: Story So Far and Ask This Book. Both use AI, providing spoiler-safe recaps and context-aware answers. The features will launch on Kindle iOS later in 2025 and on Kindle devices in early 2026. True to trend, the Kindle platform is getting another dose of generative AI. Alongside the newest Kindle Scribe lineup launched at its fall hardware event, Amazon announced two new reading tools: Story So Far and Ask This Book. Both aim to make reading more interactive while sparing users from spoilers. Story So Far acts like a spoiler-safe highlight reel. Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience. The tool will allow users to highlight passages and ask context-aware questions, such as “What’s the significance of this scene?” Amazon says the system will answer based only on the text read so far, helping with comprehension without spoiling future plot poin…",
