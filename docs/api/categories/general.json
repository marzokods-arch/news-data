    "body": "Gavin Adcock released his first songs back in 2021, but over the past year, he&#8217;s hit a new career high, thanks to his album Own Worst Enemy . The August-released set debuted at No. 4 on Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart and at No. 14 on the all-genre Billboard 200 . Adcock also earned a string of RIAA gold and platinum-certified songs this year. But beyond music accolades, the Warner Music Nashville-signed Adcock has been in plenty of headlines, for reasons outside of music. He was arrested in May in Wilson County, Tennessee, on charges including reckless driving and an open container violation (he was released and the charges were later dismissed ). He played off the arrest by later releasing the song &#8220;Morning Bail.&#8221; But he also has a penchant for seemingly beefing with several people, from fellow artists to a concert sound technician. Adcock has stirred up controversy for expressing his views on Beyoncé&#8217;s Cowboy Carter album, calling out Zach Bryan in an incident involving a fan autograph, and engaging in an ongoing back-and-forth beef with country/Americana artist Charley Crockett. In his recent interview with Billboard , Adcock discussed his p…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is making support for its Themed Icons feature mandatory by automatically generating themed icons for apps that don’t already provide one. This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out. Not only does the lack of contrast look bad, but it also makes it difficult to read any white text in the window.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max provides more transparent marketing than most other fast chargers. The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

The iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the list, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Xiaomi Redmi 14C 4G also made appearances. Apple and Samsung tend to dominate the list of most popular smartphones each quarter. Now, Counterpoint Research has announced the top ten best-selling phones of Q2 2025, and it’s mostly business as usual. Counterpoint Research revealed that iPhone 16 series handsets were the top three most popular smartphones in Q2 2025 . The iPhone 16 was at the top, followed by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and then the iPhone 16 Pro. Curiously, the iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the top ten list. So we can perhaps see why the company changed tack and launched the iPhone Air last week.",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

Google quickly confirmed the problem, and this week reports that a fix is available to those running Android Auto 15. Despite that news, quite a few Pixel 10 owners share that their problems with Android Auto have yet to resolve. If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Reports are coming in about an audio skipping issue with wireless Android Auto. The bug may be linked to a recent update to Google Maps and Waze. Users are switching to Bluetooth streaming to fix the problem. Although Android Auto is great, it isn’t without its faults. Getting the smart driving companion to work consistently can sometimes be an effort in futility. For example, users recently discovered an issue where Pixel 10 devices would cause Android Auto to freeze . Thankfully, Google has now implemented a fix with the most recent update. However, there’s a new annoying problem on the horizon that’s affecting audio playback. Multiple reports are coming in from Reddit about a bug that’s causing music to stutter and skip when connected to Android Auto wirelessly. The issue looks to be happening regardless of the user’s phone brand. It appears the problem may be connected to Google Maps and Waze.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s smallest Galaxy S26 phones could stick with 25W charging for another year. Early Galaxy S26 Ultra rumors suggested the phone may charge faster than 45W. Now regulatory filings suggest that Samsung will keep the Ultra at 45W again. For a whole lot of smartphone shoppers, power is the name of the game. And we’re not talking performance, either, like how high you can get those benchmark figures, but electrical power: how much charge your phone holds, and how quick and easy it is to get it recharged. Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles . But there are still plenty of other power issues we’d like to see improved, and rumors have already suggested a few places whe…",

The description confirms the “Galaxy XR” branding for Samsung’s XR headset. It also confirms that Samsung phones will be able to shoot 3D/spatial images and videos for viewing on the Galaxy XR headset. Samsung teamed up with Google for its Project Moohan headset on the brand-new Android XR platform. Samsung is said to be gearing up to launch the headset very soon , either by the end of this month or the next, depending on which leak you believe. Samsung has now accidentally disclosed that the Project Moohan headset will be called “Galaxy XR,” and that users will be shoot spatial images and videos on their phones to view it on the headset, just like they can on newer iPhones and the Apple Vision Pro. Sammobile reports that a new version of the Camera Assistant app (v4.0.0.3) is available on the Galaxy S25 FE but not yet on other Galaxy devices.

This toggle controls whether the mouse cursor can move between screens when it reaches the edge, preventing accidental screen-hopping. Found in the first QPR2 beta, this small but welcome change gives users more control over Android’s DeX-like desktop experience. One of the most exciting features in Android 16 QPR1 is its new DeX-like desktop experience, which activates when you connect a compatible Pixel device to an external display. This desktop mode provides a taskbar and freeform window management on the external monitor while leaving your phone’s screen free for other tasks. When you connect a mouse, you can seamlessly move the cursor between displays to control both screens with the same peripheral. Currently, there’s no way to disable this seamless mouse movement, but that’s set to change in the next quarterly Android release.
