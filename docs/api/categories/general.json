It arrives December 3 and the early signs are very positive: Blizzard may well have dragged its feet over adding a feature that much of the competition already has but, as PCG's Harvey Randall points out, it's also been able to learn from two decades of others' mistakes . Needless to say, part of this new housing system is furniture. When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

They just do their thing and we rarely give them a moment's thought, until they ruin a Steam download, of course. I felt very much the same way until I recently reviewed three new devices from TP-Link: two mesh systems, the Deco BE68 and Deco BE25 BE5000 , and the Archer BE9700 . Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router. Heck, you can't even buy a brand-new, semi-decent graphics card for that amount of money. As someone who's only ever used the router s…",

The error was spotted by eagle-eyed market watchers on Etherscan, a block explorer and analytics platform, and was said to be fixed within 20 minutes (via CNBC ). The company released a statement on X confirming the erroneous minting of coins, describing it as an internal technical error. \"There is no security breach,\" the post continues. \"Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause.\" What that root cause was, we may never know. I like to imagine it might have been someone dropping a sandwich on their keyboard, because that's often how my mistakes are made.

    "body": "The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is a handheld gaming PC that is filled with, and fills me with, contradictions. 'This is an Xbox,' cries Microsoft of what is patently just a PC. 'This is the best handheld gaming PC I've ever used,' I cry of a device that I could not in good conscience recommend anyone with budgetary constraints should buy. Such is the folly of the redesigned and rebadged Asus ROG Ally X . A handheld gaming PC that goes a long way to ironing out many of the kinks inherent in Windows-based devices, but does so with what I believe is a fundamental misunderstanding of why people buy handhelds in the first place. At its heart, it's a new version of the Asus handheld, but with a new AMD APU inside and a reskinned, reimagined version of Windows on top. And both are improvements over what's gone before. But Microsoft, having ditched its own plans for an in-house handheld, has slapped an Xbox badge on it and is now asking gamers to pay far more than they have for any Xbox console that has ever existed. This is the Xbox Ally X: An Xbox that isn't, and a handheld PC that's kinda got it right, but also kinda wrong. Asus ROG Xbox Ally X - our verdict (Image credit: Future) Valve's St…",

This move was immediately greeted by an unprecedented surge of angry chatter. Honestly, I was quite shocked at just how quickly the community rallied on a random Wednesday to voice their concerns. The lesson here is: don't mess with Battlefield's traditional mode, or you'll be met with pitchforks. After all, people complaining about Conquest matches ending due to the time expiring and not down-to-the-wire battles of attrition weren't annoyed by the tickets; they were annoyed by the timer . Announced just after promising overhauls to Battlefield 6's currently slow progression systems, Battlefield Studios has confirmed its reverting the controversial ticket change: \"We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds.\" This was followed…",

YouTuber RandomGaminginHD has put the AMD Radeon RX 570 to the test in Battlefield 6, and the 2017 graphics card holds up surprisingly well (via PCMR subreddit ). Surprisingly well, that is, compared to just not working at all or being entirely unplayable, which is what I would have expected for such an old card in most modern, good-looking games. We do, the YouTuber explains, need to make \"some pretty big visual sacrifices\" to achieve a relatively solid 60 fps. To my eyes, though, those visual sacrifices aren't ones that make the game unplayable. They essentially mean dropping the resolution down low, which will, of course, make the game look quite jagged and pixelated, but even on the lowest settings, the actual visuals, such as textures, still seem to look half-decent. The AMD Radeon RX 570 has just 4 GB of VRAM, but Battlefield 6 doesn't use more than this when it's set to the lowest settings at 1080p.

A point-and-click adventure based on Harlan Ellison's novel about a group of humans subjected to eternal torment by a misanthropic AI, voiced in the game by Ellison himself, I Have No Mouth has become a bit of a cult classic since its release in 1995. This is Nightdive's first patch for it since 2018, and the patch notes are actually pretty few. That doesn't mean they're not significant, though. In essence, the patch updates the PC version of the game to match the console editions released in March this year. That means navigable menus, improved controller support, and in general an experience more suited to 2025 than 1995. It feels good!

Thankfully, Battlefield Studios has answered our calls and is implementing a number of substantial changes to quicken the pace of progression: \"Our goals here are to make the progression experience feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon.\" These changes were originally signalled to go live within the next week, but are surprisingly already being implemented across all platforms.

Basically, unlike most Wi-Fi 7 routers and mesh networks, the Deco BE25 doesn't support the 6 GHz band or the 320 MHz channel. You just get 2.4 and 5 GHz, plus a maximum 240 MHz channel, making it not better than an average Wi-Fi 6 system.

Have poor Wi-Fi in your basement or attic bedroom? Then a mesh setup is ideal for you. However, most systems seem to be extremely expensive, and that's certainly true for the high-end models.

    "body": "If you've just bought a new gaming PC or upgraded your current one to an AMD Ryzen 9000-series or Intel Core Ultra 200S setup, there's a good chance you'll be considering an upgrade to your Internet router, too. That's all because such rigs sport ultra-fast Wi-Fi 7 adapters, and if you've got a web connection that's 1 Gbps or faster, you'll surely be wanting to enjoy some mighty quick Steam downloads, if your home is wirelessly networked. What's probably stopping you is the price of a typical Wi-Fi 7 router: Netgear's Nighthawk RS600 is $400, and even its slower RS300 model is $329, while Asus is asking $350 for its RT-BE88U , and that doesn't support the full Wi-Fi 7 feature list. So if I tell you that the TP-Link Archer BE9700 has every Wi-Fi 7 trick in the book, five fast LAN ports, an easy-to-use interface, and costs just $200 , does that make you change your mind? It certainly made me pause for thought and wonder if we have a new contender for the best gaming router you can buy right now. Jumping the gun somewhat, I have to say now that the Archer BE9700 isn't the outright best one around, as it's nowhere near as fast as most of the top-end routers on the market, and it's not…",

    "body": "Home mesh systems might sound like a whole new world of wireless technology, but they're really just two or more 'routers' that can transfer data between themselves, allowing for a greater wireless coverage in your house. I say 'routers' because that's just one part of what's inside: you've also got a WAP (wireless access point) and a network switch. But regardless of what you call the TP-Link Deco BE68 BE14000, you're getting a very capable device for providing super-fast Wi-Fi 7 in every nook and cranny of your home. You can buy the system as a two or three-pack, and even just use a single unit (or node, to use the correct term), but we're reviewing the $700 triple node offering here. TP-Link claims up to 8,100 square feet (753 square metres) of coverage with three nodes (6,000 for two and 3,100 for one), which far exceeds the dimensions of a typical home, be it in the UK or the USA. However, if you have a large property with buildings widely separated, that 8,100 square feet of coverage might come in very handy. The Deco BE68 sits roughly in the middle of TP-Link's Wi-Fi 7 home mesh range due to its maximum speed rating of BE14000. That number refers to the peak data transfer s…",

Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game.

A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet.

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

That's about to change: On November 3, Dwarf Fortress gets its awaited Siege update, and a lot of dwarves are going to be a lot less safe. While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field. In a brief preview video , Dwarf Fortress creator Tarn Adams outlined the new siegecraft tactics invaders will employ to break apart and circumvent fortress defenses, forcing players to rethink years of defensive strategy.

    "body": "Tomonobu Itagaki has died at the age of 58 following a serious illness. Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

An EU committee—the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee—today adopted a report by popular vote that encourages the European Commission (EC) to tackle several harms that minors face online today. The vote to adopt the report passed with \"32 votes in favour, 5 against and with 9 abstentions\". And in addition to proposing a minimum age of 13 for kids to access social media with parental permission, or age 16 without that permission, and some other recommendations, the committee also recommends a loot box ban.

Most of your rank and file allies have everyday Tactics jobs to earn enough to feed their families fresh Chocobo drumsticks. Over my decades of obsession with this king of strategy RPGs I’ve created a highly scientific system to compare and contrast each and every job across four critical axes: Style : Any dummy can swing a sword, but I need more than that, I need fashion sense . How color coordinated is the job, and does their fit have real chutzpah, or did their mom dress them right out of the fantasy Gap?
