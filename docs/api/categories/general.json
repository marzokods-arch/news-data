It's, I don't know, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sleepless in Seattle or something. All I know is that it's definitely not Bloodlines, and slapping that name on The Chinese Room's game was a mistake. (Image credit: The Chinese Room) More than a mistake, it was a disservice to the game itself. Here's the thing: I very much enjoyed Bloodlines 2. It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately. It's a great Vampire game, but not a great Bloodlines game, and that latter name only ever detracts from the game we ended up getting 21 years after an RPG that people are still replaying today.

My 8BitDo Retro R8 isn't as competitively viable as the Logitech I swapped it out for, but it is more convenient. The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room. It comes with a compartment underneath to plug in a 2.4 GHz dongle, which means, if you plug the dock into your PC, it will both charge your controller and work as your connector.

Given each game has 87 bazillion guns (give or take a bazillion), shields and mods to loot, Gearbox likes to sneak in a few dashes of joke sauce to its equipment soup. The bit this time? The shield doms you. You take damage or do anything, and the Cindershelly will let you know that you're subhuman scum. Here are a couple of sample lines, courtesy of our poor put-upon guides writer, Rory Norris, who had some things to say about it last month : \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" \"Did you let go without asking first?\" \"Don't stop till I allow it\" \"Worship me\" \"Show me how close you can get, worm\" \"What an obedient worm you are\" As Rory explained, the shield was very chatty.

It's an angular set of speakers, with see through panels on the side to blast RGB light into your eyeballs. It feels very 2000s to me, in a way I haven't experienced with any of the speakers I've tested over the last few years. With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking. However, it can also be kind of annoying, as that colour is very bright and pulsing. Holding down the G button on the right-hand side turns o…",

I'll admit, I wasn't expecting too much from Borderlands 4 's Halloween event. After all, it's a free, two-week affair simply made to inject some light-hearted festivity into Kairos before it vanishes for a year. And yet, somehow, I'm still left wondering what the point of it all even is. If you're yet to play it, I'll save you the effort: the Borderlands 4 Horrors of Kairos event is just the usual Rift Champion 'boss bubble' world events, but the sky is red (yes, this is the promised \"new seasonal weather variant\"). Oh, and there's a chance to get two new items, the Murmur assault rifle and the Skully grenade, both of which are pretty terrible. In fact, the Skully is so abysmally weak that I'm convinced it's just bugged.

Everything inevitably becomes Balatro. Slot machines are a Balatro. Mahjong is a Balatro. Chess is a Balatro. And now, thanks to a prototype game from solo developer BadIdeasDigital, the bouncing DVD logo screensaver of our youth is a Balatro, too. (Image credit: BadIdeasDigital) By the grace of the international DVD Consortium, the early 2000s were blessed with by the bouncing DVD logo, a screensaver that could be found in countless American living rooms where entranced viewers were compelled by the hypnotic promise of watching the logo bounce perfectly into one of the screen's corners—perhaps so perfectly that it might at last end its interminable ricochet and thus grant us a singular peace. Sadly, that's not how it works, and you won't find that peace in DVD Bounce World . But you will find a Balatro-like combo-based roguelike, where the DVD logo's bounces—here, a finite amount—contribute to an escalating score threshold that you have to meet within a certain number of turns.

But this time it \"just kind of felt right,\" Roberts says. In the Keepers of the Flame expansion, which arrives on October 31, PoE will return to Breach, a nine-year-old mechanic that is basically about killing monsters in a circle until time runs out. The simplicity of Breach will stay. Roberts stresses that the team wanted to be extremely careful about adding unnecessary complexity that might alienate its long-time fans. It will still involve touching a creepy hand and killing monsters inside of an expanding circle, but those monsters will have improved behavior thanks to tech that was worked on for the last Path of Exile 2 patch . And now there will be \"unstable\" breaches which call in a new boss to cap off the event.

Duckov's got a surprising amount of depth under that parody appearance. Duckov developer Team Soda, a studio owned by China's Bilibili media platform, isn't resting easy on its laurels: Less than 24 hours after announcing its 1 million sales milestone, Team Soda has pushed a new update with a smattering of new features, balance adjustments, and bugfixes. Most of the changes are fairly mundane. Orange headphones can now be dismantled for materials; there's a new UI indicator for when the player's injured; dogs are now more of an early game terror thanks to their footsteps being silenced.

Thanks to new reporting from Bloomberg , we now have a clearer idea of the motivation for Microsoft's current gaming strategy—if it can be called that. According to sources familiar with the business, Microsoft executives have been pressuring the Xbox division to achieve profit margins well in excess of industry average. Bloomberg reports that in fall of 2023, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood introduced a new target of 30% \"accountability margins\"—Microsoft's corporate euphemism of choice for profit margins—for the gaming division. In comparison, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that profit margins in the games industry have fallen from a recent height of 22% during the COVID lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 to an average of 17% in 2024. In other words, Microsoft executives have been expecting the Xbox divisio…",

Per analyst firm Circana (via Gamesindustry.biz ), Borderlands 4 has Gearbox counting stacks for the foreseeable future: It was the number one US best-seller for the month of September (August 31 to October 3, to be specific). Not just that, but it's sold 30% more than Borderlands 3's debut, and stands as the fastest-selling game in the franchise's history. Exactly how many stacks is a different ballgame. Borderlands 4, according to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, had more than twice the budget of Borderlands 3 (assuming he wasn't just being hyperbolic, which is always possible ). Whether or not these nippy sales are enough to categorise it as an unmitigated success for Pitchford are entirely dependent on what his studio's goals are. Also raising eyebrows are the fact that Borderlands 4 went on sale earlier this month. Past the cutoff point for Circana's data, mind, but given Pitchford's past words warn…",
