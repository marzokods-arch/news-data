Now a tipster is sharing a vague hint that might point to a possible commercial release. Cameras need space. Manufacturers have done an utterly remarkable job creating some incredibly compact lens-and-sensor assemblies — so much so that for the vast majority of us, our phones are now our primary cameras — but when you really want to go above and beyond with features and image quality, that means growing past the confines of our phones. One way a number of brands have been doing that is through add-on lenses , but last last year, one phone company teased an even more impressive add-on — and it could soon be ready to make its commercial debut.

That sentiment, punctuated by deep musicality, came across loud and clear more than six months ago, when Billboard traveled to Puerto Rico to interview Bunny as he wound down his epic 30-day residency at Coliseo de Puerto Rico. The ensuing cover story told the story behind the making of Debí Tirar Más Fotos and Bunny&#8217;s residency. At the time, Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show hadn’t been announced, nor had he yet garnered multiple Grammy nominations for his phenomenally successful album. But the spirit behind the album, the intent to highlight the island and its culture and music, and, perhaps most telling, the intent to highlight regional identity in an increasingly global environment, were very clear.

    "body": "The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is widely tipped to launch at the end of the month, but leaks suggest that the cheapest model will get mostly iterative upgrades. That’s bad news for those who want a flagship Galaxy without spending Ultra money. The cheaper Galaxy A56 5G isn’t a better option, either, as it gains a larger battery but loses out on performance, flexible cameras, wireless charging, and more. However, colleague Andrew Grush recently got his daughter a Galaxy S25 FE and subsequently wondered why he bothered with flagships. Between this article and my own time with the phone last year, I realized that the Galaxy S25 FE is actually Samsung’s best-kept secret today.",

I do have some serious complaints, though. My biggest issue is the lack of ports, but I also found that it requires a factory reset every year or two due to significant performance problems. Acer announced the Acer 4K UHD Google TV Streaming Box in South Africa late last year, and this looked like the answer to my prayers. This Google TV box is made by prominent ODM SEI Robotics, but a closer look revealed that it easily met my requirement for more ports. This theoretically means I can plug in my portable hard drive for no-frills local media playback, or easily plug in a flash drive to transfer APKs. I recently splashed out on the Acer TV box and, after using it for roughly six weeks, here are my thoughts on making the switch.",

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears.

TL;DR Google is updating Pixel’s vague Adaptive Connectivity with clearer controls in Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2. There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR YouTube TV and Disney reached a distribution agreement in November, ending a multi-week blackout of Disney content on the platform. A new report now reveals how big a financial hit Disney’s sports broadcasting arm suffered due to the blackout. ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But last year, Android users found themselves scratching their heads about one change in particular: Google’s Phone app adding support for a landscape-style interface . Was it a bug?

It has a new cross-emulator save management feature and an integrated mod downloader. These major features are PC-only for now, but all platforms have updates and bug fixes. It’s only been a week since Eden improved Nintendo Switch emulation on Android in its latest update, but now the other major alternative has pushed brand new features to PC. Citron’s “Pathfinder” update dropped over the weekend, and although it’s mostly focused on PC and Steam Deck performance, it has bug fixes and updates across all platforms. One of the biggest and most unique new features in the update is save management. This allows you to choose where your save games live, back them up, import them, and even use them in other Switch emulators like Eden or old-school Yuzu. This can be set globally or on a per-game basis.",

Google is also testing the option to generate 4K images using Gemini. There’s no doubting that Gemini is the most important product for Google. Google is therefore continuing to drop new features in Gemini to entice users, and is now testing three new features. But in addition to adding new features for users, Google may also be looking to simply replace another chatbot with Gemini. Out of the features Google is currently testing in Gemini, the most compelling appears to be the ability to import chats from other AI chatbots while retaining all information and media shared in those chats. Alexey Shabanov of TestingCatalog has discovered a new “Import AI Chats” option in Gemini’s attachment menu. As expected, this solution is geared towards helping users switch from competing platforms, such as ChatGPT , Claude, or Microsoft Copilot.",

In fact, it’s much more locked down than the Kindle Fire tablets that allow you to sideload regular Android apps. The Echo line doesn’t enjoy that privilege. But thanks to a new open-source project, you can now jailbreak select Echo Show 5 and Show 8 models and replace Amazon’s locked-down Fire OS with full-fledged Android. Under the hood, Amazon’s smart displays pack similar specifications as mainstream Android devices. For instance, the second-gen Show 5 relied on MediaTek’s MT8163 chip, which also powered the Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and several budget phones like the Nokia 5.1. However, Amazon has never permitted unlocking the bootloader on its smart displays, keeping us locked to the Alexa-centric Fire OS ecosystem.",
