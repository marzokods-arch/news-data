The app fails to launch because it can’t find a font that’s only provided through Google Play Services. Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up. We’ve since learned why that dependency exists, and the reason is surprisingly trivial.",

Users were unable to log in, creators lost their pre-launch efforts, and order numbers were shuffled. Existing campaigns also saw prices increase mid-campaign as exchange rates were recalculated. Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

    "summary": "It's $1,800 for the headset, but the accessories add another $500. What's your view on the price?",
    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Scrolling can be resumed at any time, and Shorts will still appear throughout the app while the main feed is paused. This timer is rolling out beginning today, but you may not have it just yet. Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google has added an audio source toggle to the Pixel line’s Connected Cameras feature. This means you can choose whether switching to a remote camera will also switch audio sources. This is great news, as we previously criticized this limitation after trying Connected Cameras earlier this year. Google revealed the Connected Cameras feature for Pixel phones earlier this year. This allows Pixel owners to use another Pixel or GoPro as an extra camera during live streams for more camera angles. There was one annoying audio limitation, though, but Google has finally addressed this. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

This news is covered in the video above starting at 06:40.

After all of this time, it’s hard to believe that Samsung first began teasing its extended reality (XR) headset — Galaxy XR — in early 2023.

Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way.",

This will allow users to switch from the default “Back, Home, Recents” layout to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout common on Samsung phones. The feature is live in the latest Android Canary build and may roll out to the public in the Android 16 QPR3 release. If you’ve grown accustomed to using the three-button navigation bar on a Samsung phone , then you might have a hard time switching to a Google phone . That’s because Samsung uses a different layout for its version of the three-button navigation bar. Instead of putting the back button on the left like on stock Android, Samsung puts the back button on the right. While Samsung does let you flip the order of these buttons to match stock Android’s layout, the opposite isn’t true. Stock Android doesn’t let you flip these buttons, so people switching from Samsung phones have to either retrain their muscle memory on the new button layout or switch to gesture navigation. To make it easier for Samsung users to switch to Pixel phones, Google is introducing a new Android setting that lets you reorder the buttons in the three-button naviga…",
