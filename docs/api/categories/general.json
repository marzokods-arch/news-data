(After all, it&#8217;s been No. 1 for 454 weeks out of the 528 it has been on the chart since its debut in 2015.) So when Hamilton is not No. 1 — as is the case this week — it&#8217;s notable. But the title that bumps Hamilton down to No. 2 this week is actually another album related to the show. A 10-song highlights edition, Hamilton: 10 Shots , arrives at No. 1 on the Nov. 15-dated chart , with 17,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending Nov. 6, according to Luminate.
