(Ok, we got Oblivion Remastered last year, but leftovers, however well warmed up, don't count). The Arthurian-flavoured open-world RPG recently surpassed one million copies sold, proving, if proof was ever needed, there's still a big hunger for Skyrim -style experiences. Tainted Grail kept players well fed over 2025 with a constant stream of patches, and Questline looks set to carry that momentum forward into 2026. With the release of Tainted Grail's latest patch , the developers revealed that a bigger update is coming in February, while a free DLC will be released to all players in March. Questline doesn't delve too deeply into the details for either set of plans, though it is slightly more forthcoming about the February update. This, apparently, will provide an \"extra pass mostly over act three, polishing many layers of the game\" including areas like level design and loot. This follows on from a similar patch last year that likewise polished …",

A whole new weapon was recently discovered in the 2006 open-world game, one that's been locked tantalisingly away from players for more than 20 years. Now though, players can get their grubby mitts on it thanks to a glitch discovered by a YouTuber. Said YouTuber is JustGarrison, who, in a zingy twist of irony, stumbled upon the glitch during a pacifist run of Bully. JustGarrison's plan to complete the game without fighting anyone ran smoothly until he encountered Norton, a boss players must defeat during the mission 'The Tenements'. It's here where JustGarrison inadvertently unlocked the weapon—a sledgehammer that was previously only usable during the boss fight. During the boss fight, Norton tries to bash Jimmy's head in with the sledgehammer. But once Norton is defeated, Jimmy can equip the sledgehammer and use it to retrieve some key quest items through the medium of smashing. That's all he can do with it, however. He cannot take it outside. Like Greyfriars Bobby , the weapon is destined to remain by the side of its fallen owner foreve…",

Project: Gorgon is an MMO that harks back to the primordial days of the genre, with simple 3D visuals and a minimally-guided levelling experience that lets you figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself (or with a party of pals, this being an MMO). But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat. Potential avenues to explore include a grapple-based unarmed combat system, necromancy that lets you rai…",

No, I'm not a hero, I'd just rather stare at a screen than do any real work. Iron Lung , if you haven't played it yourself, is a first-person horror sim where you're sealed inside a tiny submarine and submerged in an ocean of blood on an alien planet. Using minimalist controls, you steer your windowless sub around taking pictures of whatever is lurking in the bloody depths while getting progressively more scared and paranoid. It's a great game.

It's set on a tantalizingly weird ring world populated with grimy medieval Witcher NPC types who will have daily schedules⁠—and a procedural vengeance system if you wrong them. I had to stop playing 1v1 PvP in Armored Core 6 because it was a detriment to my health: The knife's edge, million miles an hour duels filled me with so much adrenaline I'd have trouble sleeping if I played too late in the evening. Other games⁠—and for a few minutes right after playing, real life⁠—would feel so slow I had trouble adjusting. The new demo for indie RPG Sword Hero made me feel the same exhilaration and \"nothing can compare\" spoiling, but in singleplayer. Videogame combat so good, it might be a problem. To my editor reading this: I promise I got work done yesterday, but when I sat down for Sword Hero's updated Tournament demo for \"just a few rounds to see what's new,\" it became the rest of my work day and much of my evening.

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically. Although developers can sell DLC on other platforms and have it carry over to a user's Steam copy, Valve doesn't allow them to sell add-ons directly through in-game stores or to use th…",

    "body": "There's a new version of Final Fantasy 7 coming to Steam to take the place of the 2013 release, and everyone who owns the original can have it for free—and even better, they'll continue to have access to the old edition, too. You might be curious what's new in this new version, or when it will be out, and I'm sorry to say I can't help. A message posted to the Final Fantasy 7 account on X says \"the original Final Fantasy 7 will be re‑released on Steam to provide an improved gameplay experience,\" and directs readers to an announcement on Steam for \"full details.\" And there definitely are more details, although calling it \"full\" is a stretch. The existing game will be renamed to Final Fantasy 7 - 2013 Edition when the new version launches. Existing owners will have access to both versions, but the original will no longer be available for purchase. Save data will not be compatible: 2013 saves won't work in the new release, and vice versa, so if you want to jump into the new one you'll be starting from scratch. And... that's it. What's changed? When is the update coming? Is the price going up? How's this going to muck up mod support? Why is Square Enix horsing around with a 13-year-old…",

Absolum is a brilliantly clever hybrid of classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up combat with a roguelike framework, and I'm not sure it ever quite got the buzz it deserved. It seems like it found an audience, at least, with 500,000 players , a 94% positive rating on Steam and apparently enough success to fuel a new free update . Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Arriving on February 12, the 1.1 patch will make further tweaks and fixes, but more importantly add a raft of new content to give the experience even more replayability. \"Mystic Ordeals\" are customisable modifiers you can apply to runs after you've beaten the final boss, so you can keep testing your skills. And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process. The update's also adding elite mounts—rarer versions with upgraded attacks—as well as new emotes for co-op play and unlockable character skins. …",

Luckily, MagMell Island is free for you to explore, so you can almost immediately grab the best early weapons and be on your merry way. I've played around with a few weapons so far, but these are undoubtedly my favourites. VK Dual Blades (Image credit: Bandai Namco) You can buy the VK Dual Blades from Jadwiga's Minion merchant on the southwest coast of MagMell Island for 1,000 Haze The VK Dual Blades is the best weapon I've found at the start of the game, in part because it synergises perfectly with Noah's blood code, which boosts Dexterity and damage with successive hits. You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too. These daggers come with Shredding Spin to deal massive damage, though it eats through your ichor. It also has the Iron Will skill, which temporarily reduces all incoming damage.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",
