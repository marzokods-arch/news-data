No Steam Deck: Verified Link: Official site This is just The Seance of Blake Manor's way of saying hello before leaving me trapped inside a remote Irish hotel with a bunch of weirdos and would-be murderers a few days before Halloween. I'm here to solve the disappearance of Evelyn Deane, a woman the hotel manager insists isn't missing at all and most of the guests have a strong, and often not particularly positive, opinion of. To do this I've got to cautiously listen at doors before sneaking inside using stolen keys, eavesdrop on conversations held in quiet corners, and piece this puzzle together using clues found amongst crumpled up letters, half-burnt notes, and polite conversations at dinner. This is classic murder mystery stuff—and also where adventure games can quickly lose grip of their own plot. But The Seance of Blake Man…",

Demonstrating his utter wrongness yet again is the Emulated Vintage Gaming YouTube channel, which recently posted a 10 hour long video of a lore-accurate recreation of Frodo's epic journey from Bag End to Mordor in Lord of the Rings Online . 'Frodo walks from the Shire to Mordor,' as it's called, is not as dramatic or exciting as Peter Jackson's famed film trilogy: It is literally a recording of Frodo walking— walking , take note, not running, although he does get to ride here and there when the books say so—along the route originally followed by the Fellowship. At various spots along the way, Andy Serkis chimes in to describe the scene via audio clips taken from the Lord of the Rings audiobooks, which as chosen line up remarkably well with the events happening on screen. But even though it lacks the cinematic oomph of an Oscar-winning Hollywood film trilogy, the video is an undeniably impressive undertaking, and I dropped a line to EVG to ask what inspired him to do such a thing. \"Escapism, mainly,\" the channel owner, who asked to go unnamed, replied. \"Like anyone …",

Dwarves, meanwhile, received new toys to stem the tide of besieging goblins, like autocrossbow turret emplacements and metal-fortified walls. Overnight, the fantasy settlement sim has rewritten decades of player defensive strategy. One of the interesting complications added by the Siege Update, however, is an unintentional one. Shortly after the update went live, players started reporting on the Kitfox Games Discord that, inexplicably, dwarves in their forts were dying of starvation and dehydration. And not just any dwarves: The moms were refusing to eat, and their babies were the culprit. (Image credit: Kitfox Games) The problem, you see, is that moms are like horses—in Dwarf Fortress, at least. In DF, mothers always hold their newborn babies until the infants reach an age where they can walk, play, and feed themselves. To achieve that, the game actually uses the same systems that let soldiers ride war mounts: While we're shown a dwarven mo…",

But does Steam's dominance of the PC gaming market constitute a monopoly? Well, according to a new whitepaper, most game developers think so. Titled 'The State of PC Game Distribution' (via GamesIndustry ), the paper concludes that 72% of game developers believe the platform has a monopoly on the PC games market. The whitepaper was published by the digital distribution platform Rokky . If you're wondering \"who the heck is Rokky?\" then it's a new distribution platform that aims to connect publishers with various digital storefronts around the globe. The whitepaper was based on an independent study conducted by Atomik Research, which surveyed 306 executives in the UK and US between May 18 and May 22 this year.

The giveaway went live, winners were picked, and all was good. And then the game got delayed to May 2019. And then again to 2020. And then again to 2021. In a sign of remarkable foresight, Level-5 then skipped a year to delay the game into 2023. And then, uh, it got delayed into 2024 before being delayed into 2025. It actually got pushed back again earlier this year—twice, in fact—shifting the release from June to August, and finally to next month. With the November release date here to stay, Level-5 hasn't forgotten about those who were bestowed a copy in its giveaway all those years ago.

And if you've already picked up Firaxis' latest and most divisive entry in the series, you have the opportunity to pick up history's most notorious pirate entirely for free. Creative director Ed Beach provided an overview of update 1.3.0 in a developer video, starting with that civ-focussed balance pass. Exactly one dozen civilizations are getting a rework, namely Aksum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Songhai, Spain, and finally, Persia, which has been renamed slightly to differentiate it from a new DLC Civ. While the changes vary slightly between civs, the general thrust is the same. \"The majority of these adjustments are significant buffs aimed at strengthening these fan-favourite Civs,\" Beach explains. \"We're also introducing more specific bonuses to help each Civ lean into a unique playstyle.\" One example is that Egypt now receives \"tailored\" bonuses for building settlements and districts alongside river tiles.

Internet Archive might be most well known for its website archiver, The Wayback Machine, but, in 2020, its Open Library was sued by four major book publishers. Effectively, the Open Library is a digital library, where the Internet Archive would 'loan' digital versions of physical books it owns, to emulate a library. These books would be lent at a 1-1 rate with what it owned. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it created the National Emergency Library in response to libraries shutting down, which removed its prior lending restrictions. In June last year , Hatchet, HarperCollins, Wiley, and Penguin Random House won their suit against Internet Archive's Open Library, taking out 500,000 books from the library.

This handheld is extraordinary by several measures. First up, it's absolutely massive. The screen is 11 inches. But it comes with a centimetre-plus of bezel all round, plus a pair of huge clip-on controllers. The upshot of which is that the Abxylute 3D One pretty much dwarfs the laptop on which I'm typing these words. It's so big I have serious reservations about how realistic it is as an actual handheld device. I'm not sure I'd want to game with this beast in my actual hands for very long.

The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet.

Even back then, when game studios were a fraction of the size of today's behemoths making Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, he wanted to work with a smaller team, where his own ideas could shine through. \"Making games, money aside, it's fun, and it needs to be fun to make something fun,\" he told me over coffee in Tokyo in late September. \"With a smaller group of people, you've got all the essential elements to make a game, and they've all got their own special abilities. One is great at art, another is great at programming. And to share the vision, it's a lot less work.\" With his John Lennon glasses and a tweed newsboy cap corralling graying sideburns, Kimura is the Platonic ideal of an elder statesman indie dev. His games from the early 2000s, including controversial survival horror Rule of Rose and kissing-based life sim Chulip , have the sort of cult appeal that inspires retrospective YouTube essays and Let's Plays. But his new game Stray Children, which finally released in …",

Still your breathing and strain your ears, and you can hear, on the wind, a million people with history degrees and jobs completely unrelated to those history degrees getting incredibly excited (no shade: I'm one of them). This is Paradox's flagship grand-strategy series—its early-modern history sim that sees you guide one of a whole bunch of countries out of the late middle ages and into modernity, with almost certainly a whole lot of atrocities along the way. Our Europa Universalis 5 review is already up and, sorry to spoil you, this one sounds just as likely to suck a few hundred, or thousand, hours away from you as the last entry. \"A new bar for complexity in the historical grand strategy genre that sometimes buckles under the weight of its ambition,\" we called it.

Pillars of Eternity's director, Josh Sawyer, explained and introduced the new mode in a new video on YouTube . Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire. The biggest deal, though, is that we'll be able to freely switch between turn-based and…",

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",
