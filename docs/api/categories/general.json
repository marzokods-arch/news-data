Stars such as Olivia Dean and Lola Young lit up airwaves and festival stages across the world, while CMAT, Dave and Sam Fender all stuck gold on their respective third albums, each of which contained their most illuminating material yet. 2024 was challenging for U.K and Ireland artists at home and abroad, with a distinct lack of marquee releases from our biggest acts, plus only a handful of No. 1 singles for homegrown talent (Charli xcx, Chase &amp; Status, Hozier). The past 12 months, however, have seen something of a sea change, with the long-term development of British and Irish talent by labels finally paying its dues: Young and Dean, for example, are a prime example of why faith and patience can embolden artists to reach their full potential. Some of the year&#8217;s biggest hits were also some of the most challenging and rewarding, while some of the more conventional pop numbers that broke on a global scale felt fresher than they have in a long time.

It was a five-hour travel and then six out on the boat ride to the middle of the ocean. It was the coolest thing.

Instead, Collins infuses her style of country with a heavy dose of rock and heavy metal. “When I was growing up everyone was listening to Jesse McCartney or pop bands, but I was obsessed with Slash,” Collins says. “I loved Guns N’ Roses, Tom Petty, Alice in Chains. When I was older, my Nana gave me a stack of records when I asked for a record player, and that was Willie Nelson and George Jones [records]. And I discovered How…",

Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience.

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Meta introduced Horizon OS, its new branding for Meta Quest OS. The plan was to license Horizon OS to hardware partners, with ASUS and Lenovo initially confirmed as two. Meta now says those plans are on pause as the company focuses more on its own hardware efforts. It feels like mobile tech is at an inflection point right now when it comes to all things extended reality (XR). While the idea behind glasses-based augmented reality and mixed reality has been around for years, it’s only recently that the hardware and software powering these solutions have matured to the point where all this actually feels like it might just be commercially viable. As we look forward to what’s next from Google and Android XR , it sounds like Meta’s own XR plans are going a bit sideways. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Meet is expanding audio presentation support during video calls on macOS and Windows. Previously, users could only share audio from the specific Chrome tab they were presenting. Google Meet can now share your system audio, allowing meeting participants to hear sound from any app or source on your computer. Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

The software is available worldwide with a free trial, followed by a monthly subscription or a one-time lifetime license.

With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new Counterpoint Research report predicts that smartphone prices will rise in 2026, with average selling prices increasing by as much as 6.9% as memory costs surge. The same report points to shrinking shipments and higher manufacturing costs, pushing smartphone makers to potentially cut specs like RAM and limit budget options. For consumers, this means phones launching next year will be pricier while offering fewer meaningful upgrades. If you’ve been waiting patiently to upgrade your phone in 2026, hoping the next generation of devices will be faster, cheaper, or offer better value, we’ve got some bad news for you. Smartphones will most likely get more expensive and less featureful in the coming year compared to what you can buy today.",

    "body": "Credit: NexDock TL;DR NexDock has launched its 6th-generation lapdock for $229. It’s a PC shell that’s designed to run Samsung DeX, Android desktop modes, Windows, Linux, and handheld PCs. You get a screen, keyboard, trackpad, battery, speakers, and ports, while your phone or device handles everything else. The upgraded NexDock includes a brighter 14-inch 16:10 touchscreen and a vastly improved trackpad. If the name NexDock doesn’t ring a bell, we don’t blame you. The company has been quietly making “lapdocks” — laptop shells that turn your phone or handheld device into a full desktop — for nearly a decade. Now, NexDock is hoping to put itself back on the map with its 6th-generation NexDock, which is officially in stock and shipping worldwide.",
