I'm not including Mankind Divided's throwaway DLC or the port of dumpy tablet prequel The Fall in this calculation. Sorry to all five Deus Ex: The Fall fans. The announcement of Deus Ex Remastered made me very sad, a moment of genuine joy and surprise immediately deflated by the piece of work on offer. No one sets out to make a bad game, but I wonder what led to its seemingly sorry state, and if anyone at Aspyr, Eidos Montreal, or Embracer is surprised at the response. It looks like Deus Ex remade in its 2004 sequel, Invisible War, a \"what-if\" Doom 3 mod recreation of the levels, or, indeed, if the the infamous, long-dead Project HDTP was unleashed like a mummy's curse⁠—HDTP may have a genuine claim to being the first laughably bad retro game \"HD texture\" rework.

It debuted the following year with multiplayer maps for Return to Castle Wolfenstein —which, for the record, were excellent. That focus continued through projects including the Enemy Territory games, Brink , Dirty Bomb , and the multiplayer components of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5 . Chinese holding company Leyou acquired Splash Damage in 2016, and was then acquired itself by Tencent in 2020, which is how Splash Damage got there.

Fox Hunt is about \"high-stakes, cat-and-mouse encounters\" built around Delta's combat and stealth mechanics. Neatly enough, the name is because you're cast as a candidate member for the legendary FOX unit.

It was almost like the old days—as close as you can get in a modern software-as-a-service ecosystem, at least—and my favorite thing about Battlefield 6 so far is that EA has doubled down on Portal. In Battlefield 6, your Portal 'server' will no longer disappear after everyone leaves , sticking around in the server browser as if it were a proper rental, and the developers have expanded the map and logic editing tools . In a recent correspondence with the Portal development team, PC Gamer's Morgan Park asked whether we could go so far as to delete all of the buildings in a map to transform it into a flat wasteland.

    "body": "Borderlands 4 is full of references, and there's perhaps none more iconic than the Wombo Combo . This legendary assault rifle calls back to the infamous Super Smash Bros. Melee match in which the commentators lose their minds when a player pulls off a move of the same name. Living up to its history, the Wombo Combo in Borderlands 4 shoots two barrels at once: One is your standard assault rifle, while the other is a grenade launcher. Saying the Wombo Combo hits like a truck is an understatement, making it one of the best guns for both mobbing and bosses, even without the bonkers splash damage Rafa build . Such power surely comes with a catch, and you're right, it does: it's very easy to blow yourself up with it if you're not careful. Here's what you need to do to get the Wombo Combo.

With that said, the School puzzles in this part may throw a spanner in the works, so here's a guide for getting you through this section, girl locker codes and all. Arriving at the school with Shu and Rinko, you go to the back gate, which leads to a mountain pass—your supposed escape route from the horror that is encroaching on Ebisugaoka—only to find that it's locked. Instead of hopping over this shoulder-high obstacle, which is what I would've done, Hinako and her friends opt to enter the school in search of the key. While Shu and Rinko rest in one of the classrooms, you get voluntold to head out into the school and search for the key so you can escape into the mountains and hopefully outrun all the red spider lilies.

With the launch of the new 500+ , Raspberry is hoping to attract even more computing hobbyists to the fray, though what one modder has managed to achieve already suggests that its appeal could be even bigger than expected. The Raspberry Pi 500+ is a fairly decent update on the previous Pi 500 , changing the basic keyboard for an RGB-toting mechanical setup, doubling the system RAM from eight to 16 GB of LPDDR4x, and fitting an NVMe M.2 slot to the Pi 5's circuit board. This last aspect is the point of note here, because of what software engineer and modder Jeff Geerling chose to do with it. Rather than use it for the intended addition of a small SSD, Geerling took advantage of the fact that the M.2 slot is just a physical interface for a PCI Express connection. That means, with the help of an appropriate adapter, you can stuff pretty much any PCIe device into that slot, and the Pi 500+ should recognise it. In Geerling's case, the stuffing comprised an OCuLink cable, an external GPU dock, a Radeon RX 7900 XT , and a mere 15 lines of ad…",

That's the initial impression I got from this mouse: it's trying to innovate in a way that could actually be useful.

The selling point here is its 'InfinitePlay' hot swappable battery system. Much like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset , the Glorious Model O3 Wireless gaming mouse can boast a kind of faux-infinite battery life, because you can swap out its 200 mAh battery with another that's kept fully charged, then rinse and repeat, swapping between the two whenever one gets low. You slot an external battery into the rear end of the mouse, then when you see the battery LED on the hub drop to red and the mouse's RGB flash red, signalling battery is less than 30%, you swap it out for the one that's been charging in the hub. …",

Firing a barrage of homing projectiles, Birt's Bees has quite the sting, but it's made even better with parts like Torgue sticky bombs and a taser underbarrel, which, when activated, breaks the damage multiplier of stickies. However, Birt's Bees is one of the few legendaries locked behind side content, so if you haven't been thoroughly exploring Kairos, then you've likely glossed over the boss you need to farm. Thankfully, you can work towards it very early on. Plus, it's also where you get the Kickballer , so you could end up with not one, but two incredible legendaries for your effort.

Forza Horizon 6's teaser didn't give much away, mostly just showing a bunch of licence plates from the countries the series has raced through, but how could I not get excited by the end, when we see Mount Fuji? Sure, Forza Horizon 4 will always have a special place in my heart, since it made Blighty the star, and even let me drive around my old university haunting grounds in Edinburgh. There's nothing quite like playing a game and being able to point out a specific set of steps you once puked up on because you were 19 and couldn't hold your whisky. But Japan is an equally tantalising prospect, with its extreme terrain, densely-packed cities and striking vistas. Forza Horizon is always a looker, and I can't wait to see what Playground Games does with the new setting. And, of course, Japan is a serious car country, boasting lots of manufacturers as well as a vibrant racing scene. There's a lot more to it than Tokyo Drift. \"For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans' wish lists, so …",

That's per a news story by Famitsu (thanks, Automaton ) discussing its upcoming October issue. Relieving me of a bit of my embarrassment is the fact that the magazine itself also seems surprised, here's a quote (via machine translation): \"Surprisingly, this game does not have what is known as a 'character gacha,' and basically, you can get all of the playable characters just by playing the game. Seriously?! … So, what are the in-game elements that require payment? Mainly the parts that allow players to customize their clothes, vehicles, homes, and more to their liking.\" In other words, this isn't a Genshin Impact—it's just shaping up to be a solid open-world, free-to-play RPG with cute outfits and furniture you can buy with money.

I'll admit, I don't really see the appeal of simulating an activity one could also readily engage in—so imagine my confusion when I heard about Deutschland's remote robotaxis. In the now-defunct Tegel airport in Berlin, drivers take to impressive driving simulator rigs to remotely control cars up and down the runway (via The Guardian ). Pressing pedals from hundreds of metres away, the remote drivers monitor car movement over a video feed captured by four cameras on each vehicle's roof. These remote drivers' setup is giving me serious rig envy. Many of the picks in our best PC racing wheels guide are swish, but the setup here is a cut above even that. Besides monitoring car movement on a generously sized triple monitor setup, the remote drivers also enjoy the plush cups of what appears to be the Logitech G430 wired headset.

I couldn't do it. My Yakuza journey ground to a halt. From the hands-on time I've had with Kiwami 3, it's a remake that doesn't reinvent the original, but—like the two Kiwamis before it—polishes it to a shine, bolts on some fantastic new nonsense in substories and activities, and acts as a glitzy refresh for a generation that, perhaps, didn't get to it back in 2009.

The official remaster will feature \"new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,\" according to a post from Aspyr on the PlayStation Blog . They've also rebuilt the character models, added lip-syncing to the dialogue, and thrown ragdolls into the mix. (I'll basically never say no to ragdolls, so sure, why not?)
