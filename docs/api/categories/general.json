Nothing quite exemplifies this more than the great big silver Xbox prototype shown off just before the release of Sony's mega-popular PlayStation 2. One YouTuber, Macho Nacho Productions (via Hackaday ), is such a big fan of this aesthetic that they've decided to build their own version, complete with a custom-milled aluminium chassis and the original Xbox internals, albeit with some light upgrades to bring it slightly more into the modern age.. To try and get an understanding of the specific size of the prototype Xbox, Macho Nacho found an image with a Microsoft Sidewinder game pad next to it that was captured at some point in the early 2000s. After comparing a 3D rendering of the two side by side, they then decided that it wasn't quite accurate enough. Macho Nacho took a trip out to New York to see a prototype in a display case, where they took pictures of that case from many angles and sent them to a 3D modeller, where they then created a Gaussian Splat. Effectively, this method grabs as many pictures as possi…",

Earlier this month, Yokohama City University's Minds1020Lab began trialling \"anime therapy\", as reported by itmedia (thanks, Automaton , for the translation). Here's how it works: Participants will choose one of six anime avatars, each with their unique backstory. Then, in what looks to be a visual-novel style interface, a psychologist will take on the role of said anime character and conduct a counselling session. Some questionnaire-based psychological evaluation happens before and after these sessions, too. Something interesting that's implied here, per Automaton, is the fact that a large chunk of these sessions will also be devoted to learning about these anime characters and their place in the fictional world that Minds1020Lab has set up, here.

Credit to Hemsworth, his performance is indeed: Fine. As if by design, the season's writing stuffs Geralt behind the rest of his adventuring party where he can't commit the sin of being memorable, even for being great, however unlikely that would have been. The Witcher season 4 begins with a set of flashbacks recapping the series so far, sliding Hemsworth into retellings of old scenes as if he'd been there all along. It's a weird first gambit—Netflix attempting to swap the dead goldfish on us even though we've known this was coming for years.

That number includes a lot of extremely skippable short story anthologies, and multiple novels so tangential you won't miss anything if you don't read them. If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change.

Unlike the other event plants, you'll have a few extra steps to follow before you can pluck these strange flowers and throw them into the cauldron. It's one of five resources added exclusively for Halloween, and seems to be the most common ingredient among the new recipes. Since I've been farming candy like mad to trade for the Witch class , I'm painfully familiar with how to get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest and here to provide a guided tour through the forest. How get Stareweed in 99 Nights in the Forest Before you can pick Stareweed, you'll need to grow it, so collect 10 flowers and find the Fairy's house on your map. She sells one pack of Stareweed Seeds (and other Halloween plants) for 10 flowers a bag—bring 50 if you want to save yourself a trip buying the other seeds.
