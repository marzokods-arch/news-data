I remember computers having floppy disk drives, but by the time I was regularly using a PC, it was all CD and DVD. Now, I can get a chance to use those gloriously flat and solid little drives with open source project RFIDisk (via Hackaday ). Well, I can do so provided I have a 3D printer. Which I do not—bummer. And if I use Linux, which again I do not ( not anymore , anyway). Still, a man can dream, and this man is dreaming of popping floppy disks into an RFID scanner. Which is what this thing is, by the way: It doesn't actually read the floppy disk, it just fits a floppy disk and scans an RFID code to boot up apps on a connected PC. As the creator ItsDanik explains: \"RFIDisk turns RFID tags into physical shortcuts that launch games, apps, or scripts when inserted on a retro-styled 'floppy drive' reader. Think of it as a cross between an RFID scanner and a USB floppy disk drive.\" RFID means radio frequency identification and is what's used for contactless payments, among other things. The 3…",

So, it likely comes as no surprise that I've been pining after the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 headset since it was first announced (ghost type Pokemon are some of my favourites, and it's not just because they often adhere to my carefully curated colour scheme). While I enjoyed my time with the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , I'm still not a huge fan of the headset's pastel pink 'quartz' colourway. So, when I heard the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is now available outside of Asia , I was there with my Pokeballs at the ready. Obviously, there are a few key differences to note between the V3 Pro and this pretty purple version of the V2. Besides the kitty ears getting swapped out for the ghostie's wee purple horns, the main difference is that the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is a wired headset. That means a stable, constant connection at the risk of forgetting about the wire all together and potentially dragging your rig behind you when you leave your desk…but what sort of Slowpoke would do that, right? The wire itself is contained within a hardy plastic sheathing that could likely withstand a chewing from a deskchair castor (not that I'd recomme…",

Of course, we haven't seen any characters, but the three images shown on the roadmap give away who we can anticipate arriving. Though, it wouldn't be unusual for Dreamlight Valley to throw in some curveballs either. It currently seems like \"early 2026\" will bring Lady and the Tramp, as suggested by a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a Parisian street. Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves. Finally, a statue of Phil in a biome that looks a lot like Mythopia, alongside Hercules' sandals suggests that Hercules may be coming in Summer. This is as much as the roadmap reveals, and whoever is arriving in winter is yet to be announced. I can't imagine we'll see any sort of teaser until we are well into next year. (Image credit: Gameloft) I'm excited to see more 'classic' Disney characters coming in 2026 if these predictions are right. As much as I loved the addition of Joy …",

Stop giggling at the back, I know where you were going. Anyway, the myAir.0 OriMouse came to my attention this morning (via PC Watch ). It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing. Otherwise, I think it looks like a pretty neat technical achievement. The sensor …",

The laws of physics have a tight grip on audio reproduction, and the sad fact is that large, expensive speakers will always be better than smaller ones, as well as looking cooler and making you more attractive to the kind of people you want to be found attractive by. These are facts. Another fact is that, luckily, it's quite easy to upgrade from monitor speakers, which are only getting smaller and therefore worse as displays (and indeed laptops, which suffer from the same audio blight) get thinner to actual PC speakers . This soundbar from Creative, the Sound Blaster GS3 , isn't exactly huge either, and doesn't cost a lot of money. It's an entry-level audio solution for desktop PC gaming, and while it's always going to be better than using the speakers built into your screen—or indeed having no speakers at all—let me be clear, you shouldn't expect miracles. That said, there's a lot to like here. It's a stubby little bar perfectly sized to sit on the flat part of your monitor stand's foot, with two little rubber feet to stop it sliding around.

And even though Ubisoft has confirmed that it's working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell, we haven't heard hardly anything about it in several years. I even took the opportunity to ask Splinter Cell: Blacklist director Guillaume Dousse if he could shed some light on the next Splinter Cell game when we chatted last week, but he regretfully said he didn't have \"the security clearance\" to get us any new info. Ah well, I tried.

But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards.

The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

Specs-wise, other than the simple fact that the new GPU, codenamed Crescent Island, is using that next-gen Xe3P technology, there's little to go on. The only other detail is 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",

Côté's departure, initially reported by IGN , comes just two weeks after Ubisoft unveiled a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios that will be responsible for all future development of Assassin's Creed, as well as Far Cry and Rainbow Six. \"Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft,\" a Ubisoft representative said in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"While we are saddened to see him go, we're confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build. We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin's Creed brand into what it is today.

The world's first external drive to feature it, in fact. It's also recently won the Japan Good Design Award 2025, a prize I didn't know existed until today.

It's also got a keychain hole (all good portable devices should), a USB Type-C port, and the built-in ability to track it the same way you would an Apple AirTag. That's because the Cupertino-based fruit enthusiasts have provided the tracking tech inside, meaning you can track its location with the Find My app. It doesn't look like Android phones are supported, so bang goes my dreams of owning one—but iPhone users should take note, as it looks like quite a handy way of lugging your files around.
