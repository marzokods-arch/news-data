    "body": "chilldspot dropped its third album, entitled handmade Wednesday (Sept. 24). The three-member band from Japan signed with the Chinese label MODERN SKY last year, stepping up its presence in the region. With headlining concerts and festival slots fueling a steady rise in recognition and popularity, chilldspot’s stage is expanding further than ever before. At the same time, the departure of a member proved a pivotal moment, shaping chilldspot into an even tougher, more tightly knit collective. Brimming with a variety of sounds and uplifting words, handmade stands as proof of the band’s growth. Billboard Japan spoke with the three members — Hiyune, Ryozan, and Kozaki — about the journey that led to this album in this latest interview. chilldspot’s live shows have been growing in scale, and you’ve even played overseas festivals, expanding your activities in ways you probably hadn’t quite imagined. How does that feel? Hiyune (vocals &amp; guitar): Being in Japan, it almost feels unreal, but seeing tickets for our Beijing solo show sell out instantly, and playing festivals where, of course, we’re not the only draw, yet the stages have grown to hold thousands of people… I don’t know the e…",

From her wardrobe to the stage design to many of her guitars and even the miniature solo cup she took a shot from, all were bathed in the blue color palette from her latest album, Am I Okay? But the mood was anything but blue, as the self-proclaimed “Emo Cowgirl” brought a performance full of heart, sass, confidence and good vibes that her adoring fans lapped up for the show’s entire one hour and 45-minute duration. To gauge just how quickly the country star’s ascent has been, as she reminded the audience, the last time she headlined a venue in Los Angeles in 2023, it was the 500-capacity Troubadour.
