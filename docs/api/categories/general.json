The company attributed this delay to an increase in RAM pricing and as well as a temporary shortage. Affected customers can choose the Odin 3 Max instead and get a refund for the price difference. We’ve seen a major spike in RAM prices in recent weeks, and it’s expected that these price hikes could result in Android phones with less RAM than before. Now, a prominent Android handheld brand has announced that this saga is affecting their own new product. AYN has announced on IndieGogo and Discord that shipments of the Odin 3 Ultra model, which features 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, have been delayed to mid-January 2026. The company cited the “skyrocketing” price of RAM and a temporary memory shortage.",

The phone features a Dimensity 6300 chip, stereo speakers, and support for Dolby Atmos. Buying a budget phone often means making trade-offs. You might get a great screen but a weak battery, or a sturdy phone that takes poor photos. For the past few years, Motorola has tried to solve this problem with its G Power series, and now it looks like the company is making another strong attempt. Motorola has announced the Moto G Power 2026, and while it looks familiar, there are some key changes under the hood that might make it the sub-$300 phone to beat in 2026.",

According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers.

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity .

Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size.

    "body": "One UI 8.5 (left) and iOS 26 Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Samsung’s One UI has always proudly sported its own personality. It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

    "body": "Credit: Jonathan Feist / Android Authority TL;DR Popular robot vacuum Roomba’s maker, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy. iRobot’s business will transition to a new owner, which is also its primary manufacturer. The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

    "summary": "This level of stagnation is unforgivable.",
    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nx5OLMak2s The more we hear about the upcoming Galaxy S26 series, the more underwhelming this launch feels. For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",
