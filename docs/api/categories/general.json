The new finish applies to the front-lit Colorsoft model, available in 32GB and 64GB configurations. This is a design update only, with no changes to hardware, specs, or features. Good news for anyone who wants a Kindle Scribe Colorsoft that’s a little more colorful. Amazon’s largest note-taking e-reader will soon be available in Fig, a warm berry-toned color that lands somewhere between plum and deep cranberry. It’s a fairly refined colorway that offers a little more personality than the standard Graphite without being overly bold. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft first debuted in the US on December 10, 2025, introducing Amazon’s latest generation of the Scribe lineup with an 11-inch color E Ink display, adjustable front light, and improved performance. Since launch, the Colorsoft model has been available in a single utilitarian gray (Graphite) from Amazon and major retailers.",

As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding.

Instead of the regular 25W charging, the base Galaxy S26 might support 45W charging. While the rumor had previously been refuted, it has resurfaced, making us wonder whether it’s actually true. The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

Now, the company could actually do more than produce Pixel phones outside China. Nikkei Asia reports that Google plans to both develop and manufacture high-end Pixel phones in Vietnam in 2026.

The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",
