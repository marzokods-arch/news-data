In a recent video (via Techeblog ), it's shown forehanding, backhanding, and smashing ping pong balls with impressive dexterity and, dare I say it, human- like movement. What's so visually impressive about it, at least to my eyes, is how it keeps balance and makes quick decisions and very human-like arm and leg movements. In particular, as someone who used to play a lot of table tennis and who wasn't awful at it, I was genuinely impressed by how HITTER returns smashes, and also with the return at 0:28 right off the edge of the table.

Taking two hits of damage rather than the one we were used to in Hollow Knight (since it was so rare for an enemy to inflict two) has certainly been a learning curve for a lot of people. But that hasn't stopped the usual suspects declaring that the game isn't difficult and those struggling simply need to \"get good\". If you fall among this crowd, I applaud you and just know every time I run back to the Savage Beastfly arena I'm struck with a pang of jealousy. But if you're (somehow) finding the game too easy, fret not. There's now a mod that allows you to increase the double damage caused by some enemies to triple. The 'No Double Damage' mod created by TheLima does exactly what it says on the tin, but not in the way you'd think. It's easy to assume this title means the mod will take you back to a time where enemies would only cause you one hit of damage since it markets itself on simply removing double damage.…",

It also lets you insult someone so hard that they just die, which is also the case in Baldur's Gate 3 . Larian went real overboard on the depth and breadth of insults with this singular cantrip—even giving one NPC bespoke, trauma-invoking dunks just to twist the knife even more. But there was a time when these insults were just plain dookie. No, literally. As spotted by our friends over at GamesRadar+ , a recent stream with junior writer Martin Docherty revealed that poor beleaguered studio head Swen Vincke had to tell the BG3 team to tone it down with the scat-based dunking. He recounts a time when he'd collected a bunch of Vicious Mockery insults into a big sheet: \"Swen had a look at them, and he was like: 'Ah. Hm.

From the company behind the Hitman series, this third-person action-adventure game places gamers in the shoes of a young James Bond before he has earned his 00 status, with the agent needing to go on a globe-trotting adventure to fulfil his mission. And, from what we've seen so far, First Light is shaping up to be the first game in well over a decade that delivers the genuine James Bond dream of being a suave, slick-talking and fast-shooting super spy. First Light seems to be coming with a licence to thrill! (Image credit: Future) Our features in this issue don't stop there, though, as we've also got two other great long reads. First, we have a deep-dive into Raw Fury, the publishing house that is now famous for its exceptional indie catalogue of games. To get the inside scoop on Raw Fury's approach to the gaming industry, discover the secret of its success, and find out what hot indie new games it has coming down the line, PC Gamer speaks directly to the publisher's CEO Pim Holfve, as well as the firm's beloved dog, Ponyo.

I can't remember there ever being this much buzz for an exploration platformer before, but aside from the aforementioned difficulty, there's probably a few good reasons why you might bounce off Silksong. Perhaps you suffer entomophobia? Maybe you abhor protracted boss run backs ? Or maybe you're just averse to hype and want to dive into Silksong once the buzz has quietened down and the post-launch updates have smoothed its roughest edges? If you don't like Silksong but do love labyrinthine 2D platformers, we've put together a list of some great alternatives.

Just one big goddamn blur. I remember attacking German artillery positions at Pointe du Hoc but I also remember floating around in a space station while shooting people with an assault rifle and I also remember spending hours with some guy yelling at me about the numbers, Mason!

The quiz includes PC, console, mobile, handheld, and free-to-play games, and it isn't really designed for you to win, it's designed for you to mumble \"Oh, yeah, I totally forgot about roughly two dozen Call of Duty games\" when you see all the ones you missed.

Listed on the Steam page was the insistence that the game would require eight CPU cores as a minimum, which seemed highly unlikely given how many speedy six core processors there are on the market. So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close. Taking a look at those CPU minimums once more, we've got the Intel Core i7 9700 and the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X …",
