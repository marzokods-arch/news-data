Quite the damning opening paragraph that, especially as a hardware journalist with a reputation to uphold and all, but here me out. I've got beef, and it's with TGP, or total graphics power. This here is the Gigabyte Aero X16 Copilot. A quick glance down the specs list, and you'll see it's brimming with some seriously impressive hardware, or so it would seem anyway. There's one of AMD's latest Ryzen AI 7 350 CPUs based on the Krackan Point architecture, a healthy dose of 32 GB DDR5 clocking in at 5,600 MT/s, a nice 1 TB helping of PCIe 4.0 SSD storage, and perhaps more importantly for this whimsical argument, an RTX 5070 8 GB mobile GPU. But there's a catch: it's limited to just 85 W. That's the same 85 W power limit Gigabyte placed on its Gaming A16 I tested earlier this year as well, with its RTX 5060.

Case in point: on Tuesday colony builder Generation Exile dropped on Steam to a total of three user reviews, despite a seasoned indie team behind it. Studio founder Nels Anderson was previously the lead designer of masterful stealth game Mark of the Ninja before co-founding Campo Santo to make Firewatch. Generation Exile's team also includes Karla Zimonja, designer on Gone Home and Tacoma, and Niamh Fitzgerald, lead designer of hit traffic sim Mini Motorways . Oh, and a soundtrack from FTL and Into the Breach composer Ben Prunty!? Maybe the problem is the Steam page doesn't mention that the game's got capybaras in it .

Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play.

If you've been a PC enthusiast for as long as I have, then you'll probably look at SilverStone's new full-tower case with a warm heart and happy, fuzzy feelings. That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.
