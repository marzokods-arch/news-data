As spotted by Hackaday , the half-hour-long video of the YouTuber making a 'portable' Xbox Original is sort of like the lovechild of a mad scientist, a teacher, and a stream of consciousness. After grabbing an Xbox that isn't working, James figures out that the DVD drive is flagging a hard drive issue, and fixes the DVD drive by replacing a tiny failing resistor with four separate, much bigger resistors, then hot-glueing them down. This is subsequently followed by smacking the top of the Xbox until the disk tray comes out. Then, after fixing the original Xbox, James takes it apart again and starts throwing the bits of plastic he doesn't need on the floor. Taking apart this plastic is important to get the central motherboard and necessary components as small as possible, and he replaces the big unwieldy hard drive with a CompactFlash drive, saving a little more space. …",

With Rockstar already calling it the \" largest game launch in history \" over half a year out from release, I'm pretty sure the only people who aren't feeling some kind of way about it are uncontacted in the Amazon or… they're Steven Ogg, who played Trevor Philips in GTA 5. In a recent, brief chat with YouTuber HarrisonShippp , Ogg was asked how excited he was for GTA 6's release next year. \"I feel nothing inside,\" answered Ogg, definitively. And just in case you're wondering if that's a more general cry for help, he quickly made clear he was speaking specifically about GTA: \"I'm not a gamer. I've never played a videogame, so I feel absolutely nothing.\" Which, hey, fair enough. Some voice actors get super deep into their roles—like the cast of Baldur's Gate 3—and for others it's just a paycheque. Neither's an illegitimate approach, and Ogg has made clear before that he's not keen on GTA fans essentially treating him like Trevor in real life. But then it gets a little weirder. \"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'\" recounted Ogg. \"I said, 'Why?' They said 'Because it's so great!' And I said,…",

The recent release of the generally excellent Metal Gear Solid Delta , and what looks like a good reception for Silent Hill f, suggests that this tanker might be on the turn.

I don't want a combat system where I can master the timings and get into a flow state, I want it to be janky and panicked like it's simulating what it would be like for an ordinary person to be handed a plank with a nail in it and thrown in a room with a monster made of nightmares. To cut a long story short, Silent Hill F is not that kind of game. It's the kind with an involved combat system it really wants you to get to grips with.

User Avdievs in the Steam discussion page for the patch points out that DLSS' texture filtering and antialiasing components can be desirable even in a game that should be easy to run⁠—and Legends of the Zone can be much more of a performance hog than the original releases. \"That DLSS is the perfect option for the ones wishing to play with their insanely taxing indirect lighting in 4k 60+ fps,\" wrote user Spleen, referring to a new graphical feature introduced with Legends of the Zone's enhanced global illumination.

Why? Well, that's easy. Baldur's Gate 2 is a good game. It's a very good game, actually: a plane-hopping, swashbuckling, high-fantasy adventure filled with great performances and memorable characters. But that's not quite enough explanation, is it? There have been a lot of very good games in the past few decades, and not all of them get anniversary write-ups. Heck, personally I'm more of a Baldur's Gate 1 guy, and yet I don't think I said a thing when that game's 25-year anniversary hit two years ago. It's because Baldur's Gate 2 is a lot more than just Baldur's Gate 2. It represents BioWare hitting on an approach to design that would define it—and consequently, so much other RPG development—for over a decade afterwards. BioWare never stopped making Baldur's Gate 2 once it made it the first time. Dig in almost any RPG, especially one that has you roll deep with a party of whining misfits, and you can find a trace of it. Party mode The obvious …",

The headline feature of this patch was a newly added playpark for kids to run themselves ragged on, as well as a 'play pretend' interaction for kids who presumably can't get to said playpark for whatever reason.

In 1998, Baldur's Gate redefined what a computer RPG – and videogame interpretation of the D&D ruleset – could be. Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made. Many of the great RPGs are etched into the popular imagination by their beginnings, those tentative first steps in a new fantasy world that tease the vastness ahead, and the freedom to carve your own path through it. The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla. Surrounded by golden minarets, it's a bustling amphitheater of traders and thieves, wealthy and poor – a filthy and vibrant snapshot of urban plenitude.

Madness' fast-paced, hyper-violent shorts involve grey, cross-faced people blasting each other to smithereens.

According to the latest Global Games Market Report from the analysts at industry intelligence firm Newzoo, Gen Alpha—defined in this case as anyone born in or after 2010—makes up \"an increasing share of the player base, especially on PC.\" As a lifelong fan of computer games, this is good news to me. The kids are with us! But the kids aren't necessarily playing the kinds of games I grew up on: You may have heard of that excruciatingly popular platform called Roblox where kids are pressured to spend their parents' money in games like \"Steal a Brainrot.\" (Which, to be fair, does sound like something you'd find on Newgrounds circa 2000, so maybe we're not all that different.) Earlier this week, I spoke to Newzoo director of market intelligence Emmanuel Rosier about what young gamers are up to, and two aspects of his perspective stuck out to me the most: Gen Alpha doesn't care if it can run Crysis. They're growing up playing browser games, tablet games, phone games, and games on low-powered family PCs. You can't win the Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox generation over with ray tracing. They aren't necessarily going to leave Roblox behind. It's a comm…",

    "body": "Acquiring the grappling hook doesn't happen all that quickly in Dying Light: The Beast , but since it was such an important item in Dying Light: Stay Human, you're probably wondering how to get it into Kyle Crane's toolbelt. Without skyscrapers to dangle from, the grappling hook isn't quite as useful as it was in Stay Human, but you can still use it to pull yourself towards walls and trees, and swing from it once it's hooked to something. It can be upgraded, too, which makes it more effective and able to latch onto enemies, pull them toward you, and knock them down. Unfortunately I can't just point you to a spot on the map like I did with the Dying Light: The Beast's Sawblade Launcher , because the grappling hook is a reward for completing a story quest, and it's a quest you probably won't advance to until you're a little more than halfway through the game. If you simply don't want to wait, you can rush through the story quests one right after another, but I would recommend doing at least a few sidequests along the way, too.

If you're wondering what's so unprofessional about the overview, he goes on to freestyle a few facts about the game, like how its ambient soundtrack is \"kind of subtle and cool and interesting, unlike anything you've ever played,\" before transitioning to what feels like the end of his spiel. \"Are you interested in novelty? Are you a novelty-seeking person? I don't know. You just want to play the same thing over and over again, maybe. Maybe you like League of Legends, that's fine. You're probably not going to buy this game … Alright. Hope you buy it. Goodbye.\" After this is said, there are seven minutes left to go in the video. Cuzzillo notes that he's \"not going to do the edit\" and then just… starts over and reintroduces \"the first fact\" about Baby Steps. This happens a few times, but there are some insights to be gleaned here. For instance…",
