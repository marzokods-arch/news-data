However, it was enough time to realise that, while on paper they seem like they might be a good idea, in practice, it's... complicated. The idea is, you get a virtual 177-inch monitor beamed in front of your eyeballs via a Micro-OLED display within the glasses, covering 95% of your vision with a 57-degree field of view of excellent gaming fidelity. Why have a massive screen on your wall, when you can have a tiny one that creates the same effect in a wearable form factor ? Mmm. We'll get on to that in a minute, because I've got some ergonomic issues to discuss first. For a start, there's a substantial cable attached to the rear of the left arm, which makes putting them on a very awkward event. I did it in public and nearly poked myself in the eye, as the glasses seem destined to fall in on themselves as you bring them towards your face. Secondly, they made me look like a dork.

The ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 of yesteryear was undoubtedly a cool experiment, but eh, that slim second screen didn't exactly light my world on fire. This new one, though? I have to say, it's an awfully nice machine to experience in person. As I type this piece, I'm sitting in my hotel room using a laptop with a 15-inch display. It's a decent size for gaming, but I'll be honest, juggling tabs around between dual browser windows is a massive pain in the arse. Whereas the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo (2026) looks like a delight to use for just such a purpose. You get two whole 16-inch 3K 120 Hz OLED screens to play with, hinged in the middle like a gigantic book, with the bottom screen holding most of the internals.

Thankfully, the Stator blueprint isn't all that far from your starting point—in fact, you've probably spotted the location the moment you stepped out of the landing pod—though you will have to do some running and bug-killing to find it.

As noticed by Rock, Paper, Shotgun , PEGI has posted a rating for a game called Life is Strange: Reunion, and even given us an outline of what it's all about. The title itself is also a pretty clear hint as to what's coming. \"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret,\" the PEGI rating page says. \"Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help.

But a group of players found out this week that there is such a thing as too much damage in Path of Exile 2. At a certain point, the game can't calculate the numbers anymore and, instead of pulling a Diablo 4 and going negative , the damage just stops. The boss health bar doesn't budge like some kind of punishment for pushing it further than the developers intended. YouTuber Swedge , and a few other players, discovered that PoE 2 shares the same damage cap as Path of Exile 1 by lighting bosses on fire for obscene amounts of damage. They put together builds that complement each other by multiplying the damage output to the highest degree. But the result was far from satisfying. If you manage to hit a boss for over 35.79 million damage per second, the game refuses to calculate it anymore. But unlike PoE 1, PoE 2 doesn't let the damage roll just under the cap, it turns it off completely. The …",

Historically, QLC isn't what you want anywhere near your SSD, due to its high bits per cell leading to sluggish performance and questionable reliability. But times are changing; last year, SK Hynix introduced 321-layer QLC flash memory chips that boasted 100% faster transfer speeds and up to 56% greater write performance than earlier QLC memory.

Microsoft announced the addition of cooperative vectors to Direct3D, which is pretty much required to implement neural rendering in games, and AMD's FSR Redstone is as AI-based as anything from Intel and Nvidia.

    "body": "Final Fantasy 14's North American servers have been hammered by DDoS attacks since the release of Patch 7.4—I'd know, I play on them—which has players starting to grind their teeth in frustration. Especially given the release of the latest Savage (high-difficulty) raid tier, and the race to world first that buoys it. Take a look at the game's official status page , and you'll see notice after notice detailing \"recoveries from DDoS\" attacks, most of which kicked off in September, primarily affecting North American data centers. On a personal note, most of my gaming sessions, as someone who plays on one of these things, have been interrupted by a DDoS error at some point. There's also an X account that tracks them , cataloguing them via a website called is.xiv.up. Have a gander at the r/ffxiv subreddit at the time of writing, and you'll see a legion of players that are (quite rightly) miffed: \"Exactly when do we get pissed about this constantly happening?\" writes one player . \"We have been, it doesn't seem to help,\" replies another . In a separate thread , user LastTraintoSector6 writes: \"I'm not trying to be alarmist, but I've only been playing about four hours tonight and have bee…",

This quickly becomes an issue when you need the Rotor blueprint and Tube blueprint to craft each of these vital items. At this point, you're no doubt asking what a blueprint item even is. Spoiler: You won't be able to get them from the safety of your base. No, you'll need to gear up and venture out to explore the planet. While you don't actually have to go all that far to find the Rotor and Tube blueprints (both are located in the same area, thankfully), it is heavily infested with scary monsters. Whatever you do, don't stroll on over with just your mining laser. You should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets. StarRupture Rotor and Tube blueprint locations As shown in the video above, you can find both the Rotor and Tube blueprints in the SMB 'Purple Haze' outpost, also known as Selenian's Mining Base, to the northwest of the lander where you start the game. More specifically, they're inside a blue chest on the ground floor of the two-storey building at the back of the outpost. The front door is loc…",

    "body": "A laptop's panel can account for over half of its overall power usage, according to Intel, hence why it's teamed up with Samsung Display on a new OLED technology to reduce power consumption by as much as 22%. It's called SmartPowerHDR. It works by analysing each frame's peak brightness in real-time, sending that data to the panel's Timing Controller (TCON), which then optimises the voltage sent to the panel based on how many pixels are active on-screen. More or less, it's adapting the voltage depending on what the screen displays. Today's HDR modes apply a fixed voltage. \"Traditional HDR modes remain locked at maximum brightness, resulting in excessive power usage even in standard scenarios,\" the press release reads. \"As a result, many laptops default to SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) mode despite the color and brightness advantages of HDR.\" The benefit, as reported by the two companies, is around a 22% power saving in general usage with SmartPowerHDR, or around a 17% reduction during HDR content. True HDR content is going to request a higher voltage more often, such as a game with HDR support. Whereas things like web browsing, finding files or typing in documents don't really need …",

Unveiled during CES 2026, it's the Taiwanese company's 12th 'Signature Chassis' and it's called Aeon. However, its angular glass panelling is hardly the most dramatic thing about it. Don't get me wrong, the mosaic mirrored panels are very snazzy but perhaps a little too attention-grabbing for any room I could realistically picture it in. With a base measuring 840 mm by 691 mm plus a height of 912 mm, it's not just these odd angles that present a practical placement challenge either. Buckle up, because the InWin Aeon PC case possesses one of the most extra opening mechanisms I've yet seen . First, you need to trigger the opening mechanism by swiping an RFID card across the PC case's base. Then, the case's back opens and is gently lowered to lie flat via a hydraulic mechanism. This is meant to afford easy hardware installation but it's a whole lot of fanfare just to open your PC case—Not to mention additional potential points of failure. InWin isn't calling this a 'Signature Chassis' for no reason. It's currently unclear whether the Aeon will …",

It's explained briefly in the tutorial, but generating electricity and working out how to connect power to said machinery isn't all that intuitive, despite how simple it is on paper. If you've been placing Ore Excavators and other key machines willy-nilly, and they're not turning on despite having an army of solar panels, then you know something's wrong. Below, I'll go over how you actually connect power to the various tech around your base, which I've learned the hard way. How to generate and connect power in StarRupture (Image credit: Creepy Jar) To connect power to your base in StarRupture, you need to build a generator of some kind, like a solar panel, and connect it to machines using either rails, platform foundations, or bridges . There are no wires in StarRupture, but all rails and floor pieces conduct electricity. Ideally, then, your base won't have any dirt visible by the end as you'll cover it all with walkways and machines to daisy-chain power. You need to place power generators around either your Base Core or production machines—Or…",

That unfortunately means none of the top-tier gags our Jess identified as possibilities for the vertical roller, but for that sacrifice you get a portable laptop capable of widescreen gaming. CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. It's only a concept, so there's no actual product to get your mitts on, but as far as concept products go, I actually quite like this one. I love narrower 14-inch and 16-inch form factors for portability, and the aspect ratio is great for work and general use, but for gaming I prefer a standard 16:9 ratio. Not only does it feel more immersive, but because of the way they're designed, many games will actually cut off a little of your field of view when you chop off some real estate.

But Pulsar's refresh rate-matched backlight strobing tech makes such a difference to the way your eye perceives moving objects on a screen, looking at a regular monitor in motion now feels like a lesser experience.
