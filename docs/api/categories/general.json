    "body": "Taylor Swift continues her domination of the ARIA charts this week, locking in her fourth consecutive double-header as The Life of a Showgirl and “The Fate of Ophelia” remain at No. 1 on the Albums and Singles charts, respectively. The feat marks yet another high in a standout year for Swift, with both her re-recordings and original material continuing to perform strongly in Australia. Her latest chart-toppers have held steady across Halloween week — a fitting flex for a pop sorceress who’s made chart magic her signature move. Meanwhile, Australian country artist James Johnston celebrates a new career high, debuting at No. 5 with his sophomore album Where You’ll Find Me , which also lands at No. 1 on the ARIA Australian Albums Chart. It follows the success of his debut Raised Like That , which peaked at No. 7 in 2023. British pop icon Lily Allen returns to the top 10 with West End Girl , her first album in seven years. The project opens at No. 6, becoming her fifth top 10 ARIA album. Her previous efforts include 2009’s chart-topping It’s Not Me, It’s You and 2014’s Sheezus , which peaked at No. 4.

The OnePlus 15T is expected to feature a larger battery, an improved fingerprint scanner, and a new Snapdragon chipset. The sad part, though, is that OnePlus might not launch it in the US. The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S . Therefore, it could be speculated to be called the OnePlus 15T or 15S, in line with the naming convention for the recently launched flagship.",

The feature works by only downloading videos in social media apps when you are “ready to watch them.” This feature can help users with limited mobile data plans manage their social media data usage effectively. One UI 8.5 is expected to be a big update for Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets, in ways that One UI 8 wasn’t. We’re expecting plenty of new features, ranging from Pro camera presets and sharing to Galaxy S26 Ultra exclusive features like Private Display , and more. We’ve now spotted another new feature in the works for One UI 8.5, and this one will likely be appreciated by people who don’t have unlimited data access all the time.

The Halloween broadcast marks one of the first full performances tied to Everybody Scream , the group’s first full-length album since 2022’s Dance Fever, which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the U.K.’s Official Albums Chart .

We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR AT&amp;T recently launched an ad campaign that uses the BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division findings to criticize T-Mobile for “un-truths.” The NAD has ordered AT&amp;T to remove the promotional material, which it says violates ad-industry rules. The carrier has now filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the self-regulatory body. You may have caught the commercial by now, where AT&amp;T uses Luke Wilson to talk about T-Mobile as a “master of breaking promises.” The commercial in question highlights the Un-Carrier’s deceptive ads and other transgressions. It’s maybe one of the most direct attacks AT&amp;T has taken against a rival in a long time. Now AT&amp;T is fighting for the right to keep its campaign up.

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Gemini shortcut, part of the Google app, on Android now uses a true black background instead of gray. Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic.
