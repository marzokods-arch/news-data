    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

By November of this year, 92% of upgrades and 85% of new activations are expected to be app-based. The aggressive shift risks alienating both customers and employees if the app experience falls short. Just yesterday, we learned that T-Mobile’s current CEO will be stepping down in November, signaling a shift to an AI-centric, digital-first future. At the time, I suggested this would likely mean customer service would move further away from retail, as well as human reps. Now, a new leak on Reddit suggests this ramp-up is coming sooner rather than later. According to an internal roadmap released by a disgruntled salesperson, nearly 100% of major customer service actions will be handled through the T Life app by the end of 2026. This includes new account setups, line additions, and upgrades.",

The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Background The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has reviewed flight, ground test, and published data on ultraviolet-induced degradation of silicone based thermal control coatings. Analysis has shown, for at least one silicone coating, that bake-out plays an important role in ultraviolet (UV) degradation, indicating that UV interaction with paint volatiles, and not the structural material, is the primary source of coating discoloration. Discussion Spacecraft temperature is primarily determined by the absorptivity and emissivity of the vehicle’s coating. Absorptivity is the fraction of the sun’s irradiance that is absorbed, and emissivity determines the amount of infrared power that is emitted. The combination of these properties, along with additional heat from internal sources and other external radiation sources, determines the spacecraft’s thermal environment. Choosing an appropriate coating, referred to as a thermal control coating, is key to keeping the vehicle within a desired temperature range. However, these coatings can degrade, (i.e., darken), in low earth orbit (LEO), primarily due to solar UV exposure, complicating the choice of coating. Zinc-oxide (ZnO) scatte…",

USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds.

And we recently came across purported hands-on images of the OnePlus 15 , which highlight the changes on the back. Although the authenticity of these images could not be ascertained, another teaser from earlier today suggests this change might be legitimate after all. The teaser does not come from OnePlus, but its parent company OPPO, which is set to unveil its flagship Find X9 series on October 16. That is just one day after the reveal of ColosOS 16, which has been confirmed to drive the OnePlus 15 in China. OPPO has been teasing the Find X9 series over the last couple of weeks.

The email said US account services are shutting down on September 28. That naturally raised a few eyebrows. These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next?

APV will enable lossless video recording with minimal degradation in quality and color. Samsung is also said to include the option to add LUTs to LOG videos directly from the Gallery app. Apple’s iPhone has traditionally been acclaimed as the leader in video recording. The Pro models have especially spearheaded their way with video features, such as ProRes, which allow professional-grade recording and post-production. However, Samsung may now be gearing up to challenge that dominance by introducing new video recording formats and potentially dethroning the iPhone 17 Pro . Samsung is expected to enable cinematic-grade video recording on the upcoming Galaxy S26 series. According to a report by SammyGuru , Samsung is planning to add support for the APV (Advanced Professional Video) codec , which enables recording near-lossless video quality with minimal pixelation, even without significantly increasing the video size .",
