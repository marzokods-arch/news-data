    "body": "TL;DR Leaked builds show Samsung’s next One UI 8.5 update, debuting with the Galaxy S26, will be based on Android 16’s second quarterly release (QPR2). This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence. We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The mod, although bulky and aesthetically unappealing, significantly improves the phone’s sustained performance beyond what Apple has already achieved with the move to vapor chambers. The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs. But what if you wanted even better performance with even more heat dissipation and cooling?

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

Recently, some Galaxy Watch owners have noticed their sleep scores rising through the stratosphere. With no obvious behavioral changes to blame, this may be due to a change in the sleep score algorithm. Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of. But are you sure you can trust that data? Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place.

    "body": "Credit: Megan Ellis / Android Authority TL;DR Google Maps could soon add a new “Aerial” button to Street View. The Aerial button will allow for a quick and seamless transition to Satellite View and back. The Aerial button even remembers the direction from Street View when transitioning into Satellite View, enhancing the user experience. Google Maps has a ton of great features that make it one of the best navigation apps on Android . One such feature is Street View, which presents users with images of the actual street and surroundings in mapped areas. Street View allows users to explore neighborhoods virtually, but there isn’t a clean method to seamlessly transition from Street View to Satellite View (which is also useful for virtual exploration). Google could soon solve this with a new Aerial button that lets users transition from Street View to Satellite View in a matter of seconds.
