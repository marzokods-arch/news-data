That’s according to music valuation firm Red Brick Advisors, which wrote in a newsletter this week that music finance insiders expect to see an increase in something called the loan-to-value ratio (LTV).&nbsp;&nbsp; LTV is the amount a borrower can get from a lender when using a music catalog as collateral. A decade ago, Red Brick noted, bank lenders’ upper bound on the LTV for music catalogs was 50% — meaning a lender will give a borrower up to 55% of the value of the catalog. The market was different back then: There were about five lenders that regularly financed music intellectual property, and lenders accepted as collateral seasoned music publishing catalogs.

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

The system stays online during outages thanks to cellular backup and a battery-powered hub. You purchase the equipment upfront (starting at $399), and the kits are designed for DIY installation. AT&amp;T is taking another big swing at the smart home, and this time it isn’t going in alone. After shutting down its Digital Life platform in 2022, the carrier is back with a new security and automation system built on Google’s smart-home ecosystem and Abode’s professional monitoring. The company has announced Connected Life, and the idea is straightforward: you get a home security system that keeps working even if your Wi-Fi goes out or the power fails. AT&amp;T includes cellular backup and a battery-powered hub, so the system stays on during outages.",

In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.

    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

Sometimes, it only takes the smallest change to how something works to really set us off. Earlier this year, Android users starting noticing an odd shift in the behavior of Google’s Phone app: It started supporting landscape mode , and would sometimes automatically switch over to it during calls. That’s not something any of us really asked for, and a horizontal Phone UI just felt all sorts of wrong to many of us who ran into it. The good news: You can finally disable it.

Anyone in the US who hasn’t received an invitation yet can now sign up for early access to get an invitation within 24 hours. Google is also enabling support for third-party speakers. Gemini first started trickling out to Google Home devices for early access users near the beginning of October. Since then, the early access rollout has slowly expanded to millions of households in the US. However, there are plenty of Google Home owners who are still waiting for their invite. If you’re in this camp, you won’t have to wait much longer to join the party. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

ANBERNIC has a new vertical handheld on the way called the RG 477V. We got our first official glimpse at the device through a reveal trailer published earlier this month. However, that reveal was spoiled by a November leak that not only showed off the design, but also offered some rumored specs. ANBERNIC has now officially shared the full specs of the RG 477V in a new video on its YouTube channel. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This feature uses the Miracast standard to extend your desktop to the phone’s 10-inch screen without requiring any cables. You can connect by opening the Second Screen page on the phone and pressing “Windows + K” on your PC to find the device. With the Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has finally delivered on the original promise of foldable phones : a device that truly transforms from a phone into a tablet. When folded, you interact with a standard 6.5-inch cover display, but unfolding it reveals a massive 10-inch screen. The inner display is so large, in fact, that the software treats it like a tablet, even enabling standalone Samsung DeX directly on the device. But the TriFold’s utility doesn’t end there: it can also function as a secondary monitor for your PC. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
