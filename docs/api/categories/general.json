    "body": "THE BIG STORY: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was so big that it has developed its own legal system. With a record-shattering haul of more than $2 billion face-value ticket sales — and many times that in the secondary market — it’s not surprising that legal disputes have broken out. Don’t forget the old adage in the music industry: “If you write a hit, you get a writ.” It started immediately after the chaotic pre-sale, when Swift fans filed class actions against Ticketmaster, accusing the company of causing the “disaster” rollout. In August, the Federal Trade Commission sued a ticket broker for allegedly using bots to buy thousands of Eras tickets that it resold for more than $1 million in profit. Just this month, an angry Swiftie sued StubHub for giving her “inferior” seats after she dropped $14,000 on Eras tickets. The latest fallout came last week in a criminal case — over a &#8220;cybercrime crew&#8221; that allegedly stole Eras tickets from StubHub and resold them for a windfall.

The change would reduce extra steps, making AI-powered object removal quicker and more accessible. Samsung hasn’t confirmed the rollout yet, so the final implementation may still change. If you’re ready to erase photobombers and stray objects with fewer taps, Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update might have you covered. Leaks suggest that the Object Eraser tool is now being integrated directly into the Generative Edit workflow in the Gallery app, meaning you’ll no longer have to switch between separate tools to get image-cleanup done.

The 26-year-old has continued to release music at a steady pace, dropping his second EP in 2024 and successfully holding his first headlining concert that year. His work as a songwriter has also earned high recognition, including contributions to the soundtracks of hit Korean drama series Welcome to Samdal-ri and Queen of Tears .

That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best foldable phones of 2025, and that’s largely due to its cutting-edge design. However, the Z Fold 7 retains a 4,400mAh battery for the fifth straight generation, while Samsung also nixed S Pen support. There might be good news for the Galaxy Z Fold 8, though. Dealsite (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could have a battery larger than 5,000mAh. This would be much bigger than the Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh battery.",

Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

The phone also loses Hasselblad branding, while the camera hardware could be a sidegrade. OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution.

    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority I moved into my new apartment a few months ago and wanted to set up a security camera for obvious reasons. The crime rate is going up, so I feel more comfortable knowing I’ll get a notification if someone walks into my home when I’m not there. I also generally like to check the live feed every now and then, making sure there aren’t any other issues while I’m away. My first impulse was to buy an indoor Nest Cam (3rd gen) . I’m already deep into Google’s ecosystem, using everything from Gmail and NotebookLM , to Photos and even Gemini . I also have a Pixel phone. I like Google’s products in general, so a Nest Cam seemed like the obvious choice.",

    "body": "I recently wrapped up my review of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold , and it’s a phone I found immensely frustrating. As a longtime Pixel user and a fan of folding phones, I’m the target audience for Google’s latest foldable. Google’s Pixel UI, exclusive software features, and reliable cameras in a folding form factor? That should be an easy win. Last year, it largely was. The year-over-year jump Google made from the first Pixel Fold to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still hard to believe to this very day. And compared to other foldables released in 2024, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold stood out as something special .",

Now, though, the SIM tray has become an endangered species, and I’m worried about growing pains. It still exists on Samsung’s Galaxy series and all of Motorola’s latest launches, but Apple and Google have started leaving it behind. As a reviewer, it’s starting to cause me all kinds of headaches, and something needs to change.",
