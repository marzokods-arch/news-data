TL;DR The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, is expanding its mandate against Android use for official purposes. According to reports from the Israeli media, IDF officers with ranks above Lieutenant Colonel are now banned from using Android phones. The IDF believes rival forces can install malware on Android devices to access troops’ locations or saved files. The never-ending Android vs iOS clash is taking a political turn with Israel now picking favorites. As the Gaza war wages for over two years, the Israeli administration is planning steps, it thinks, that might limit cybersecurity-related incidents. In this endeavor, Israel is planning to expand its restrictions on mobile phone use to senior officers beyond a certain rank, banning Android phones for official use.",

You can no longer buy collections, and you must download existing wallpapers before the app is removed. Users will receive automatic pro-rated refunds for active subscriptions, and the app code is promised to be open-sourced after shutdown. Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified . Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Marques has announced that Panels is shutting down. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

In the post, Siwa explained that she had been dealing with persistent discomfort for several days, which intensified any time she danced, walked or moved. “Every time that I’ve been dancing for the last couple of days or even just walking, my stomach would just really, really hurt,” she said. At first, she assumed the pain was related to menstrual cramps, adding that she tried to ease it with a warm bath. “That set it off 100 times worse,” she said. After calling her mother for advice, Siwa said she was urged to phone an ambulance. At the hospital, doctors told her the cause: “One of my ovaries had a cyst on it that burst and was bleeding into my stomach,” she explained. She added that the blood in her abdomen triggered the intense pain. “Anytime that the blood in your stomach moves, that’s the bleeding in the stomach. It’s like brutal pain.” Despite the medical emergency, Siwa still performed her …",

It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

    "body": "Credit: AssembleDebug / Android Authority TL;DR HONOR has announced a Smart Game Update Feature for its devices in China. The new feature automatically detects and downloads updated game files overnight while your phone is charging. We really hope the Play Store gains a similar feature, as it would address a major pain point for many mobile gamers. Mobile games have ballooned in size over the years, and it’s not uncommon to be greeted by large updates if you haven’t opened a game in a while. This isn’t great, as you’re forced to wait a while before starting a play session. Fortunately, one mobile manufacturer has come up with a smart solution, and I really hope the Google Play Store follows suit. HONOR has announced (h/t: IT Home ) that it now offers a so-called Smart Game Update Feature to make mobile game updates less of a chore.",

Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR One UI 8.5 might force dark-themed icons for all apps, giving the home screen a unified nighttime look. Samsung’s next update could also give app icons a subtle 3D redesign with drop shadows, appearing in both light and dark modes. This move aligns with a recent Google policy change that requires app developers to allow for automatic icon theming. Samsung’s next update may finally address one of the most persistent and overlooked issues with dark mode in recent years: app icons that never adapt to the nighttime theme. A recently surfaced One UI 8.5 leak provides the first substantial look at Samsung’s plan for addressing this issue, and it’s about time. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
