    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A malware, called “Sturus,” has emerged, and it exploits Android’s accessibility features to spread on your phone even without you noticing. It gains access to your Android after being installed via an APK file, and then monitors your phone’s interface, chats, and even button presses. It then recreates fake banking app UIs to steal your banking data, and places restrictions that prevent it from being uninstalled. Update, November 25, 2025 (11:27 AM ET): Google has reached out to Android Authority with a statement regarding the Sturnus malware. A spokesperson tells us: Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect , which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVyfNGZUns I’ve been dipping in and out of classic game emulation for years now, but one trend that I hadn’t really appreciated until recently was the use of “spoof” APK versions that you won’t find in the Google Play Store. In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving.

Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets.

These software updates brought exclusive features to Pixel phones, giving users more toys to play with than other Android users. However, as the November Pixel Drop came and went, the play chest was empty, save for a “feature” that’s annoying our Pixel users and many readers. My colleague Rita El Khoury received almost none of the new features on her Pixel 10 Pro and XL, except for the Wicked theme pack . Similarly, Joe Maring took issue with Google’s aggressive marketing, which paints a rather dim picture of future Pixel Drops and the infusion of advertising material within them.",

The devices secretly take automatic screenshots, restrict file access, and require government approval for installing even basic apps. Every part of the operating system is designed to monitor citizens, making personal computing virtually impossible. North Korea’s smartphones were never meant to be seen by the outside world, but in a rare deep dive, YouTuber MrWhosetheboss has exposed just how the region and its regime rig devices for surveillance, censorship, and propaganda.",

Perhaps I’m just having a worse time than most, undoubtedly due to the sheer number of gadgets on my desk at any given time, but plugging in my new OPPO Find X9 Pro had me pulling my hair out. It’s been a while since I’ve actually struggled to get a modern flagship to start fast charging. Like any normal person, I took my new Find X9 Pro out of the box and tried plugging it into my existing charger setup . That went OK, if not a little slow (more on that later). But I also wanted to compare my desk charger against an official 80W OPPO SuperVOOC plug, so I gave that a try as well. The phone wouldn’t charge at a rate above 22W-27W — far short of its claimed 80W charging potential.",

Smartphone prices have steadily risen over the past few years and the same is true for most other electronics, from headphones to consoles. Still, there are a few product categories like televisions that have managed to buck this trend. And over the past couple of weeks, I’ve found out that robot vacuums are another exception. Sure, you could spend thousands on a cutting-edge robot vacuum that can physically lift socks and other debris , but most people don’t need that. Even as someone who lives on the bleeding edge of tech, I’m perfectly content with a vacuum that just keeps my floors clean. And the good news is that robot vacuums have become shockingly accessible. But shopping for one is confusing: you’ll find a myriad of brands, some of which you might’ve never seen before, and model names that don’t make much sense.",

As a Pixel 8 user, I encounter the home screen’s quirks every day, but even so, its limitations can be leveraged to build a highly functional, productivity-first home screen environment. That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters. Not everyone values this information, though, and since At a Glance is permanent, it robs these users of real estate on their home screens.",
