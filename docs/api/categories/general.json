Are the hinges sturdy? How heavy/bulky is the phone? Is this folding design better or worse than the Huawei Mate XT? Well, we now have answers to all of those. My colleague Paul Jones recently went hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold at the Dubai Mall — one of the only places in the world where Samsung is demoing the phone — and he came away with a lot of thoughts about Samsung’s futuristic foldable.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Google is bringing a key Pixel 10 Pro Fold feature to the older Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature. Meanwhile, Google only added it to its foldable lineup recently with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , and the feature has been exclusive to it since launch. Thankfully, t…",

    "summary": "This tiny ultra-short-throw still delivers a 100-inch image from inches away.",
    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

Portable gaming hardware keeps getting more and more powerful, and the aptly-named Super X is here to bring desktop-level power to a two-in-one tablet design. It isn’t cheap, but it blows traditional devices like the Surface Pro out of the water. The OneXPlayer Super X packs up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 128GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful devices you can buy. It’s far from the only device with this chipset, but its killer feature is that it can transform between a tablet and a laptop. There’s a kickstand in the back, which, paired with the magnetic keyboard included with early bird purchases, turns it into a real portable powerhouse.",

With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features.

This feature uses the Miracast standard to extend your desktop to the phone’s 10-inch screen without requiring any cables. You can connect by opening the Second Screen page on the phone and pressing “Windows + K” on your PC to find the device. With the Galaxy Z TriFold , Samsung has finally delivered on the original promise of foldable phones : a device that truly transforms from a phone into a tablet. When folded, you interact with a standard 6.5-inch cover display, but unfolding it reveals a massive 10-inch screen. The inner display is so large, in fact, that the software treats it like a tablet, even enabling standalone Samsung DeX directly on the device. But the TriFold’s utility doesn’t end there: it can also function as a secondary monitor for your PC. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031.

Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade.
