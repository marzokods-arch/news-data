Speaking to the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast this week, Cowell described their final meeting and the conflicted feelings he&#8217;s struggled with in the time since about his role in thrusting the 31-year-old singer into global fame. &#8220;I saw him a year before this happened. He came over to my house. We talked about his son and being a dad,&#8221; Cowell said Cowell said in a Rolling Stone Music Now podcast (Payne talk begins at 40-minute mark) about their discussion of Liam&#8217;s now seven-year-old son, Bear, with former partner Cheryl Cole. &#8220;I remember saying, &#8216;Music is not everything, by the way.

Now, though, OnePlus has confirmed that another of its upcoming devices will debut a new Qualcomm chipset that better balances performance and trade-offs. OnePlus has shared that its OnePlus 15R, its “ultimate value flagship device,” will be the first phone released worldwide to feature the (non-Elite) Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. OnePlus says it worked with Qualcomm to design the 8 Gen 5 in a collaborative project that started in 2023.",

It’s unclear whether these phones will be available in markets like Europe, which have stringent regulations on battery capacity. We saw some notable battery advancements from the previous crop of Android phones , but the HONOR Power (seen above) stood out thanks to its 8,000mAh battery.

Google Phone and Contacts apps have already received a Material 3 Expressive treatment for their main UI elements.

When it comes to emulation, the experience often feels less like a console and more like a tedious series of menus and poorly labeled files. Emulation frontends like ES-DE and Beacon try to fix this, but none are as ambitious as iiSU. First revealed two months ago, a slick new video highlighting planned features was released yesterday.

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVyfNGZUns I’ve been dipping in and out of classic game emulation for years now, but one trend that I hadn’t really appreciated until recently was the use of “spoof” APK versions that you won’t find in the Google Play Store. In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling.

As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

On the other side of the coin, Google has also had weeks to gather feedback from users. Now the tech giant is rolling out fixes for some common issues.
