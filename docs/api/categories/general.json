    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

Instead, Geoff Keighley cued up a trailer for an unknown hero shooter called Highguard. It didn't go great. The social media reaction was instantly hostile. Highguard was received as a 'one more thing' trespasser that had claimed an unearned seat of honor, although its developer did not pay for the slot as many assumed. The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness. That cynicism-for-cynicism's-sake aside, it feels safe to say that general distrust of this kind of game is at an all-time high. In Highguard's case, you do get a whiff of hubris fro…",

Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is.

I smashed through Fallout 3 in a week and change over Christmas, I'm getting asymptotically close to the end of a New Vegas run I started in November, and I've put a humiliating number of hours (28.2, according to Steam) into Fallout 4 in just the past five days. My cold take: New Vegas is still my favorite entry in the series, including the 2D originals. My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas. This is actually the optimal settlement shape. (Image credit: Bethesda) That's not even getting to the settlement building stuff, which Fallou…",

The physics-based melee brawler is equal parts gore and clumsiness as players face off—and try to slash each other's faces off—with wildly-swung swords and axes and spears. Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history. Watch and listen for yourself: The trailer begins with some bare-fisted boxing, but that quickly escalates to people's faces being pulverised on the ground or against wooden posts. Then it moves on to combatants wonkily destroying each other's bodies with hammers, axes, and swords. But you've seen stu…",

While the fate of Ubisoft's many studios is the more pressing concern (including staff already going on strike), along with the threat of a pivot towards even more live service games and generative AI, a gamer-level problem is that one of Ubi's most iconic adventures exists in a surprisingly sorry state. Fortunately we're PC gaming nerds, and we know how to solve such problems. Where to buy Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time If you don't already own a modern digital copy of Sands Of Time, you've got a few options. The first and most convenient is Steam , where the game goes for around $12 (£9). At the time of writing, the Ubisoft Store has the game discounted down to under $3 (£2), although, yes, you'll have to download it through their app. You can launch it through Steam after doing so.

This new ROG Azoth 96 HE takes some of what Asus has built up to this point and tears it up. For instance, it's not mechanical in the same sense as its predecessors (or siblings, I suppose), as Asus has opted to go for its ROG HFX V2 Hall effect switches for gaming precision and power, rather than the increased tactility of a traditional mechanical switch. These have been upgraded over the older V1 switches kitted out to other Asus keyboards with Hall effect powers and were first seen on the Asus ROG Falcata , with optimisations such as a shorter overall travel (3.5 mm vs 4 mm) that's more noticeable in use than you'd think, plus a larger magnet for more precise customisation.

An unfair comparison considering the desktop chip doesn’t have to deal with the constrained thermal envelope and limited power draw of a laptop, and the 3D V-Cache really does make a difference. Despite the rainbow keyboard and presence of an RTX 5080 GPU, you’ll be surprised to hear this this isn’t a gaming laptop.

Yeah, man.

But, reaching an ugly peak in Forza Horizon 5, there's been a frustrating trend to carve away at that feeling of career progression in favour of more freedom. You could immediately take part in almost any event and get a supercar in minutes in FH5. In fact, you could easily have a whole garage of supercars in no time—for free—thanks to the Wheelspin system. Not exactly what I'd call a career mode, and it quickly diminished any satisfaction from performing well to earn money and save up for your first fancy ride. This leads me to the one line from Xbox's recent Developer Direct , which finally opened the hood on Forza Horizon 6 , that instantly brought me on board: Torben Ellert, design director of FH6, said, \"You'll start out as just a tourist in Japan.\" Ellert explains that \"your first goal is to join the Horizon Festival by completing the Horizon qualifiers.

It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion I think is really clear these days.\" I would argue that the idea there's no objective evil in the world is maybe a bit much—there's plenty of ways we're all horrible to each other that aren't really up for interpretation.

I purchased the Peerless Assassin 120 SE V2, a version of the cooler with six heatpipes, for £26. It's currently $33 on Amazon US . Thermalright has around 40,000 variants of any one cooler, all with names using a combination of around ten words, and spanning nine pages on its website . I opted for one of the cheapest available at the time, but if you wanted something prettier, there are many more to choose from. It arrived in a nondescript brown cardboard box, which slightly tempered my expectations for the cooler within. Though I shouldn't have judge a cooler by its box here; it's a mighty impressive unit once you remove it from the packaging. It's much larger than the other budget options I've reviewed recently, including the Arctic Freezer 36 and Cooler Master Hyper 212 Pro . It's a dual-tower cooler, one…",

However, Secure Boot, as shown with the launch of Battlefield 6 , tends to draw criticism. That's for three major reasons. The first is that Secure Boot is a kernel-level security measure, and anti-cheat software that uses it will effectively get privileged access to the inner sanctuary of your PC. Secondly, older machines may not support Secure Boot or might not even have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store cryptographic keys. This means older machines are left in the dust.

    "body": "Imagine that you'd just bought a new Ryzen 7 9800X3D , the best gaming CPU around right now. You drop it into your AM5 socket motherboard and start enjoying the freshly boosted frame rates. After a while, you then start experiencing all kinds of problems, until eventually your gaming PC no longer fires up: the CPU is dead. That's happened to some owners of ASRock motherboards, but it's also apparently occurring with Asus models, and the company has launched an investigation into it all. In the case of the whole ASRock thing, the company was arguably a bit dismissive of the whole problem to begin with , before admitting that the BIOS on certain motherboards was allowing too much current to be drawn by the CPU in specific scenarios. A little while afterwards, AMD itself stated that \"this issue arises because some ODM (original design manufacturer) BIOSes do not adhere to AMD's recommended values .\" However, Ryzen chip failures haven't been exclusive to ASRock motherboards, and there have been reports of issues with models from all the key manufacturers: Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte. Without a detailed investigation into every single case, though, you just can't point the finger at these …",

    "body": "Nova Lake, the next-generation of Core processor, is set to launch at the end of the year. That's no surprise, but with the ongoing memory crisis making upgrading your processor and motherboard a very expensive ordeal, we had worried for both Intel and AMD's forthcoming generations. In Intel's Q4 earnings call, the company's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, confirmed the upcoming release window for Nova Lake: \"Along with our next-generation Nova Lake coming at the end of 2026. We now have a client roadmap that combines best-in-class performance with cost-optimized solutions giving me confidence that we are on the path of 45% market share and profitability in both notebooks and desktops over the next several years,\" Tan said (transcript via SeekingAlpha ) Nova Lake could be a big improvement over Arrow lake. I'm not getting my hopes up just yet, but it's rumoured to include a big last level cache (literally called bLLC) that will act as an analogue to 3D V-Cache on AMD Ryzen chips. Moreover, VP John Pitzer said he thought Intel would hold a leadership position with the launch of Nova Lake . Though Intel will have to produce a very strong chip to both catch up to AMD's dominant X3D lineup and convi…",
