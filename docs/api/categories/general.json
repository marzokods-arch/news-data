If anything, Eilish&#8217;s marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don&#8217;t Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration &#8220;Guess&#8221; with impressive stamina and musicality.

Part of the NYRP’s fundraising arm is its annual Hulaween gala, an explosion of costumed creativity that took over Manhattan’s Cipriani South Street on Friday (Oct. 24) night to mark 30 years of the Tony-, Grammy-, Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning icon&#8217;s nonprofit.
