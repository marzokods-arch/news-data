We humans can’t seem to settle the score, so perhaps AI can do it for us. On paper, Gemini should be more pro-Android since it’s owned by Google, while ChatGPT seems more like an Apple fanboy since it runs AI on iPhones. This got me thinking: what would happen if the two started an argument about which OS is better? How long would the conversation take between the two, what kind of arguments would they make, and would they even come to a conclusion at the end and crown one as the ultimate winner?",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

NotebookLM is also teasing British English narration voices planned for 2026, with an early easter egg already live in a Featured Notebook. As much as we admire NotebookLM , Google isn’t resting on its laurels and continues to tweak the AI app. The latest feature in testing looks to be a new “Lecture” format for Audio Overviews in NotebookLM, and there may also be a British twist on the way. Instead of two AI hosts chatting things through, Lecture appears to stick to a single narrator delivering a continuous, lecture-style explanation that can run for up to half an hour. According to TestingCatalog , which appears to have enabled the feature in a teardown of the app, the Lecture option shows up alongside existing Audio Overview formats , such as Deep Dive, Brief, Critique, and Debate.",

Leaked information suggests that the rotary mechanism may adjust optically variable zoom levels and includes aesthetic cues, such as custom watermarks and red Leica engraving. Xiaomi is gearing up to launch the Xiaomi 17 Ultra flagship on December 25, promising great specifications for its top-of-the-line smartphone experience.

The same hardware used to adjust focus with professional cameras could be used with Galaxy phones. Samsung may initially feature this support with Galaxy S26 phones. Samsung just took home our Reader’s Choice award for the best phone of 2025 with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but will it be able to repeat that success next year? Even with Samsung’s launches still a couple months away, some of us have already been souring on the idea of the Galaxy S26 lineup , worried that Samsung’s gotten too complacent, and isn’t doing enough to keep things feeling fresh. Those concerns extend to the phones’ cameras, but even if we don’t get a big upgrade to camera hardware, we’re still spotting a few improvements on the horizon for Samsung’s camera software.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung released its second One UI 8.5 beta build today. The new beta restores Single Take and Dual Rec, two camera features that were missing in the previous build. Single Take and Dual Rec can be reenabled through the Camera Assistant app. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta that dropped earlier this month introduces plenty of small quality-of-life improvements , but mobile photography buffs weren’t pleased to see that it also removed a couple of niche camera app features, Single Take and Dual Rec. A second One UI 8.5 beta released today brings those features back, but makes them a little harder to access than they were before. SamMobile reports that the Single Take and Dual Rec camera modes are accessible in the second One UI 8.5 beta via the latest version of Samsung’s Camera Assistant app. Prior to One UI 8.5, the two modes were baked into Galaxy phones’ standard camera app.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Eden v0.0.4 arrives with a focus on smoother performance, fewer bugs, and cleaner day-to-day use. An experimental Switch-style overlay menu and improved graphics handling stand out in the update. Android, macOS, and less common devices, such as Chromebooks, now receive better or expanded support. The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos has new search shortcuts to people and pets on Android and iOS. The new option requires having the Face Groups feature enabled. We previously saw that this feature was in development in July, and it’s now rolling out broadly. Google’s made it even easier to find pictures of people in the Google Photos app. Photos has always offered an optional feature called Face Groups that groups similar faces together, creating automatically updating albums of all your pictures of any given person or pet, and today, Google announced that that feature is being more directly integrated into the app’s search functions. The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet. We first caught a glimpse of this feature in an APK teardown back in July, and today, the change seems to be rolling out broadly.",

As part of the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 update, the Pixel 10 now runs Imagination’s 1.634.2906 driver version, bringing with it Vulkan 1.4 support and a selection of other improvements. So why does this matter? We previously noted that the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s gaming performance was fine but certainly not on the cutting edge, as you might expect from a $1,199 flagship. In fact, last year’s Pixel 9 Pro XL easily outperformed it in a series of emulation tests , suggesting that Google’s choice of a DXT-48-1536 GPU inside the Tensor G5 chip might have backfired.",
