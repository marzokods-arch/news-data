It wasn’t just the premium choice, it was the safe choice, and frankly, the only choice that made sense if you needed a solid balance of hardware and software. But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon is launching its Fig colorway for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft on January 28, 2026. The new finish applies to the front-lit Colorsoft model, available in 32GB and 64GB configurations. This is a design update only, with no changes to hardware, specs, or features. Good news for anyone who wants a Kindle Scribe Colorsoft that’s a little more colorful. Amazon’s largest note-taking e-reader will soon be available in Fig, a warm berry-toned color that lands somewhere between plum and deep cranberry. It’s a fairly refined colorway that offers a little more personality than the standard Graphite without being overly bold. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft first debuted in the US on December 10, 2025, introducing Amazon’s latest generation of the Scribe lineup with an 11-inch color E Ink display, adjustable front light, and improved performance. Since launch, the Colorsoft model has been available in a single utilitarian gray (Graphite) from Amazon and major retailers.",

While Verizon has recently started offering free lines more often , traditionally, it is T-Mobile that is best known for semi-regularly offering deals on free lines. Back in December, it began offering free lines to select account holders with specific plans . While this deal has since ended, the first BOGO offer of 2026 has now arrived.

The new look also adds a Gemini sidebar that can suggest and analyze search term performance based on a broader topic. Google’s upgraded Trends Explore page is starting to roll out now for desktop users, but the gradual rollout could take weeks to reach everyone. Google Search data is paramount in determining what topics, people, and questions users find important . Google hosts a tool called Google Trends that anyone can use to discover the search queries and topics that are currently trending. It’s especially useful for researchers, content creators, and journalists, but there are a handful of ways the average Google user can tap into these metrics, too. Google announced today, January 14, that it is redesigning the Trends Explore page — and the new look adds a Gemini sidebar for the first time. The upgraded Trends Explore page uses Gemini to help users compare data across multiple related search terms. Instead of combing through similar search queries manually, users can have Gemini identify and compare topical trends. These are compiled automatically based on you…",

Verizon is experiencing a significant outage today, with thousands of users from across the country taking to service availability monitor Downdetector to report that their Verizon service isn’t working. It isn’t just Verizon getting reports, though: AT&amp;T and T-Mobile ‘s outage reports on Downdetector spiked at the same time, along with some other non-carrier online services like Amazon Web Services and Google . Downdetector’s outage report graphs for T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Google, US Cellular, Amazon Web Services, and more all spiked at the same time as Verizon’s, starting just before noon Eastern time today. Reports of Verizon outages far outweighed reports for other services, however: Verizon saw nearly 200,000 reports at the peak of the outage around 12:30 PM, Eastern, while T-Mobile and AT&amp;T each had less than 2,000 reports around the same time.",

The game is an origami simulator called “Kami.” The project is free, available online, and it’s open-source, so anyone can use or modify it. With the extra screen real estate that foldable phones, like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 , provide, they make for great mobile gaming devices. The unique folding design of foldables also presents an opportunity to interact with games in a new way. On that end, we’re starting to see developers find ways to incorporate a folding phone’s hinge into the gameplay, like the viral Foldy Bird game . Now, another game has emerged with a rather clever idea. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Elite model is still on track to begin shipping in March, as per the delayed schedule. As compensation for the wait, AYANEO is offering a $15 store coupon to all buyers, plus an accessory bundle for Elite backers. Android gaming handheld launches have been feeling fragile lately, with rising memory costs and shortages largely to blame. It’s no minor issue, with a new update from AYANEO shedding a worrying light on just how bad that problem has become. In the case of the KONKR Pocket FIT Elite, the company says memory prices nearly tripled, causing AYANEO to lose money on the device. In a detailed post on Indiegogo , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket FIT Elite is still expected to begin shipping in March after the Chinese New Year shutdowns. While that timeline broadly matches what the company said in late December , the update goes much further by explaining exactly why the Elite model ran into trouble in the first place.",
