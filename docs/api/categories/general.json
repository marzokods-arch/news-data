It seems to be paying off, as developer Moon Studios announced Thursday that the game has moved one million copies on Steam in early access, though it is about to share at least one thing in common with Diablo: 4-player co-op . The co-op announcement comes with a lavish trailer showing the feature off, and states it will launch Jan. 22. I haven't tried the game myself yet in solo play or otherwise, but seeing a gaggle of heroes take on a huge boss together certainly makes it pop. The game's model for co-op, which was detailed in a lengthy explainer video from Moon Studios in Dec. 2025, is \"similar to how realms work in Minecraft, the only difference being you don't have to pay for a subscription.\" What that means is that rather than Dark Souls invasions, Diablo 4's quasi-MMO open world, or other ARPGs' multiplayer systems where a single player's save file is used, No Rest for the Wicked will distinguish between persistent multiplayer saves and offline single-player saves.

Hence, when I plucked a star-shaped object off a door and my inventory labelled it as \"food?\" as it does with everything, down it went, costing me two points of health and any chance of knowing where north is.

MMORPGs are monstrously complicated things—they run on huge, easily DDOSable servers, they have economies that can easily get knocked off the rails, are designed to run for decades, and require constant balancing and fine-tuning. If you work on an MMO, you are Sisyphus trying to get a boulder up a hill, except you also have a bunch of angry forum users calling you an idiot the whole way up. Part of my job is understanding these complicated machines, and as I look at games in 2026, I'm starting to notice a trend that's really come to a head in these past few years: The main existential threat to MMORPGs of the modern era is getting the dang difficulty right.

Both games are pretty good sneak-a-thons, worthy of respect simply for how seriously they take stealth. While Styx can technically fight enemies face to face, he is utterly terrible at it and will almost certainly get killed. Hence, evasion, trickery, and shanking guards in the back are the best ways to progress. Master of Shadows set the template for Cyanide, in which Styx embarks on a series of infiltration and assassination missions across extravagant fantasy locations.

The sequel, Brigador Killers, has been in development for ages, which surprised me as I assumed it was just Brigador on a larger scale. But Stellar Jockeys recently released some new footage of the game, which shows it is a very different affair from the original, almost like a mix of Syndicate and OG Grand Theft Auto. As it turns out, that isn't far off Stellar Jockeys' own summary of the experience, with the dev having previously described it as \"Hitman: Contracts meets GTA2\". The main difference is that Brigador was a dedicated mech shooter, whereas Brigador Killers lets players explore missions on foot.

Then in December, I checked out Everything is Crab , a clever roguelike that turned out to realise some of that game's lost potential. Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\". It's not quite 1:1—rather than an early single-celled organism swimming through the primordial goop, you're a microscopic parasite invading a human body. But it embraces the same idea of evolution and customisation, to so far pretty impressive results. (Image credit: Aberrant Labs) The action plays out like a twin-stick shooter, my parasite's undulating \"secretors\" functioning as guns and my host's aggressive antibodies serving as the enemies. Combat is agreeably slick, in both senses of the word—piloting my tiny creature around is responsive and satisfying, but also has a swimmy, organi…",

Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband.

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way.
