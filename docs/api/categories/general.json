The reimagined track marks the first time the Pumpkins have appeared on another artist’s recording, a notable moment in the band’s three-decade career. Originally released as part of Yungblud’s fourth studio album Idols , “Zombie” has become the British rocker’s fastest-streaming solo single to date, surpassing 100 million global streams. The song is nominated for best rock song at the 2026 Grammy Awards, while Idols is also nominated for best rock album. The updated version retains the emotional core of the original recording while leaning into a darker, heavier sound. Yungblud opens the track with the familiar first verse and chorus before Billy Corgan enters on the second verse,. The new arrangement features denser guitar layers and a more foreboding atmosphere, amplifying the song’s themes of trauma, grief and emotional isolation. In a recent interview with interview with Loudwire , Yungblud revealed that Siamese Dream was a key reference point while writing “Zombie.” “When I was making ‘Zombie,’ I was really channeling Siamese Dream ,”…",
