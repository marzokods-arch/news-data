Don't believe me?

Oh, hang on, it also sports vapor-chamber cooling for its CPU and GPU, the performance upgrades are kind of incremental this time around, but the price has still gone up. See what I mean? That's the pitch for a new gaming PC or laptop. It's probably that new vapor-chamber cooling that's most eye catching. It's not a first for a smartphone, but when Apple sticks a technology into one of its devices, you know it's gone totally mainstream.

    "body": "Roughly two months ago we got our first look at the system requirements for Borderlands 4 , a process that involved many of us on the hardware team scrunching up our noses. Listed on the Steam page was the insistence that the game would require eight CPU cores as a minimum, which seemed highly unlikely given how many speedy six core processors there are on the market. So much so, in fact, that our Jeremy theorised that what the devs likely meant is it would require a CPU with a minimum of eight software threads, which even an ancient four-core CPU with multi-threading support would technically cover. Well, the specs have now been updated on the community page , and they look identical—save for one note. (Image credit: Gearbox) Next to the same eight-core minimum CPU requirement is an asterisk, and that asterisk points to the phrase \"or equivalent.\" Which means... I'm not entirely sure. Again, the temptation is to think that we're likely talking about thread requirements again here, although an eight-thread CPU is not equivalent to an eight-core model. In fact, not even close. Taking a look at those CPU minimums once more, we've got the Intel Core i7 9700 and the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X …",

You could use a different panel and still get 75 Hz.\" Commonly referred to as e-paper, electrophoretic displays manipulate electric fields in order to move differently-coloured charged particles suspended within a clear fluid, resulting in a series of ink-on-paper-like images displayed onscreen.

Where all other areas have clear routes and maps, The Mist is ever-shifting and changes structure each time you venture in. You'll have to contend with silk-stealing ghosts, traps galore, and tricky platforming to make it to the other side—that's not even mentioning the one trick you'll need to actually navigate the region. Just to be 100% clear, The Mist has no map . You can enter it via both Bilewater, to the left of the Bellway there, or through the top of Sinner's Road, but either way, you won't be getting a map. That said, the surprise on the other side is well worth it if you're up for the challenge. Here's how to navigate The Mist in Silksong and also kill the pesky ghost enemies who dog your progress. How to find a way through The Mist in Silksong There's one important trick to finding a route through The Mist, and that's the little golden moths you spot floating in each area. Play these moths your Needolin for a couple of seconds and they will direct you towards the entrance you need to take .

Still, for now, here are some tips to take down this Shellwood granny, including some handy clips for illustrative purposes. How to beat Sister Splinter in Silksong There are two main things that make Sister Splinter a bit tricky and those are: The spiky roots she periodically summons throughout the fight.

But the same can't be said for all the other studios releasing games in and around the next year.

When the kids come to your farmhouse, they will basically demand a sweet treat before leaving, so you'll want to bake a number of goodies ahead of time to prevent disappointing anyone. It's also worth noting that the kids will enter the farm before talking to you, but if you give them any desserts before t…",

Until next year, that is, and the launch of Nova Lake . That's right, peeps, when Intel's next-gen CPU architecture arrives at the end of 2026, Intel will ascend to a leadership position across the board on desktop. To quote John Pitzer, Intel's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations, precisely , \"as Nova Lake comes out at the end of next year into 2027, I think we're going to have a leadership position across the board on desktop.\" That is one heck of a bold claim, even for a chip that's rumoured to pack up to 52 cores . Of course, it will at least in part hinge on the quality of Intel's upcoming 18A process, the node formerly known as the one upon which Pat Gelsinger bet the entire company, but latterly more of a stepping stone back to profitability, with 14A being the node on which Intel's hopes to build chips for customers now depends on . Unsurprisingly, Pitzer is bullish on 18A, too. He says Intel is planning to spend heavily on tooling up to produce lots of chips on 18A and return Intel t…",

A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups.

    "body": "This weekend saw disruptions to Microsoft's Azure Cloud services after cables in the Red Sea responsible for internet connectivity were found to be damaged. The company released a status warning explaining that while it has managed to redirect traffic any traffic going through the Middle East will experience delays in service until the cut cables can be repaired. With Azure being one of the biggest cloud service providers around, the latency issues are sure to affect a large number of people and corporations. So far reports have indicated places such as the United Arab Emirates as well as parts of Asia have been experiencing delays since the damage. There's currently no word on how long it will take to resolve the problem. \"We do expect higher latency on some traffic that previously traversed through the Middle East until the undersea fiber cuts are fully addressed. Network traffic that does not traverse through the Middle East is not impacted,\" Microsoft says on the Azure status website . The cause of the damage to the cables hasn't been stated, merely that they've been cut. This could mean they were damaged by boat anchors or natural causes, but many are speculating that it coul…",

    "body": "If it's been a minute since you drove your trusty patchwork station wagon through Pacific Drive's exclusion zone, here's a great reason to gas up for another run. The driving survival game is getting its first major expansion, called Whispers in the Woods, and as you can see in the trailer above, it's spooky as heck. While you spent your time in Pacific Drive fleeing all those mysterious anomalies in the exclusion zone, it makes a certain amount of sense that other people would be drawn to them. That's what this expansion is about: there's a bunch of weirdos who are really into all that bizarre stuff going on in the woods. \"Witness the rise of a group of Anomaly-obsessed fanatics in this terrifying expansion to Pacific Drive,\" says Ironwood Studios, which \"takes you deep within a strange and mysterious part of the Olympic Exclusion Zone’s forests. Marked with strange symbols and effigies, these woods are filled with new dangers and mysteries to uncover.\" Last week, PC Gamer spoke to Cassandra Dracott, Ironwood Studios founder, CEO and creative director, to find out a bit more about Whispers in the Woods, the decision to steer the expansion into horror, and what new oddities and fe…",

    "body": "Tackling the Great Taste of Pharloom quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is likely one of the most involved quests you'll pursue in the game. Feeding Loyal Mergwin's master in the Choral Chambers' dining hall requires you to collect five unique items from throughout the kingdom, which, in turn, means you'll have to explore extensively and acquire most of the game's movement abilities. You'll need both the Clawline and Faydown Cloak to grab the Crustnut and the Pickled Muckmaggot, not to mention that those abilities will help a lot when delivering the Courier's Rasher, on foot, to the dining hall and Loyal Mergwin. Here, I'll explain where to find each item in the Great Taste of Pharloom quest, and I've also included a video of my Courier's Rasher route so you know which way to go. Silksong Mossberry Stew location You can get the Mossberry Stew from the Moss Druid, though you likely have to complete her Berrypicking quest (Image credit: Team Cherry) The first one is always the simplest. To collect Mossberry stew, you simply have to go to see the Moss Druid who lives in Mosshome above Bone Bottom (accessible via The Marrow).

The Pocket Scion seems to have fallen from the pages of a sci-fi novel, except its functionality is arguably even cooler. This cryptically-designed device responds to small changes in bioelectricity generated by natural organisms, like plants, fungi, or even your good self, then plays back the input as music through four built-in, synthesised instruments. Essentially, you attach two cable-connected sensors to your nearest living organism (please ask for consent first), plug in some headphones, and, like, chill out to the sonic vibes, man (via The Verge ) . As demonstrated below by its co-creator, TikTok superstar Modern Biology , who seems to have taken to wandering around the forest in their pyjamas with the device in hand. Groovy. Actually, Modern Biology is something of a modern social media sensation, after posting videos of themselves plugging a modular synth into mushrooms and jamming with the response. They've since teamed up with Glasgow-based synthesiser manufacturer Instruo to create the Pocket Scion, and I have to admit, it looks like they've nailed the design. Yo…",

It's not that I'm averse to gaming handhelds—I won't tell you how many hours I've put into getting humbled by Dungeon Encounters on the original Nintendo Switch. So why have I fallen out with the Steam Deck? Especially when my colleagues are enjoying their best cozy gaming, Tiny Bookshop life with the handheld ? Well, it all comes down to my biggest ask for the Steam Deck's successor: Please Valve, make the Steam Deck 2 just a little more comfortable for my teeny tiny raccoon hands. Now, I know what you may be thinking—'sounds like a skill issue,' 'shouldn't have skipped arm day,' 'get outta here you weird baby-handed freak,' and so on. But when it comes to gaming handhelds, the original Steam Deck stands out as an especially beefy boy. It's not just the bulky shape but, at 1.48 lbs (or 673 grams), the weight of it too. For some sleeker points of comparison, the original Nintendo Switch weighs 0.88 lbs (or 398 g) while the Switch 2 weighs 1.18 lb…",

If, like me, you forged one hunting sword throughout your entire run of the main game and mainly acquired your gear via good old-fashioned theft and bandit brutality, you might need a few reminders. The guild trial consists of a theory test where you'll get asked a few questions, and then a forging test where you have to make a blacksmiths' guild longsword of a decent quality. I'll run through all potential question answers below, as well as a step-by-step for forging a longsword that'll pass the exam. All guild trial answers in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (Image credit: Warhorse Studios) As the first step of the test to become an accredited guild blacksmith, you'll be asked three random questions . If you get any of them wrong, you'll fail the theory section of the test, and that means you'll have to forge a much better weapon to be in with a chance. It's worth noting that even though you can pay money to retry the blade forging, you only get one shot at answering the questions (unless you load a save that is)…",
