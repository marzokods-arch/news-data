It's a big year for Phas as the horror rework and lore updates coupled with 1.0's debut are one of several major patches outlined. There's also a Unity 6 and network update on the roadmap that I hope will fix some of the frustrating connection issues I occasionally run into, and the long-awaited player character overhaul launches soon. I'm stoked to finally show up to the function (hopefully) not wearing the same thing as three of my friends. And by wearing the same thing, I mean all playing as the exact same guy with no way of knowing who's who. Anyway, as is Phasmophobia tradition, the Kinetic team is pretty hush-hush about the finer details around big patch plans, keeping things scarier for all of us come launch day.

If you feel the same, it sounds like a great time to dive into Fallout 76 because it's completely free to play from now until February 5, which will carry you through to the Fallout Season 2 finale next week. If you want to wear that dope NCR power armor from the show in Fallout 76, though—that ain't free. That ain't even close to free. The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle , which includes that tasty NCR armor skin, a Legion Legate outfit, an NCR flag and neon New Vegas sign, a fancy lookin' new super sledge, and a few other odds and ends, will run you $30 USD.

You might be curious what's new in this new version, or when it will be out, and I'm sorry to say I can't help. A message posted to the Final Fantasy 7 account on X says \"the original Final Fantasy 7 will be re‑released on Steam to provide an improved gameplay experience,\" and directs readers to an announcement on Steam for \"full details.\" And there definitely are more details, although calling it \"full\" is a stretch. The existing game will be renamed to Final Fantasy 7 - 2013 Edition when the new version launches. Existing owners will have access to both versions, but the original will no longer be available for purchase. Save data will not be compatible: 2013 saves won't work in the new release, and vice versa, so if you want to jump into the new one you'll be starting from scratch. And... that's it. What's changed?

    "body": "When it came time to choose my personal pick in our 2025 Game of the Year awards, one game jumped right out at me. Absolum is a brilliantly clever hybrid of classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up combat with a roguelike framework, and I'm not sure it ever quite got the buzz it deserved. It seems like it found an audience, at least, with 500,000 players , a 94% positive rating on Steam and apparently enough success to fuel a new free update . Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Arriving on February 12, the 1.1 patch will make further tweaks and fixes, but more importantly add a raft of new content to give the experience even more replayability. \"Mystic Ordeals\" are customisable modifiers you can apply to runs after you've beaten the final boss, so you can keep testing your skills. And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process. The update's also adding elite mounts—rarer versions with upgraded attacks—as well as new emotes for co-op play and unlockable character skins. …",

You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements. That's per the dev's \"State of Azeroth\" video released today, which you can view below: In it, Blizzard revealed a few key improvements they're working on for player housing—for example, letting your pets run amok indoors, or hitching \"a couple of your favourite mounts up in your yard outdoors\". But the real juice is in expanding the current tools to be even more powerful than they currently are, as director Ion Hazzikostas explains: \"We've also seen and heard that as you're expressing that boundless creativity, and maybe making something like, say, a grand piano that you've cobbled together from a dozen different decor pieces, it can be frustrating when you realise that you have your grand creation, but it's not quite in the spot you want it to be in.\" In t…",

This one has guns and a motorbike , mind you, so it's probably the greatest videogame ever made. As a PC Gamer reader of taste who probably arrived here by Googling something like \"so when's Code Vein 2 coming out then,\" you'll probably want to know when Code Vein 2 is coming out, then. I've collated the game's launch times across multiple regions below, so you can know exactly when you can start veining. When does Code Vein 2 launch? (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Code Vein 2 launches at 3 pm PST on January 29 , giving California a good window to get it downloading while it's still at work. Of course, if you got the pricey deluxe edition, then it actually unlocked for you three full days before that time and date, in which case what are you doing here?

That was the case even after Team Ninja apologized for their previous game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, running like crap on PC . If you cast your mind back five years ago, Nioh 2 also had a less-than-ideal launch. Ninja Gaiden 4 ran decently by all reports, but the settings options left a lot to be desired . I'm not here to give a full performance run down of Nioh 3, but I've just spent a couple of hours running around in its newly released demo and I can confirm that I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works on my aging game laptop. It's far from a disaster!

It was basically all over for my free time from then on. Which is why it's wild, more than a decade later, to be reminded of Atom Zombie Smasher's existence by it being patched. This 15th anniversary update isn't going to transform the top-down rescue sim where the zombies are tiny pink squares into The Last of Us 3, but it does add a horde of little changes. For starters, where before you could slow time down to 10%, now you can drop it all the way down to 1%. That's so slow you're basically making Atom Zombie Smasher turn-based, a change I approve of in any tactics game. Also changed: you can deselect units with the Escape key; the seams around cutscene vignette art are gone; and when you're on the Behind the Scenes screen the scroll limit works so you don't scroll too far and end up looking at the game as it would be seen from a passing aeroplane.

In the history of the series this character has been critical to world events, yet we've never seen their face, not even in a picture. The show had every chance to continue the tradition by, say, just showing them in silhouette or by obscuring their face, but nope!

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",
