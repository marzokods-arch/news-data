It was at least the fifth time in the interview that Nadella said the word \"innovation,\" though at no point did an idea of any specificity precede or follow it. While most of the interview bounced between incomprehensible AI talk and variations on 'Microsoft's Azure servers make a shitload of money,' when it came to gaming Nadella didn't seem to have much new to say, though what he did say he said with inspiring confidence: \"Most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent, maybe, some new interactive media as well.

Considering that Vampire Survivors was one of the first games featured in Balatro's first Friends of Jimbo update —a collaboration that both games have followed with more crossovers than I'm willing to count—it's only fitting that Jimbo would return the favor for the update that makes Vampire Survivors more of a communal experience than ever before. Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage. To start unlocking Ante Chamber content, you'll need to purchase the Joker Disk relic in the Moongolow stage for 50,000 gold. If you play a lot of Vampire Survivors, you might already have tha…",

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week . While most software is written in higher level programming languages like C++ that are easier to work with, even at a young age zsKnight was skilled enough in low level assembly language to start using it to program his own emulator.

So I was genuinely excited to learn today that a sequel, Darkwood 2, is now in development. This does not represent a comeback for original Darkwood developer Acid Wizard Studio, however: It remains in a state of long-term hiatus, which it embarked on in 2023 immediately after releasing an alpha for Soccer Kids, \"a game about soccer made by people who suck at playing soccer.\" Darkwood 2 is instead being made by Ice-Pick Lodge, the team best known for the Pathologic games.

A new trailer points to an 11am ET in-game event—the servers will then go down for several hours before the Simpsons mini-season starts around 5pm ET. In the trailer the drooling aliens Kang and Kodos—who have also flown next to the Fortnite Battle Bus in recent days—hover over a wasteland blasting their lasers before beaming two players skywards. Expect to see something similar during the in-game event: we know thanks to leaks that the Simpsons collab will have its own standalone map, which means leaving Oninoshima, Chapter 6's island. Bart's treehouse will likely star in the event too. It appeared in the top-left corner of the map near Creepy Camps a few days ago, sprouting from a sapling, and yesterday a glowing countdown timer appeared for Saturday's event. You can vault into the treehouse to find a crackling TV that flashes pictures from the show.

Whether it's a sniper built for maximum ranged effectiveness or your favourite assault rifle, you can't go wrong with a custom class.

A floating skateboard, and plenty of other mobility (Image credit: Epic Games) This season started with limited mobility—now, between shockwaves, the witch's broom, Crash Pads and the Last Call knife we've got loads, and that variety feels fantastic.

Yes, the HyperFlux V2 looks and feels great, and it does its job, but it's very expensive at $120. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's talk about what that job is.

Being free-to-play, Redsec is available as a separate download on all platforms, but if you already own Battlefield 6, then you'll be able to boot it from the main menu. Hopefully this makes having two separate but inextricably linked games slightly less annoying and confusing for everyone, though only time will tell. Moving on to the main course, overall account progression is unified between both Battlefield 6 and Redsec, though there are challenges specific to each one.

    "body": "It's said that a good thing never dies. Chip giant AMD certainly thinks so because earlier this month, it stealthily launched two new series of Ryzen processors. Except they're not exactly new, as the chips are simply old laptop-based ones from 2017 and 2022 that have been given a fresh lick of paint, new names, and the odd tweaked clock speed. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. Kicking off AMD's new-but-not-new CPUs is the very small Ryzen 10 series, comprising just two models (thanks to Olrak29_ on X for the heads-up). Despite one being a Ryzen 3 and the other a Ryzen 5, they're virtually identical, separated only by base and boost clock speeds. As the table below shows, these are based on the Zen 2 architecture (which launched in 2019), but they're not new designs, as they're simply rebadged Mendocino laptop processors from 2022.

    "body": "At first glance Realm of Ink looks like a flagrant Hades clone. Look closer, squint, and yes, it still looks like a flagrant Hades clone. But after a half-dozen hours spent with this China-developed roguelite, some of its more bonkers qualities shone through, such as the flexibility of its pet system, and the fact that depending on the build you stumble into, it can turn into something more akin to Vampire Survivors. This thing can get wildly broken, unashamedly so. The kind of broken where at some point the graphics surrender and let themselves be buried beneath overlapping damage numbers. That's what I like about it. Realm of Ink is set inside fictional books, hence the name. Most of the people and creatures you encounter don't know they're fictional entities, which could be why the voice acting is so bizarrely over-the-top, making your average Tales dub seem artful and restrained. I have to confess I quickly zoned out on the story, though the meticulously illustrated worlds kept my interest. These are far less elaborately animated compared to Hades, but they feel more distinctive. They're dreamy in their picture book woodenness, and the varying themes and color palettes all dra…",

EA is still being coy about the details, but what little else we know about Redsec has been gleaned from leaked playtests and the studio's own communications. We know it'll take place on a map set in California, feature the series' signature destruction and vehicles, and that its shrinking circle is a deadly ring of fire capable of killing meandering squads instantly. Of course, we'll know a lot more when Redsec officially drops tomorrow. Here's exactly when that's happening. Battlefield RedSec release date and time for each region After weeks of rumors about an impending shadow drop, EA decided to give everyone a day's notice. Battlefield Redsec is out October 28 , but the exact timing depends on your region.

One Steam reviewer calls Dementium \"a bit like Silent Hill crossed with Doom 3,\" before zeroing in on an even more specific comparison: \" Afraid of Monsters crossed with Doom 3, for those of you who have dabbled in Half-life horror mods.\" Dementium may not be an all-timer horror game, but it was a bit clever, a bit different, and seeing it pop up on Steam got me thinking about just how many games developed for the Nintendo DS fit that description. And equally, how few are playable anywhere but the DS, even 15 years after Nintendo stopped making new handhelds. Steam has seen HD remasters of some of the DS's best games over the years: Zero Escape Etrian Odyssey 1,2, and 3 Ace Attorney Trilogy Castlevania Dominus Collection Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective But it's a weirdly short list given just how many bangers came out on the DS over the course of its life.
