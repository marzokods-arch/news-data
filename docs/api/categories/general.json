Launched Monday (Nov. 3), the collection, backed by Selena Gomez and Shay Mitchell of Pretty Little Liars fame, included three makeup accessories — a cosmetic pouch, blush case and a makeup brush pouch — all in a special peachy shade called &#8220;Worth,&#8221; inspired by Rare Beauty&#8217;s Soft Pinch Liquid Blush of the same name. While the cosmetic pouch and blush case have sold out, you can still get your hands on the limited-edition makeup brush pouch for $24 on Beis&#8217; website . The makeup brush pouch comes with a zip-up construction, perfect for keeping all of your Rare Beauty brushes neat and organized. Elastic loops nestled inside the case cradles each brush.

Movies, TV shows, and 21 channels disappeared from YouTube TV as a result, but Disney content is also vanishing from more Google platforms. Users can no longer buy or rent Disney content from YouTube, Google Play, or Google TV as the negotiations continue. Google and Disney are amid a tense content rights battle that saw 21 channels disappear from YouTube TV last week. Disney is using its strong content portfolio, which includes ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic, as leverage in the negotiations. Now, it appears Disney is pulling its owned media from all of Google’s digital storefronts, not just YouTube TV’s live television service. Movies and TV shows owned by Disney or its subsidiaries are no longer available for purchase or to rent on Google Play, YouTube, or Google TV , as spotted by 9to5Google . Users will only be able to watch Disney-owned content on those platforms if they previously purchased them or have an active Disney Plus subscription.",

It also features liquid cooling, large vapor chambers, and a built-in waterproof fan. Starting at $749, global sales will begin on November 19, with early-bird vouchers and discounts available beforehand. When it comes to gaming phones , REDMAGIC has been releasing a steady stream of powerful devices that punch well above their price point, and the latest is now here to take things to the next level. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 phones to hit the market, but it has a few extra features that no phone can match. Starting with the SoC, the 8 Elite Gen 5 is the latest and greatest on the market, with our early testing indicating a 20% bump in CPU and GPU performance in reference devices for testing. We are still actively benchmarking the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, and those gains appear to hold true in this device as well. Stay tuned for our full test results and benchmarks later this week.",

This Tuesday, T-Mobile will give away free beanies as part of its weekly subscriber rewards system. As The Mobile Report notes, this is a classic beanie in T-Mobile’s signature magenta color, featuring a black band and the carrier’s tiny logo.

This feature is currently available in the US only, and can be accessed by tapping on the Ask tab in the Photos app. Google Photos v7.52.0 includes code for a new way to access Ask Photos, and we’ve managed to activate it before its launch to give you an early look.

Google recently announced an assembly line in India , and around mid-2025, it finally launched its own online Google Store here, complete with first-party accessories and trade-in options. Naturally, I headed straight there to pre-book a Pixel 10 , trading in my old Pixel 6a that I had lying around.

Google still has a long way to go to get its premier in-car phone mirroring product to that pinnacle. To be fair to Google, recent updates have addressed some of its user base’s biggest annoyances.

In 2022, Google merged its then-popular video calling app Duo into Meet , which, at the time, was limited to video calling for Workspace accounts. Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

    "body": "Recently, I reported that AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon had all released their Q3 2025 financial results. Verizon’s rivals are doing well, but Big Red finds itself in a much less rosy position. While it did manage to add more than 40,000 new subscribers this quarter, those gains came entirely from its prepaid and business divisions. Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Protecting our expensive new smartphone is a top priority for many of us, and online marketplaces are flooded with options, from cases to display protection . An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Google has been working to bring its latest Material 3 Expressive aesthetics across multiple apps and interfaces.

The Pixel Watch 4 is splattered with a healthy dose of the Expressive design, thanks to its Wear OS 6 interface . Meanwhile, Google has also been testing a design revamp for apps such as Maps , even on older versions of Wear OS. Apps, such as Google Calendar , Home, Keep, Messages , and Gemini for Watch , already have the updated visuals. Now, YouTube Music on Wear OS is getting a similar treatment.",

Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S .

Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.
