I found a hefty deposit early on, and I've smelted it all down into iron ingots for making fancy weaponry and armor. If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

I've played more than my fair share of cozy life sims, managing everything from farms to convenience stores, but a caravan was a new one that I'd been itching to try. Cozy Caravan launched into early access on Steam last year and just rolled out its 1.0 update this month. It's not the deepest life sim by a long shot, but it's cute and approachable. The rest of my thoughts are down below, but here's a quick pros and 'less pros' chart: ✅ My favorite parts ⚠️ Take note though Adorable animations and chillstep-y tunes Recommends playing with controller Lots of little cooking minigames Stop motion animation can be disabled if it makes you sick Real time market day selling No money management Cute collectathon fetch quests NPC dialogue can be very repetitive (Image credit: 5 Lives Studio) There are four main activities that occupy my time in Cozy Caravan: driving between poi…",

To hold folks over until Season 2's new launch date of February 17, Battlefield 6 will get another mini battle pass free of charge. It's called the Frostfire Bonus Path and includes a weapon package, at least one soldier skin, and a bunch of double XP tokens (the simplest way to pad out a battle pass you didn't plan on having to make). I'm all for devs taking extra time to finish updates instead of slavishly adhering to an arbitrary three-month cycle, especially because Season 1 wasn't exactly great. We got one good map that probably should've been there at launch , one OK map, and a bunch of guns as forgettable and samey as Call of Duty's wall of grey metal.

Below, I'll go over how to invite friends to your Hytale world.

DLSS 4.5 can draw a ton more power from your graphics card. Nick has been going to town testing DLSS 4.5 since the Nvidia App beta released, running presets across different games and across both an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti , just to see how hefty the performance difference is between the GPU generations. While editing his article I've been scrubbing through the video benchmarks on the page, and while you're not always seeing a huge performance difference in terms of frame rates, you're often seeing a big delta between the power draw of the two DLSS models.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG. These do things slightly differently at the sub-pixel level—QD-OLEDs have square red, green,…",

At CES 2026, Gigabyte introduced its Clocked Unbuffered Dual In-Line Memory Module (or CQDIMM), allowing for high-capacity memory PCs to run without the otherwise common compromises to stability and frequency. The tech was shown off, alongside BIOS tuning software, in a set-up built upon the CQDIMM Edition of the Z890 Aorus Tachyon ICE motherboard. Inside were two beefy sticks of 128 GB RAM, for a total 256 GB of DDR5-7200 memory—twice as much as the standard version. \"On the hardware side, Gigabyte has optimized motherboard circuit layouts to significantly reduce memory channel loading, improving signal integrity and ensuring stable operation even under heavy workloads,\" the company explains. \"Complementing the hardware advancements is Gigabyte’s sophisticated BIOS tuning technology. Through an optimized clock driver architecture, Gigabyte’s BIOS intelligently manages timing, signal synchronization, and voltage behavior to unleash extreme performance.\" Gigabyte has a track record of pushing DDR5 memory to its limits but, generally speaking, that muc…",

Goodman Games has been making some of the best ever for years now, as part of its Dungeon Crawl Classics series. They're unapologetically old school—weird, scary, and absolutely bursting with creativity. So I'm excited to see that Humble Bundle is offering a huge bundle of DCC books , including some of the coolest adventures it's released over the last decade and change. (Image credit: Goodman Games) These are all written for the Dungeon Crawl Classics system—Goodman Games' gonzo take on the original D&D rules—but are easily adapted to any system built for retro dungeon crawling, such as Old School Essentials, Mörk Borg, Shadowdark, or Knave. The 98 item tier is the standout here, offering all the adventures in PDF form, plus the DCC core rulebook, supplements, and assets for virtual tabletop play, for $18 / £13.43. I know we're probably all a bit jaded to massive bundles at this point, but that really is a wild amount of stuff for the money.

But that's okay, because as it so happens, they're both actually pretty good. Well, in the case of the new DLSS 4.5, it's mostly good. With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas.

Instead, it's because initial batches of the platinum white cables look ever so slightly \"purple\" . Lian Li wrote, \"After further review, we agree that the current white cables do carry a noticeable purple hue, which may not be visually ideal for certain PC build aesthetics. For users who prefer a cleaner and more unified look, we’re happy to provide a replacement set of pure white cables to replace the existing ones and better complement their PC builds.\" Placed side-by-side, the difference is subtle but undeniable.

I am writing this post to inform you, PC gamers who may not have played ingenious puzzle game Blue Prince, about a great deal. It is in no way merely a cover for me to revisit the topic of PC Gamer's official 2025 GOTY vote which I am definitely not still salty about here in 2026. * According to this very website , Blue Prince is the Best Designed game of 2025. True! But that award reflects that it was the runner-up to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which narrowly beat it for the top game of the year prize. To that result, I say: \"Rigged!!\" Okay, not rigged. But I believe I'll be vindicated by history in declaring this miraculous detective game, designed largely by a single mind over the course of eight years , as the game of 2025. I fought hard for Blue Prince to get PC Gamer's top GOTY honor, because I really don't think there's anything else like it out there. It contains so many layers of mystery and discovery—puzzles you didn't even know were puzzles for 10 or 20 hours, clues that may only make sense …",

    "body": "CD Projekt wrapped up 2025 by selling off GOG , its famously DRM-free digital storefront, to Michal Kiciński , a co-founder of both CD Projekt and GOG. In the years since it launched, GOG has expanded beyond 'good old games' to carry a selection of newer releases, but it remains relatively niche, and has never been a big moneymaker for CD Projekt. But in a new interview with GamesIndustry , Kiciński and GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski said there's room for it to flourish and find success, even in a marketplace so utterly dominated by Steam. The core of the strategy seems simple enough: Throwing hands with Steam is a bad idea, so don't do it. \"Steam is obviously a Goliath,\" said Gołębiewski. \"So for any company to try to tackle Steam is a very hard battle. We've seen Discord launch their store, we've seen Epic Games launch their store—and thanks to the lawsuit with Apple, we know how much it has cost them to launch this battle against Steam. \"So the fact that GOG is expanding, developing, and still kicking, I think it's a testament to the fact that GOG really has its space on the market with its mission of making games live forever.\" Gołębiewski said Steam is \"doing an awe…",

What follows is a picture of just a handful of PCs sat on a few shelves. \"Um, as a favor, if you buy a new one, please sell your gaming PC to our company...We buy them back at pretty high prices...Whether it's a gaming desk or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC…\" A few days after this original post, Sofmap said , \"If anyone is considering selling their gaming PC, please feel free to send a DM to this account. We're working on setting up a system for preliminary estimates in a simple manner...!\" That system implies a lot of interest in selling off old wares, and I know if Sofmap were close to me, I'd certainly have a couple of old parts to drop off. Still, Sofmap must only be buying for 'pretty high prices' because it's getting them in return, and that's certainly a bit of an oddity. ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これあの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください...結構高く買い…",

And yes, you read that right, they've done all this before the official Hytale launch time has even rolled around, since the developers let modders get cooking early. Nevertheless, that means we've got Doom running in Hytale before the general playerbase has had hands on Hytale itself.
