Blake had a late-in-life resurgence in popularity thanks to the 1978-79 Broadway musical&nbsp; Eubie! , which showcased his ebullient songs, such as “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Shuffle Along.” Cher, by contrast, has just always been there, never far removed from a hit record, TV show, movie or tour in the more than 60 years she has been a star.

However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen.

Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while. The experimenting continues, and some viewers are about to see another switch-up. This time, YouTube is testing a new take on the Dislike button that affects both its placement and exact meaning. In a post on the Google Support forums , YouTube says it’s experimenting with folding “Dislike” and “Not interested” into a single thumbs-down option for Shorts. Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu. Depending on the test group, it may appear as “Dislike” or “Not interested,” but the action itself remains the same.",

Compared to existing foldables, it may be wider than Google’s Pixel Fold, but not as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to announce the device by late 2026, though shipments might not stabilize until mid-to-late 2027 due to production ramp-up issues. The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year. While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience.

Users can now select their external display within the “Cast your screen” dialog to stream its contents to other devices. As part of its efforts to bring Android to PCs with ‘ Aluminium OS ,’ Google has been steadily improving how the operating system handles input peripherals, app windowing, and external displays. This includes both big changes that the majority of users expect from desktop OSes as well as smaller tweaks that only a fraction of users will appreciate. With the release of Android 16 in June, for example, Google updated the screen recorder dialog to allow you to select external displays, enabling you to record activity on them.

The 2024 OnePlus 12R stood out as the best $500 smartphone of last year, while the OnePlus 13R delivered an improved experience across the board, justifying its higher $600 price tag. The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

Homey Self-Hosted Server supports Matter, LAN, and cloud devices by default, with Zigbee and Z-Wave available via an optional Homey Bridge. The software is available worldwide with a free trial, followed by a monthly subscription or a one-time lifetime license. Homey seems to have recognized that there’s a significant overlap between people who like to build out a comprehensive smart home and those who also prefer running their own bespoke setups. With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control. Until now, Homey’s lineup has centered on a combination of cloud-based control and physical hubs, such as Homey Pro. With the Homey Self-Hosted Server, the company is opening up its pla…",

This change prevents gallery clutter by removing the redundant initial screenshot once the full scrolling capture is saved or shared. We spotted this quality-of-life improvement in the latest Android Canary build, and it could arrive in the Android 16 QPR3 stable release next March. When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows. Scrolling screenshots are a relatively new addition to Android, introduced back in Android 12 . Since then, Google has barely touched the feature, but it’s finally preparing a small but welcome quality-of-life improvement. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

We’ve seen a major spike in RAM prices in recent weeks, and it’s expected that these price hikes could result in Android phones with less RAM than before.

AYN has announced on IndieGogo and Discord that shipments of the Odin 3 Ultra model, which features 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, have been delayed to mid-January 2026.
