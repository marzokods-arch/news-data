You're not physically held hostage, but the belief that you're trapped becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. That's the crux of Luto, a first-person psychological horror game aesthetically similar to P.T. and narrated by The Stanley Parable's distant cousin. It's confusing, terrifying, cheeky, and touching all at once.

Occasionally a different mode is introduced with a new map, but those rarely receive much support—League has been focused on refining a single map and mode of play for nearly two decades now. Dota gets a little sillier —okay, a lot sillier —and Heroes of the Storm prioritizes breadth over depth with all sorts of smaller maps, but the average MOBA feels familiar each time you return. Three lanes, kill creeps for gold, buy a consistent number of powerful items, try not to pass out from sheer anger when it all goes wrong. Valve's Deadlock , on the other hand, has spent the last year rocking the boat frequently with no warning or restraint. Where other MOBAs are happy to get a new hero a few times a year with the very occasional dual release , Deadlock shows off six in one go and lets players tear each other apart over, er, voting for, which gets added first.

It's pretty great.\" It's not entirely a surprise: Slavov posted on X that \"we are back\" when Divinity was revealed at The Game Awards in December 2025. Still, it's nice to have official word from the top, and the interest in Slavov's return runs deep enough that the question was asked twice. Larian publishing director Michael Douse fielded the second one, writing, \"Bobby never left. He's cooking.\" (They call him Bobby, you see.) Slavov began working with Larian on Divinity: Original Sin 2 after the unexpected death of Kirill Pokrovsky , the composer on every Divinity game through Original Sin, in 2015.

After years of asking for it, Diablo 4 players are finally getting leaderboards—and a new mode to go with them—in its next update. Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta.

Our Jeremy has already been keeping an eye on surging PC hardware prices , but this morning presented a more recent example. I just wrote a deal post about the 1 TB version of the Lexar NM790 NVMe SSD which, today, is going for $118. Not terrible, right? Well, that's what I thought until I remembered I had in fact written about the same SSD back in October of last year—when it was only $66. That is a close to 50% price increase in about four months. Even worse, this same drive cost almost $150 within the last month according to Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel . The Lexar is far from the most egregious increase I've seen, with higher capacity SSDs more severely affected. For one extreme example, Best Buy is currently asking for over a grand for the 4 TB version of the WD_Black SN850X SSD.

It's something much more mundane: multi-day laptop battery life. AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, recently took a swing at Panther Lake , and part of the argumentation is that consumers buy chips based on needs, rather than going for a little bit of everything. In this, Tikoo argues that AMD offers the top of the line for gaming, and therefore, gamers will pick AMD. However, as someone who games a lot, I don't actually look for the absolute best gaming performance out of my laptop. I look for 'good enough' gaming, plus solid ergonomics, a decent weight, and most importantly, strong battery life.

Sure, it's the studio's \"biggest game ever\" , shifting back to Larian's own world after the success of Baldur's Gate 3 , but we're left with little more than an atmosphere after its bloody reveal trailer at The Game Awards . That said, I don't really care that much because Larian has confirmed the only news that matters. When asked about the way defences would work in Divinity, head of design Nick Pechenin explained that it would \"not keep the magic armor system from DOS2\", and that's music to my ears. Comment from r/Games For the uninitiated, Divinity: Original Sin 2 split protection into two categories: physical and magical. The problem is that these were effectively two different additional health bars for enemies, weakened by two entirely separate types of damage, and you'd need to break at least one. What this meant is that you were generally much better off having your party focus on either physical or magical damage to break your chosen type faster, rather than using a mixed party and splitting damage between the two types. Plus, you were often be…",

As helpfully laid out in Yukidama's YouTube video , an EMR tablet is one that uses Electromagnetic Resonance that sends a signal to a tablet, which is then translated by the tablet. It's a quick and responsive bit of technology, but different pen vendors work off different frequencies, which can impact compatibility. The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies.

    "body": "Well, here's a product I didn't have on my CES bingo card. Asus has partnered with boutique headphone manufacturer Hifiman to bring planar magnetic drivers to its new gaming headset, the Asus ROG Kithara . For those not in the know, planar magnetic drivers use a magnet-suspended diaphragm to deliver exceptionally crisp and accurate audio, which makes them highly-prized among audiophiles. Our best audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , uses a similar pair—but it looks like there's some new competition in town. I got a chance to hear the ROG Kithara for myself at the Asus booth at CES 2026, and it certainly sounds supercharged. One of the downsides of planar magnetics is that they can struggle with low-end punch, but Asus has tweaked the Hifiman 100 mm versions to high heaven, and it shows. Watching a clip of Counter-Strike 2 gameplay, the impact sounds were pretty jawbone-rumbling. The open-backed wired set was plugged in to a substantial DAC/amplifier combo, so they were obviously being pushed quite heavily, but boy did it make for some serious air movement. The soundstage seemed plenty wide, too, which should make for some great atmospheric audio. Asus says the frequenc…",

    "body": "Phasmophobia was an instant classic when it launched back in 2020, and it continues to be one of the top games on Steam to this day, having surpassed over 25 million copies sold in early access. It even spawned a wave of similarly successful hits like REPO and Lethal Company , playing its part in birthing the questionably-named friendslop genre (it's a co-op horror game, really). It's safe to say that this success came as a surprise to the at-the-time solo developer Daniel Knight. Now a team of over 30 developers known as Kinetic Games, the studio has revealed the launch of its new publishing label, aptly named Kinetic Publishing. Having learned a great deal about indie game development over the last five years, Knight, now the CEO of Kinetic, believes it's time to put that experience to use to help other independent developers. \"The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey\", says Knight .
