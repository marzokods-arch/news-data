Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses. If you want to add it to your collection (and you should), here's what you need to do. How to get the Kaoson in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm the Kaoson from Primordial Guardian Origo, the final boss of the Terminus Range vault . To access the Arch of Origo vault, you need to find all three vault key fragments in Terminus Range. Once inside, fight through three waves of enemies until you reach Origo. Like all bosses, you can use the nearby Moxxi's Big Encore machine to repeatedly farm Origo in hopes of getting a lucky Kaoson drop. Primordi…",

Early tests are all rather positive, despite that quirk. According to YouTuber The Phawx , the device feels \"comically light\" without the external battery, and he likes it a lot with the battery slapped on the back. He says, \"I just ultimately prefer the battery pack on at all times.\" Effectively, with the Win 5, you can either keep it plugged in all the time, or connect a battery to the back of the device via a port and locking mechanism. Think of how the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons work, with a clip letting them slide up and out. It is not, however, hot swappable, so plugging out the battery entirely shuts it down. The Phawx points out that the battery strapped onto the back covers some of the device's intake fans, though he hasn't had the chance to fully test the thermals yet. He did, however, notice the fans felt a little louder with the pack on. In exchange for this strange battery system, you get the full-fat Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip, complete with 40 RDNA …",

So when director Yoko Taro says he wanted to create something that even he couldn't quite grasp, I kinda see where he's coming from. Speaking to Archipel in a new video about his writing process, in which Taro wears his trademark \"Emil\" mask (a character from Nier), the creator says he had no idea where to start with Automata, other than knowing he wanted a new \"starting point each time\" and \"something different to write\" for projects. \"Drakengard depicts a dark and violent story, whereas Nier Replicant is themed around sorrow,\" says Taro. \"At the time, there wasn't really something set in stone that I wanted to do.

As spotted by Hackaday , the half-hour-long video of the YouTuber making a 'portable' Xbox Original is sort of like the lovechild of a mad scientist, a teacher, and a stream of consciousness. After grabbing an Xbox that isn't working, James figures out that the DVD drive is flagging a hard drive issue, and fixes the DVD drive by replacing a tiny failing resistor with four separate, much bigger resistors, then hot-glueing them down. This is subsequently followed by smacking the top of the Xbox until the disk tray comes out. Then, after fixing the original Xbox, James takes it apart again and starts throwing the bits of plastic he doesn't need on the floor. Taking apart this plastic is important to get the central motherboard and necessary components as small as possible, and he replaces the big unwieldy hard drive with a CompactFlash drive, saving a little more space. …",

In a recent, brief chat with YouTuber HarrisonShippp , Ogg was asked how excited he was for GTA 6's release next year. \"I feel nothing inside,\" answered Ogg, definitively. And just in case you're wondering if that's a more general cry for help, he quickly made clear he was speaking specifically about GTA: \"I'm not a gamer. I've never played a videogame, so I feel absolutely nothing.\" Which, hey, fair enough. Some voice actors get super deep into their roles—like the cast of Baldur's Gate 3—and for others it's just a paycheque. Neither's an illegitimate approach, and Ogg has made clear before that he's not keen on GTA fans essentially treating him like Trevor in real life. But then it gets a little weirder. \"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'\" recounted Ogg. \"I said, 'Why?' They said 'Because it's so great!' And I said,…",

It's much more complicated than people think.\" DICE producer Jeremy Chubb noted that while players have \"really particular views\" about the original Operation Firestorm and how it should be remade, they may be disappointed if the developers don't \"evolve it and embrace the new ideas and features\" in Battlefield 6.

A good, deep D&D adventure as I imagined them to be—basically Mazes and Monsters , minus the moral panic psychosis—was out of reach. The first Baldur's Gate changed all that, with great dungeons, an epic quest, and most important of all, a deep cast of characters with their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities—and who, just like in the real world, would sometimes gel or clash with their fellows in unexpected ways. Some became fast friends, others would try to literally murder each other, and a handful would just throw their hands up in disgust at my obvious incompetence and leave, after giving me a good telling-off of course.

The Internet Archive team hasn’t said much, either, only offering a short update on its blog stating, “The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.” It’s the end to a case that was originally filed back in 2023 and marks yet another clash between copyright protection and content preservation. The “Great 78 Project” at the heart of the case aimed to digitize and preserve 78 rpm shellac records , or “78s”, which were made roughly from 1898 through the 1950s.

Just two years later, Baldur's Gate 2 expanded on it so much that development nearly ballooned out of control. This is the story of one of the most influential and ambitious RPGs ever made. Many of the great RPGs are etched into the popular imagination by their beginnings, those tentative first steps in a new fantasy world that tease the vastness ahead, and the freedom to carve your own path through it. The first steps into Baldur's Gate 2's world are one of those moments. After a tough opening sequence that sees you escaping captivity from the wizard Irenicus, you emerge into Waukeen's Promenade, the trading hub of Amn's central city of Athkatla. Surrounded by golden minarets, it's a bustling amphitheater of traders and thieves, wealthy and poor – a filthy and vibrant snapshot of urban plenitude.
