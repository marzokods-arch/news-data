The division of Universal Music Group (UMG) focused on Latin artists and culture — whose high-profile artists include J Balvin , Karol G , Xavi and Ivan Cornejo — has slowly but surely become a front-runner since Seroussi launched it six years ago, ending 2024 as Billboard ’s No. 3 top Latin label and continuing the trek in 2025 on multiple fronts. “From the continued success of global stars like Karol G and J Balvin, to helping drive the next wave of música mexicana with the genre’s new leaders like Ivan Cornejo, Xavi and Gabito Ballesteros , to seeing tremendous growth in international markets like Spain, where artists like Bad Gyal and Judeline are really making an impact — it’s been a standout year,” Seroussi says …",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A software bug involving Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) causes jittery video recording on the Pixel 10 series’ telephoto camera. The issue persists across multiple apps, including third-party ones that utilize Google’s EIS API. Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.

If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors.

Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority TL;DR BOOX will launch its new smartphone-like e-reader with cellular connectivity tomorrow. It’s unclear if the device, called the P6 Pro, will support cellular calls. However, the BOOX has confirmed it will support VoIP calls. The device will be available in color and black-and-white E-Ink display options. BOOX is finally ready to reveal its exciting, new smartphone-sized e-reader . The company has announced that the device, called the BOOX P6 Pro, will officially launch in China on October 9. Following its quiet but impressive debut at IFA 2025, where we got an early hands-on look at a pre-release unit, the upcoming P6 Pro looks like the biggest leap yet for BOOX’s Palma lineup.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR NotebookLM has a new feature in Discover Sources that allows you to search for information inside your Google Drive files. This integration enables you to locate information within documents and presentations, and allows you to add the parent file as a source. The update appears to have been rolled out quietly, as there’s no official announcement from Google. NotebookLM is one of the best and most practical applications of AI for average users like you and me . Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR Some Android gamers are running the Xenia emulator inside GameHub or Winlator to play Xbox 360 games on their phones. Many tested games have very poor performance, although a few titles do seem to run at a playable frame rate. The good news is that an Xbox 360 emulator is in the works for Android. There’s no shortage of quality emulators on Android today, allowing you to run everything from NES and PlayStation 3 games to PC titles. But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",
