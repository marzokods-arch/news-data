    "body": "Nvidia utterly dominates the market for GPUs, be that AI chips or gaming graphics cards. But this, apparently, is not enough. Now, Nvidia is gunning for the CPU market, too. Nvidia previously announced a new Arm processor called Vera and based on custom-designed CPU cores. Now the company has announced an initial customer for the chip and emphasised that it is the first time it has supplied a CPU as a separate product. Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton. But not all that much is known about Nvidia's Vera CPU. Nvidia has previously said that it runs a new custom-designed Arm core called Olympus. Beyond that, data points are limited to the fact that Vera has 88 cores, is rated at 50 W and offers double the p…",

Apparently, doing it for the second Expedition and the Snap and Salvage quest wasn't enough; once again, you'll have to hop into Stella Montis and hope that you spawn close enough to grab the materials you need before they've been looted by everyone else. This time you'll need a Rotary Encoder and an Ion Sputter , and will also have to complete some additional steps in Stella Montis itself. With further adieu, here's how to complete With a View, plus both items you need. Where to find a Rotary Encoder in Arc Raiders You can find a Rotary Encoder in Medical or Assembly—I found mine in a drawer in the former (Image credit: Embark Studios) Since the Rotary Encoder is an Exodus material, you can find it in Assembly, Medical, or in the security office in the Lobby in Stella Montis. I personally found mine in a drawer on the upper floor of the Medical area. As with finding any exodus material in Stella Montis, the key is spawning close to the areas and then effectively rushing them before all the containers have been looted—it's not ideal, but this will keep happening so long as qu…",

In 2022, the lawsuit says, Bank of America issued a report concluding that Hasbro was \"overproducing Magic cards, which have propped up Hasbro’s recent results but are destroying the long-term value of the brand.\" Despite questioning from shareholders and analysts, however, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants \"repeatedly denied such speculation,\" issuing \"materially false and misleading\" statements during shareholder calls where those concerns were raised.

Official Highguard promotion stopped as soon as it started, which prompted a swell of spectators (largely on X, the misery app) to declare Highguard the next Concord and question if it would be delayed or cancelled outright. Speaking with Wildlight at a hands-on event in Los Angeles last week, several Highguard devs admitted they wished the reveal had gone down differently, but made it clear that the mixed reception didn't alter their release plans. \"Look, I wish Highguard had been received better.

But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled.

To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good.

I've hauled many discrete GPU-equipped lappys into the office for a spot of real-world testing, and most of them are usually begging to be plugged into a wall socket by lunchtime. Upon hearing Intel's battery life efficiency claims for its new, Panther Lake-based, Core Ultra Series 3 chips, I knew what needed to be done. Top up my Asus Zenbook Duo review sample overnight, take it on my round trip from my Southampton home to PC Gamer Towers in Bath (a roughly 126 mile jaunt), use it for a regular day, and record when it conks out. It's a dGPU-less machine, which means all the graphics hardware is contained onboard the single Core Ultra X9 388H chip at its heart. Despite this, the built-in Arc B390 iGPU delivers some impressive gaming performance for its size, meaning that laptops powered by Intel's new mobile chips (the ones with chonky iGPUs, anyway) can now reasonably be called gaming laptops. Intel says that Core Ultra Series 3 machines can boast up to 27-hour battery life , but my Asus sample is a bit different. It'…",

But no, all we got was a single Ryzen 7 9850X3D announcement and no mention whatsoever of the vaunted dual-CCD 3D V-Cache chip. But a new EEC listing from AMD before the weekend has listed a new Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 processor alongside the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and a bunch of Threadripper chips. (Image credit: EEC) To bring you up to speed, 3D V-Cache is AMD's bespoke technology which underlays an extra chunk of L3 cache underneath the processor cores in a Zen 5 CPU package. The benefit of this is that games in particular benefit from all that extra on-die memory, reducing the number of times programs have to dip into slower system memory and therefore boosting frame rates. On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache. But for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips, which have multiple core complex dies (CCD) to accommodate their higher core counts, only one CCD gets the extra cache. With the…",

Thanks to Sydney-based web developer Arin Sarkisian, Doom now runs on a pair of earbuds. More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM. And while the earbuds can only hold 4 MB of data (Doom is just a bit larger than that), the 1.7 MB Squashware WAD is small enough to fit. The powe…",

If you've played Risk of Rain 2, you'll know that it can be pretty tough, especially if you're heading into its alien wildernesses on your own. Such is the case with Lort. However, it seems some players are unhappy with the game's balancing, and their complaints are primarily why 28% of reviews are negative on Steam . On Friday, Big Distraction released an update to Lort making some adjustments to its challenge. But they also don't seem entirely happy about it. In a Steam post accompanying the update, Big Distraction addressed the issue of Lort's challenge. While it doesn't quite amount to \"git gud\", Big Distraction said that players shouldn't come to Lort expecting an easy ride. \"Lort is a roguelike and isn't meant to be a super easy game,\" the post reads. \"You are meant to die and learn how to overcome the challenge of each new level, enemy and boss.

When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak.
