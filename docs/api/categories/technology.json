In a round of Spooky Express, your job is to lay out train tracks so that you pick up and drop off passengers where they're trying to go. Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before. It runs great on Steam Deck, by the way. Very pleasing. It's also on Remote Play Together on Steam, so you can collaboratively solve with others remot…",

In November the North Line update will bring the first beefy patch that'll make more substantial changes to the state of play. North Line's biggest addition will be the Stella Montis map, adding a new region of the Rust Belt that's currently, tantalizingly locked on the in-game world map.

While the patent application in question, JP 2024-031879 , isn't directly relevant to the Palworld lawsuit, it's related to patents that are: It's the child application of one of the patents asserted in Nintendo's accusations and is itself the parent application of another. The rejection, therefore, could give Pocketpair a rhetorical opportunity to encourage a similar investigation of the patents it's accused of infringing.

Well, luckily, Corsair has announced a new professional-looking fighter stick, and I can't wait to lose at my local tournament with it. The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board. Keys can be set from anywhere to 0.1mm to 4mm, which means you can make surrounding keys a little harder to press and important ones easier to hit. Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often. Being wireless, it can be connected via Bluetooth, or connected to your rig in 2.4 GHz mode, offering lower latency th…",

Over the years, I've seen the scepticism from comments on my articles and reviews, various online discussion boards, and even friends and colleagues.

I know a lot of gamers will read this and think duh , but this isn't for them; it's for those who are still clinging on to the familiar, like I was for so long. And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless.

The idea seemed to spring out of discussions around the capabilities of the upcoming Tesla AI5 chip, which is said to be up to 40x faster than the current Tesla AI4 chip fitted to many of its cars (via Tom's Hardware ). Musk openly wondered if the upcoming chip \"might almost be too much intelligence for a car\", which led to his pitching of a concept he seems to have been rolling around for a while: \"One of the things I thought,\" said Musk, \"If we've got all of these cars that maybe are bored... we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet... if they're not actively driving\" \"At some point, if you've got 100 million cars in the fleet... and let's say they had, at the point, a kilowatt of inference capability... that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with cooling and power conversion taken care of.

Not a sentence I expected to write about an extraction shooter, I'll be honest. But what Scrappy wants, Scrappy gets, and in this case, it's six prickly pears. Your chicken overlord also demands olives, which you can find the same way as lemons and apricots above, and a cat bed . Below, I'll run through where to find prickly pears, as well as your best bet for harvesting enough of the fruit to appease Scrappy. Arc Raiders prickly pear location Prickly pears come from cacti, such as the patch in the south of the Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) You can find prickly pears by cacti plants that you see dotted around in Arc Raiders' various regions, but the best location I've found for cacti is in the south of the Buried City , where there's a cactus patch, marked in the screenshot above. Annoyingly, prickly pears seem to randomly spawn around cacti, meaning that, sometimes, you might not even find one. You'll want to make sure you bring a loadout with a safety pocket as opposed…",

I have had plenty of close calls with this Leaper as it really manages to pick its moments to rain hellfire down upon my friends and I. Just last night I was trying to reason with another squad as to why we should stop fighting and all just get into the lift to Speranza, only for the Leaper to jump into the middle of these peace negotiations and mess it all up. So, I'm well aware of how much of a pain these big Arcs can be, but I don't want that to change. (Image credit: Embark Studios) There's been a few rumblings among some Arc Raiders players that the bigger Arcs need to get nerfed: \"The rocketeers killed millions of players over 2 days in the server slam. They are too strong.\" With others noticing how a lot of streamers have been calling for this as the bots are just too hard to fight and take down. But I think they're all missing the point.

I know what's really important, and it's that fashion is back, baby! Let's GO! Okay, now that I've caught my breath, here's the breaking news: In FF14, you can set glamour plates, similar to World of Warcraft's transmog system. This lets you overlay a preset outfit onto your character's gear, and like all MMOs, it's the true endgame. Let's be real, we're just here to play dress-up. We know what we are. There is one caveat, though—you can't glamour items meant for other classes or jobs onto your gear. So a set made for a Fisher can't be used on, say, Lancer equipment. That is, until mid-December of this year. As announced during the live letter, Patch 7.4 will allow players to glamour any piece of equipment, regardless of level of class restrictions, onto any other piece of equipment. No hooks, no catch—well, you can't do weapons, but that makes total sense given the animation nightmare of trying to turn a White Mage staff into a greatsword. It's otherwise a complete free-for-all.
