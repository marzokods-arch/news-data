You can slide halfway across the globe and follow it up with a shotgun blast before rolling back at the speed of light. These are examples of useful, nigh on game-breaking movement tricks that I'm not sure were ever intended, but I kind of hope they stick around given how cool they are. On the opposite side of the spectrum is this, a wall…shimmy? Basically, by grabbing a ledge, pressing forward and either left or right sideways movement, and holding the jump button, you're able to jump along the ledge. You'll drain stamina, so it's not quite infinite as the YouTuber above, Jiibii, says. But it's not all that intensive. It's a neat trick and something I had no clue you could do, and most importantly, something I'd never have figured out myself because, well, I'm not quite sure where it's actually practical.

This news comes somewhat cryptically from one of the most reliable leakers in the business, kopite7kimi (via WCCFTech ). It's a slightly convoluted data trail. But to cut a long story short, kopite7kimi responded to a story discussing 144 MB verticle cache allocations, which is expected to be known as bLLC or big last level cache in Intel parlance. For certain versions of Intel's upcoming Nova Lake CPUs, kopite7kimi clarified that there will be models with two compute tiles and thus double the stacked cache. So, according to this information, the top Intel Nova Lake CPU will have two compute tiles, each with eight Performance and 16 Efficient cores, plus 144 MB of vertical cache or bLLC. That makes for a total of 48 cores and 288 MB of Intel's equivalent to AMD V-Cache. The chips will also have another four low-power Efficient cores located in the SoC tile, making for a…",

When played on (or even near) those laptops, the song would cause the drives to malfunction—and it was such a widespread problem that Microsoft incorporated code into Windows XP to filter out that particular frequency. Sounds unbelievable, but it's true! Audio experts, laptop makers and Windows developers all worked together to confirm the story—so when I was re-reading the 2022 Microsoft blog that first made the story news, I suddenly found myself wondering what other damage precisely the right (or, I suppose, wrong) sound frequency could do. For example: Could you cause a chicken's head to explode with just the power of sound? A comment on the 2022 blog casually suggests that perhaps such a thing is possible. \"There is also the story of the resonant frequency of chicken skulls from the old Borland Turbo C++ documentation,\" it says.

That's a tremendous deal on one of the best (and only) big budget singleplayer shooters in recent years, especially considering it's barely six months old. Is it the best Doom of the modern trilogy?

We're keeping track of the latest changes to RAM prices here. The cause is mostly the newly booming AI industry, as AI servers require a lot of memory, both in terms of long-term storage and short-term system memory.

It was a means to an end, so to speak, that end being room for more junk, of course. That's not to say I couldn't feel the difference between a naked gun and a decked-out one; I just didn't put much thought into it. Needless to say, it wasn't optimal, in part because I'd entirely underestimated attachments in favour of trying to accumulate a stockpile of the best guns . After watching ModernNik's impressively comprehensive attachment breakdown, I won't be making those same mistakes again. They tested every type of attachment, and even though some of the gains may look small—like a 0.16ms recoil recovery boost from a common stock—it all adds up. By far my biggest takeaway is that the 'quality sweet-spot', for lack of a better term, is often green, uncommon attachments. These offer the most bang for your buck, as blue, rare attachments often come with pesky drawbacks that tend to outweigh the positives, though there are a few excep…",

    "body": "Long defunct game developer Troika is best known today for the dark roleplaying masterpiece/dropped bag of spanners Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. But the year before Bloodlines simultaneously spelled doom and immortality for the studio, Troika released The Temple of Elemental Evil , a similarly ambitious and similarly buggy adaptation of the Dungeon & Dragons scenario written by D&D's cocreators Gary Gygax and Frank Mentzer. The Temple of Elemental Evil is fondly remembered by D&D fans for its meticulous adaptation of the scenario into the then newly released 3.5 edition. \"It may not be the best D&D game, but it is the most D&D game,\" PC Gamer's Jody Macgregor wrote back in 2017. \"Being alone at a computer isn't the same as sitting round a table shouting every time someone rolls a 20 or putting on a silly voice and making everyone laugh, but The Temple of Elemental Evil gets surprisingly close to recreating that atmosphere.\" The RPG has been quietly kept alive by modders for years. But now, more than two decades after it launched, The Temple of Elemental Evil is getting a proper Steam release. The RPG is being published by Sneg, a Nightdive Studios-ish outfit that has rere…",

And according to CEO Sam Altman, it's \"jaw droppingly good.\" To quote Altman in full on the the device, \"finally we have the first prototypes and I can't believe how jaw droppingly good the work is.\" But what, exactly, is it? Altman was recently joined on stage by Ive for an interview with the Emerson Collective . But both Altman and Ive were thoroughly cryptic when describing this AI \"thing\" they have created. It turns out that it was actually Ive that first contacted Altman with a \"tentative thesis\", a \"thought\", about the nature of objects and our interface with them. It was a very general idea, not a product. Which was...? \"It was to do with... no I can't share it, can I?\" Ive says. At most, Altman is willing to explain what he says is the \"vibe\" around the device. \"One of the things that has gone wrong is that when I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York, constantly dealing with all the little indignities along the way.

As spotted by Gematsu —part-time videogame age-rating board and full-time surprise spoiler (I ain't complaining), the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) recently surfaced a rating for a \"Windows PC\" version of Hideo Kojima's latest postman simulator. It's Mature 17+, in case you were wondering. This would suggest that DS2 is due for a release on god's own platform pretty sharpish, which might come as some surprise. It certainly surprised me. After all, the PS5 version of that game only released in June this year, and I still remember writing news stories about ex-PS boss Jim Ryan declaring that PC players would be waiting \" two or three years \" for the platform's exclusives to make the migration. But it wouldn't be so strange for DS2 to jump across so soon after its console launch. Death Stranding 1 , after all, came to PC in July 2020 after its initial PS4 release in November 2019, and it even came with glitzy add-ons, like a photo mode and some crossover stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if the second game got the same treatment. Of course, Sony and Kojim…",

    "body": "Trials in Arc Raiders is effectively a ranking system where you compete against other players for high scores on five challenges each week. When you complete a task for this week's challenges, you'll earn points towards that objective and earn a place on the leaderboard. The competition can get intense, to say the least. But if you're looking to earn all the unique Trials rewards, you're going to need to step up to the plate and give it a shot. Below, I'll go over all the Trials challenges this week and the best way to complete them for a high score. Arc Raiders Trials this week (Image credit: Embark) Right off the bat, it's important to understand how scoring works. Firstly, only your personal best score during a single run for each challenge contributes to your overall ranking, so you need to be prepared. Secondly, you can earn double Trial Score points when map conditions are active , such as Night Raid, Electromagnetic Storm, and Hidden Bunker, so you're always best off attempting the challenges on these runs. Plus, it's basically always easier to attempt these with two other players, not just because it's easier to stay alive, but also because the score is often shared, letti…",
