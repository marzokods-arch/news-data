You can get a taste of Regan's take on Lara in the new Tomb Raider announcement trailers—she sounds very Lara-like to me: And hey, just in case you haven't seen it, here's Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Regan's voice work can be heard briefly in this one too: Regan will take the place of Camilla Luddington, who handled the role over the previous three games in the series: Tomb Raider (the 2013 one, …",

But when you read the details about it in the press release on the matter, you'll see that it's a tad difficult to describe it all in just one sentence.

The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM).

Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh.

According to this post on X , AMD is looking for new hires with experience of \"taping out\" chips with \"PowerVia\" technology. \"This is HUGE!\" the post concludes. You heard it here first: AMD $AMD is planning to use Intel $INTC foundry to manufacture chips in the USA (not just packaging). During my job listing research, I uncovered a job listing posted by AMD that mentions Intel’s “PowerVia” under preferred experience… This is HUGE! pic.twitter.com/BSZgjadWDO December 12, 2025 For sure, the Intel connection is clear enough. \"PowerVia\" is Intel's branding for what's known more generically in the chip-making industry as backside power . In the simplest terms, it's a new technology that involves moving the power delivery networks in chips below the transistors. It's claimed to result in faster and more efficient chips. What's more, PowerVia is being introduced on Intel's upcoming Intel 18A node . Put all that together with Intel's stated desire to make chips for all comers on its new process nodes, the fact that \"taping out\"…",

Our greed knows no limit; it even surprised the devs. Speaking to our brand director, Tim Clark, and strategic director, Evan Lahti, Robert Sammelin, who is art director at Arc Raiders, revealed how the wall exploits were one of the more surprising community activities they witnessed players commit. (Image credit: Embark) \"There are quite a few things that have taken us by surprise,\" Sammelin says. \"Other things are sort of more or less known, because we have to continuously find ways to waterproof the experience and figure out how to mitigate anything that is either generally damaging exploits or just general bugs.\" I, for one, was sad to see the Dam Control wallhack kick the bucket, or I should say turn into an oven . \"But Elie, it's cheating!\" I hear some whiny voice say.

Developer Sandfall Interactive is so happy, in fact, that it just decided to do the developer equivalent of blowing a kiss: The \"Thank you\" update —that is literally what it's called—adds a bunch of content to the game for the low low price of 'nothin' but disk space', as seen in the trailer below. The full patch notes go into greater detail—I'll rattle off the smaller bits first before we get into the real meat, but to summarise: There's a photo mode, now; You can save \"up to 50 different lumina loadouts\", which is a tremendous quality of life improvement, and there are new filters for them. Lastly, you can abandon battles, rather than simply waiting to die if you messed up. I cannot understate how hyped I am for that lumina loadout detail. I'd estimate a good four to five hours of my 67 hour playtime in Clair Obscur was spent just messing around with my pictos in menus—and it was always agony when a singular fight forced me to custom-tun…",

As usual, some of the biggest announcements leaked in the few days (or hours) before the show, but this year had several big announcements that we're actually excited about—not just re-releases of remasters.

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play. What will really seal the deal for me is some kind of campaign or otherwise toothsome singleplayer structure, which remains an open question at the moment.
