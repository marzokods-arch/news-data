For those who are new to Genshin livestream codes, miHoYo puts on a live programme every six weeks, and as an incentive to tune in, it drops three codes you can redeem for Primogems with which to wish on new characters. In version 6.2, we have pyro and anemo characters coming in the form of Durin and Jahoda. We're also apparently getting reruns for Venti and Varesa, but this isn't 100% until the livestream airs. As always, I'll put the codes down below as they go live during the stream.

I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

Unlike the recently concluded October playtest, which was open to players in North America and Europe, this one in December will be accessible only to those in North America. Otherwise, it looks to be pretty much the same deal, including that it's invite-only, invitations cannot be shared, and the whole thing is \"strictly under an NDA,\" meaning you can't stream it or \"share your playtest experience publicly.\" That strikes me as not great. PC Gamer's senior video producer Scott Tanner just broke it to me that March 2026 isn't much more than three months away, and maybe I'm being a little alarmist but Bungie maintaining such a tight lid on Marathon at this late stage seems discomfitingly cautious for a game that was meant to be Bungie's next big thing.

Or, in some cases, just customising superficial elements of the UI to your liking—whether to combat colour blindness or for the aesthetic. And given how public Blizzard tends to be with WoW's betas, there's been a lot of hand-wringing. See, Blizzard's taken a sort of 'wipe the slate clean, then pare it back' approach. It's easier for UI designers to come down hard, then slowly make exceptions based on feedback. But given the enormity of this change, some players are getting a touch skittish.

For whatever it's worth, the layoffs will not have come as a surprise. Avalanche announced in the aftermath of Contraband's cancellation it had \"thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studio Group's long-term success.\" The answer was, of course, deep cuts. \"As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio,\" Avalanche said at the time, \"and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool.\" Studios in Malmö and Stockholm were also impacted, though have not been fully shuttered. That collective consultation has now wrapped up: \"We can now confirm that this process has concluded, that the studio has closed and that we have parted ways with 31 people,\" wrote Avalanche in a statement on its website . \"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,\" continued the statement. \"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contribution…",

The researchers from the University of Vienna (via The Register ) say that the data acquired would, \"to our knowledge, classify as the largest data leak in history, had it not been collated as part of a responsibly-conducted research study.\" But this \"leak\" may not quite be what it seems. The researchers claim to have scraped phone numbers, timestamps, \"about\" text, profile pictures, and public keys for E2EE encryption, the release of which, \"would entail adverse implications to the included users.\" So, what exactly is going on here and if you use WhatsApp do you need to be worried? This research relies on the fact that WhatsApp allows some user details to be acquired by inputting phone numbers. That includes the profile photos already mentioned. However, the key point is that users can opt to keep most of that data and profile images either entirely private or restricted to known contacts. Perhaps the only real surprise here is that the WhatsApp platform does not implement any explicit rate limits for querying phone numbers (at least it didn't before this research was conducte…",

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter.

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",
