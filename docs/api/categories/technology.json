After obtaining data, the group demanded that the victims pay hefty ransoms or see their confidential data published or sold. Bitcoin paid by victims recovered The unsealing of the document, filed in US District Court of the District of New Jersey, came the same day Jubair and another alleged Scattered Spider member—Owen Flowers, 18, from Walsall, West Midlands—were charged by UK prosecutors in connection with last year’s cyberattack on Transport for London .

Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly converge—for science. Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are a good-natured parody of the Nobel Prizes; they honor \"achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think.\" The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website. Read full article Comments",

A short time later, the robot arm positioned the spacecraft over an attachment port on the station's Unity module, and 16 bolts drove closed to create a firm mechanical connection with the ISS. The Cygnus XL supply ship will remain at the station for up to six months, during which time astronauts will unpack the spacecraft's cargo module and refill it with trash. The Cygnus spacecraft will depart the station and head for a destructive reentry over the remote Pacific Ocean to conclude the mission. Read full article Comments",

In a statement sent to Ars Technica, Samsung confirmed that it is “conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the US market.” Samsung currently lists nine Family Hub refrigerators in the US, which have MSRPs ranging from $1,800 to $3,500 . Family Hub fridges have 21.5- or 32-inch screens, which, until now, users have had autonomy over for displaying helpful or fun things, like photos and videos, memos, weather, timers, and a web browser.

    "summary": "In nuclear era, it has proven cheaper to build offensive weapons than play defense.",
    "body": "One thing that's evident about President Donald Trump's proposal for the Golden Dome missile defense shield is that designing, deploying, and sustaining it will cost a lot of money, at least several hundred billion dollars, over the course of several decades. Beyond that, it's really anyone's guess. That doesn't sit well with some lawmakers , but the Republican-controlled Congress committed $25 billion in July as a down payment for new missile-defense technologies. The White House stated in May that Golden Dome will cost $175 billion over three years, but a new study from a center-right think tank concludes that it is simply not enough to develop the kind of multi-layer shield Trump described in a January executive order. It's also clear that it will take longer than three years to implement the full spectrum of defense capability envisioned for Golden Dome. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but they can also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance, according to a new paper published in the journal Current Biology. It's a cognitively advanced ability known as \"label extension,\" and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, likens this ability to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that \"cup\" can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler, because they serve the same function. “The rock and the hammer look physically different, but they can be used for the same function,\" she said. \"So now it turns out that these dogs can do the same.” Fugazza and her Hungarian colleagues have been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years.

To be sure, Meta's first commercial smartglasses with a built-in display are a far cry from the Orion prototype Zuckerberg showed off last year. The actual \"display\" part of the Ray-Ban Display is a paltry 600×600 resolution square that updates at just 30 Hz and takes up a tiny 20-degree portion of only the right eyepiece. Compared to the 70-degree field-of-view and head-tracked stereoscopic 3D \"hologram\" effect shown on the Orion lenses, that's a little disappointing. Still, Zuckerberg was able to call the 42 pixels per degree (PPD) you get on the Ray-Ban Display's display \"very high resolution,\" in a sense (the Meta Quest 3 tops out at around 25 PPD across its much larger display).

Lost in the focus on Microsoft was something as, or more, urgent: never-before-revealed details that now invite scrutiny of Ascension’s own security failings. In a letter sent last week to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said an investigation by his office determined that the hack began in February 2024 with the infection of a contractor's laptop after they downloaded malware from a link returned by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The attackers then pivoted from the contractor device to Ascension’s most valuable network asset: the Windows Active Directory, a tool administrators use to create and delete user accounts and manage system privileges to them. Obtaining control of the Active Directory is tantamount to obtaining a master key that will open any door in a restricted building. Wyden blasted Microsoft for its…",

    "body": "Evolution has adapted the digits of mammals for an enormous range of uses, from our opposable thumbs to the spindly digits that support bat wings to the robust bones that support the hoofs of horses. But how we got digits in the first place hasn't been entirely clear. The fish that limbed vertebrates evolved from don't have obvious digit equivalents, and the most common types of fish just have a large collection of rays supporting their fins. Despite this uncertainty, we have identified some genes that seem to be essential for both digit formation and the development of rays in the fins of fish, suggesting that there are parallels between the two. But a new study suggests that these parallels are a bit of an accident, and digits come by re-deploying a genetic network that controls a completely different process: the formation of the cloaca, a single organ that handles all of the fish's excretion. Hox genes and digits One of the key regulators of limb development is a set of genes called homeobox proteins, which attach to DNA and regulate the activity of nearby genes. In animals, many of these homeobox, or hox genes, are formed into clusters. Mammals have four clusters of hox genes…",

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) called ex-CDC director Susan Monarez to review the chaos that has engulfed the public health agency under Kennedy. Monarez, a microbiologist and long-serving federal employee, led the CDC as the first Senate-confirmed director for just 29 days before her dramatic ouster last month . She appeared before the HELP committee alongside Debra Houry, the former chief medical officer for the CDC. Houry had worked at the agency for a decade—spanning four administrations and six directors— before resigning in protest against Kennedy's leadership soon after Monarez's ouster.
