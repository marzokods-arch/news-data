This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

The data provided by over 2,300 respondents offered a grim image of industry layoffs, as 28% of surveyed games industry workers reported that they had been laid off in the past two years. That percentage was even higher in the United States, where 33% of respondents said they'd been laid off during the same period. 17% of surveyed games industry workers reported having been laid off in just the last 12 months, while half of respondents said their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the last year. The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition. More than 16,000 games industry workers lost their jobs between January 2023 and January 2024. 2025 offered little reassurance that the losses would stabilize as job cuts continued at major companies like Microsoft, which dramatically downsized its gaming division while laying off…",

We only get one shot at this,\" a goggled Sam Fisher says in a recognizably Metal Gear Solid call screen. We then see a neck-down shot of Solid Snake skulking through a cloud of smoke, unholstering what appears to be a SOCOM pistol with an unusual sight. The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse.

I stumbled across Little Woody after playing one too many Arc Raiders matches. With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove.

Beyond the possibility of creating fabrics where every fibre is its own miniature system, the scientists say that the tech could also be leveraged into brain-computer interfaces. The study into the fabric-like tech was led by Professor Huisheng Peng at Fudan University. The researchers built circuits onto an elastic substrate, before rolling it into a thin, resilient fibre which can function as a complete microcomputer system. \"FICs can process both digital and analogue signals similar to commercial arithmetic chips and perform neural computing with high recognition accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art in-memory image process…",

    "body": "A hundred billion here, a hundred billion there. Pretty soon, you're talking about real money. Today, we have staggering but somehow unsurprising news of money approaching a total of $200 billion being pumped into AI and involving all the usual suspects: Meta, OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. First up is a report that Meta is planning to double its spending on AI this year to $135 billion. Let's just repeat that figure. $135 billion. It's an incredible amount of money. It's frankly incredible that Meta has that kind of money to spend speculatively on something that, currently, isn't proving lucrative for anyone apart from the people selling the picks and axes to help you search for the money. The BBC reports that Meta's CEO said yesterday that he expects \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\" Of course, you could argue that the big change in the way that Meta itself will \"work\" is that this spend represents a massive pivot away from virtual reality and the Metaverse, which was what Zuckerberg used to say would change the way we all work, in favour of AI. But what of OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon? Well, the story here is that the latter thr…",

After five years of remote consultancy work for Obsidian and some other unknown companies, Cain is now back in California working full-time for the Outer Worlds studio. In his latest YouTube video, he breaks down how those years went, how he feels about being back in an office compared to working remotely, and shares some insights all freelancers can relate to. Between June 2020 and December 2025, Cain was in what he called semi-retirement. He was still working on games as a consultant, but as a freelance, remote contractor. After moving to Seattle, he couldn't stay at Obsidian full time as it wasn't prepared to have out-of-state employees. He says that working on different games and with different teams was \"so much fun,\" but \"when you're a contractor you're constantly looking for the next thing.\" I freelanced for two years, and I never managed to escape that overwhelming feeling that I needed to find more work, so I completely understand why he went back to California and Obsidian. \"I'm not in charge of a project, I'm not a director,\" Cain says. \"You can think of it as more of a consultant. It's like what I was doing …",

The tech titan reported revenues of $81.27 billion , although its shares reportedly fell 4% after the announcement of slowing cloud growth. Swings and roundabouts, ey? But enough about the financials. The news I was most interested in came in MS CEO Satya Nadella's opening remarks , in which he revealed that its current OS has reached a significant milestone: \"One billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year\". It's not difficult to see why this might be the case. After all, Windows 10 experienced something of a slow death in 2025 , as Microsoft turned off the lights and pushed the majority of users over to Windows 11. Sure, there's the Extended Security Updates program for those that really want (or have) to dig their heels in, but otherwise it's unsurprising that vast numbers of regular PC users have eventually made the switch, reluctantly or otherwise. Not that Windows 11 is a particularly bad OS these days, at least in my opinion. It's had some seriously shaky moments , for sure, but as someone who uses it every day, I'd say it's currently in a reasonab…",

But amid all of this, there was also a severe DDoS attack , and the new update accidentally introduced a bunch of changes that Embark hadn't planned, and the devs have been trying to put things back to normal ever since. One of these temporary changes affected some firearms in Arc Raiders. \"Following yesterday's update, some weapons were affected by a bug that reduced their rate of fire,\" Embark community manager Ossen says on the official Discord . \"This was not an intentional change. We always aim to include all changes in our patch notes.\" (Image credit: Embark Studios) Unfortunately, it seems like this message wasn't able to permeate all corners of the Arc Raiders community. One player, who took the nerf particularly hard, or maybe just wanted an excuse for some spring cleaning, decided to take the opportunity to recycle all 109 Venators (via Nickmercs ) in their stash, as the gun had been hit particularly hard by the accidental nerf.
