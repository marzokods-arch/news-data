The game's lead game designer Michel Nohra confesses that they might've gone a little astray, there, per an interview with Edge magazine for Issue 419 (thanks, Gamesradar ): \"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now.\" See, while it's a safe assumption that Clair Obscur lets you keep playing after the credits roll, it's also a safe assumption that you're meant to do a little exploring first—more than that, Nohra explains, most players keep the final boss as a motivating carrot on the end of a stick: \"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content.

The members in question included Tom's Hardware , which reported on the Q&A session, and it was AMD's president of GPU Technologies and Chief Software Officer, Andrej Zdravković, who provided the pertinent answers. Tom's writes that, \"The software head responded that the accidental public release in August was unexpected, but that it intends to release the source for the FSR4 library while keeping the core technology closed, so as not to give Nvidia engineers an advantage.\" Technically, that's already happened, as back in August 2025, somebody at AMD accidentally uploaded source code for the FidelityFX SDK to GitHub , before swiftly removing it.

That's why in the bleak midwinter when the last thing I want to do is go outside, I look for games like the demo of Flock Around which let me birdwatch without feeling the bitter cold. Plus, you are almost guaranteed to see a cool bird, which is always a nice plus.

You can customise the colour, eyes, mouth, and clothing, but aside from that, there's not much going for you. That doesn't matter though, as you've got one job and one job only: take cool photos of the local wildlife. The demo gives you a guidebook with 20 birds to track down and photograph within, but with no clues or hints as to what to look for and what they sound like, so you best believe it's just a lot of point and click pictures and hoping for the best.

(Sony applied for the patent in 2023; these things take time.) The patent proposes an in-game interface that accepts \"natural language queries\" to identify which bit of the game you're stuck on, and then can either show you how to overcome the obstacle or take over and do it for you. I guess via possession? The \"ghost character\" who provides \"ghost assistance\" will be based on footage of other players, presumably scraped from YouTube by AI. There's already a Game Help feature on Playstation 5 that can bring up relevant videos when you're stuck, and this seems like a less jarring implementation of that. As far as throwing AI at videogames goes, it sounds pretty inoffensive to me. It's not costing anyone their job or, you know, devaluing the connection between artist and audience. If it means there's one less reason to splatter yellow paint telling us where to go all over videogames, this seems like a good thing. Of course, that's not how gamers have responded.

It's a respectable list, with a few familiar names both among the actors and the characters they'll be playing. Zip, Lara's tech guy introduced in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, will be played by Martin Bobb-Semple; Winston, the Croft family's long-suffering butler, will be played by Bill Paterson; Atlas de Mornay, Lara's uncle, will be played by Jason Isaacs. Having Uncle Atlas be played by the actor most famous as Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter—though he deserves to be just as well-known for playing Field Marshal Zhukov in The Death of Stalin and Enver Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3—suggests he might turn out to not be a supportive family member.

Always has been, always will be: I used to run Quake 2 at the most hideously low-spec settings possible, so I could squeeze a few more frames-per-second out of it and thus an edge over my online competitors. And I liked it! You won't be dueling with your fellow gamers in 007 First Light, no, but you may have to strike some sort of balance between pretty and performance. Luckily, it looks like there's a good bit of wiggle room in that regard.

    "body": "The PC gaming industry is now essentially a repeating cycle of product announcements generating an excitable 'ooh' followed immediately by a sigh of recognition: this isn't for me. Case in point is my reaction upon hearing about the \"most powerful gaming laptop on the planet\"— 'ooh!' —followed by the immediate dual recognition that this will be very expensive and probably very loud and scarcely worth unplugging from the mains— 'oh, yeah' . It is undeniably impressive, however, that MSI is packing very powerful hardware in such a small form factor. The company says about the Raider 16 Max HX and Raider 16 HX: \"Don’t let its size fool you. The Raider 16 Max HX is the world’s first gaming laptop capable of delivering a massive 300W total system power. Under full-load conditions, it unleashes 175W to the RTX 5090 or 5080, while simultaneously feeding 125W to the Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor—making it the most powerful gaming laptop on the planet.\" What's also impressive, and a welcome seeming trend for CES this year, is an element of modularity to these Raider laptops.

Announced at CES 2026 (via Wccftech ), Schenker has shown off the first semi-modular laptop based on Intel's Panther Lake. Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away. But even so, the remaining keyboard still sports a numpad (though the whole thing is too compact to be classed as full-sized) and the internal gubbins are respectable enough, if just not very potent. Not that HP is aiming the EliteBoard at gamers, of course. This is an AI PC for business users (the dedicated Copilot button really stands out), but if you got one with the best processor on offer, then you could do a spot of handheld-like gaming while pretending to juggle spreadsheets at work. The chip in question is an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro , which is a Kracken Point APU, with eight Zen 5 cores (4x Zen 5, 4x Zen 5c) and a Radeon 860M integrated GPU.

So why not put our idealist hats on for a bit and see that glass as half-full? I'll help us get started: There seem to be the slight rumblings of a focus on local rather than cloud AI by the big hardware companies, which could spell good news for the PC gaming industry and, dare I say it, the memory market. Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point. That was, of course, the idea with the \"AI PC\", a term Microsoft and co. has repeatedly jammed down our throat ever si…",
