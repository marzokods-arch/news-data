    "body": "For decades, space stations have been largely staffed by professional astronauts and operated by a handful of nations. But that’s about to change in the coming years, as companies including Axiom Space and Sierra Space launch commercial space stations that will host tourists and provide research facilities for nations and other firms.&nbsp; The first of those stations could be Haven-1, which the California-based company Vast aims to launch in May 2026. If all goes to plan, its earliest paying visitors will arrive about a month later. Drew Feustel, a former NASA astronaut , will help train them and get them up to speed ahead of their historic trip. Feustel has spent 226 days in space on three trips to the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.&nbsp; Feustel is now lead astronaut for Vast, which he advised on the new station’s interior design. He also created a months-long program to prepare customers to live and work there. Crew members (up to four at a time) will arrive at Haven-1 via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will dock to the station and remain attached throughout each 10-day stay. (Vast hasn’t publicly said who will fly on its first missions or…",

All good investment firms have a manifesto, right? This one argued for making bold bets on risky, world-changing technologies rather than chasing the tepid mundanity of social software startups. What followed, however, was a decade that got even more mundane. Messaging, ride hailing, house shares, grocery delivery, burrito taxis, chat, all manner of photo sharing, games, juice on demand, and Yo. Remember Yo? Yo, yo. It was an era defined more by business model disruptions than by true breakthroughs—a time when the most ambitious, high-profile startup doing anything resembling real science-based innovation was … Theranos? The 2010s made it easy to become a cynic about the industry, to the point that tech skepticism has replaced techno-optimism in the zeitgeist. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans more than improving the world. Sure, that industry created an obscene amount of wealth for a s…",

Picture all of it—every block and intersection, every neighborhood and park, as far as you can see—covered in sheets of paper. Now picture that paper filled with numbers. That’s one way to visualize a large language model, or at least a medium-size one: Printed out in 14-point type, a 200-­​billion-parameter model, such as GPT4o (released by OpenAI in 2024), could fill 46 square miles of paper—roughly enough to cover San Francisco. The largest models would cover the city of Los Angeles. We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who help build them. “You can never really fully grasp it in a human brain,” says Dan Mossing, a research scientist at OpenAI. That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

Those bump into other atoms, splitting them and causing them to emit more neutrons, which bump into other atoms, continuing the chain reaction.&nbsp; That reaction gives off heat, which can be used directly or help turn water into steam, which spins a turbine and produces electricity. Today, such reactors typically use the same fuel (uranium) and coolant (water), and all are roughly the same size (massive). For decades, these giants have streamed electrons into power grids around the world. Their popularity surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.&nbsp; A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases. China’s Linglong One, the world’s first land-based commercial small modular reactor, should come online in 2026. Construction cr…",

These engineering marvels are a new species of infrastructure: supercomputers designed to train and run large language models at mind-­bending scale, complete with their own specialized chips, cooling systems, and even energy supplies. Hyperscale AI data centers bundle hundreds of thousands of specialized computer chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), such as Nvidia’s H100s, into synchronized clusters that work like one giant supercomputer. These chips excel at processing massive amounts of data in parallel. Hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables connect the chips like a nervous system, letting them communicate at lightning speed. Enormous storage systems continuously feed data to the chips as the facilities hum and whir around the clock. Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into this infrastructure. Governments are spending big too. But the impressive computing power comes at a cost. The densely packed chips run so hot that air-conditioning ca…",

    "body": "For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. A sodium-ion battery works much like a lithium-ion one: It stores and releases energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. And while today’s sodium-ion cells are not meaningfully cheaper, costs are expected to drop as production scales. China, with its powerful EV industry, has led the early push. Battery giants CATL and BYD have invested heavily in the technology. CATL, which announced its first-generation sodium-ion battery in 2021, launched a sodium-ion product line called Naxtra in 2025 and claims to have already started manufacturing it at scale. BYD is also building a massive production facility for sodium-ion batteries in China.&nbsp; And the technology is already making it into cars. In 2024, JMEV began offering the option of buying its EV3 vehicle with a sodium-ion battery pack. HiNa Battery is putting sodium-ion batteries into low-spee…",

His parents signed him up . The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. They tested it in human cells, mice, and monkeys, and KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old . He later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Without a clear idea of what’s going on under the hood, it’s hard to get a grip on the technology’s limitations, figure out exactly why models hallucinate, or set guardrails to keep them in check. But last year we got the best sense yet of how LLMs function, as researchers at top AI companies began developing new ways to probe these models’ inner workings and started to piece together parts of the puzzle.&nbsp; One approach, known as mechanistic interpretability , aims to map the key features and the pathways between them across an entire model. In 2024, the AI firm Anthropic announced that it had built a kind of microscope that let researchers peer inside its large language model Claude and identify features that corresponded to recognizable concepts, such as Michael Jordan and the Golden Gate Bridge.&nbsp; In 2025 Anthropic took this research to another level , using its microscope to r…",
