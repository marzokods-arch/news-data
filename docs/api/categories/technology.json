Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view.

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

It uses the same hardware as the Windows model, including an 8.8-inch OLED display and AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. Pricing starts at $1,199, with availability expected in June 2026. Leaks in December suggested that Lenovo was preparing a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2 . It was presented as a possible alternative to the Windows model, targeting players who sought a more console-like experience on a handheld. It appears the rumors were true, as Lenovo has now officially announced that device at CES 2026. Unveiling the device, Lenovo appears to have formally titled it the Legion Go, powered by SteamOS (8.8”, 2). While the name is a bit clunky, it appears to simply describe the same second-generation Legion Go hardware, featuring an 8.8-inch display, this time running Valve’s operating system instead of Windows.",
