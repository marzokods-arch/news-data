And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna. Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Mexico's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans. Read full article…",

Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video.

Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.” \"It was a religion for me,\" del Toro said during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. \"Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested that Taiwan was currently mulling moving half its semiconductor supply chain to the US in exchange for \"some kind of security guarantee,\" as Taiwan faces the ongoing threat of a potential Chinese invasion. Trump has maintained since taking office that reshoring of semiconductor supply chains is critical for economic and national security, and Lutnick indicated that Taiwan should agree to the unusual terms because it needs the US for protection. But speaking Wednesday, Cheng said that while \"certain progress\" has been made in trade talks, Taiwan has not only made \"no such commitment\" but that \"this issue was not discussed in this round of negotiation, and we will not agree to such a condition,\" Bloomberg reported .

During last year's election, the Trump campaign made no secret of its disgust toward clean vehicles (and clean energy in general), and it promised to end subsidies meant to encourage Americans to switch from internal combustion engines to EVs. Once in power, the Republicans moved quickly to make this happen. Federal clean vehicle incentives had only recently been revamped in then-US President Joe Biden's massive investment in clean technologies as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 . To qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, a new EV had to have its final assembly in North America, and certain percentages of its battery content needed to be domestically sourced.

As much as I like the game, though, I've been surprised that it has actually grown over the past seven years. I'm not saying it's seen a full, No Man's Sky -like redemption story, though. It's still not for everyone, and in some ways, it has fallen behind the times since 2018. Nevertheless, the success of the streaming TV show based on the game franchise has attracted new players and given the developers a chance to seize the moment and attempt to complete a partial redemption story. To help make that happen, the game's developers will soon release an expansion fully capitalizing on that TV series for the first time, and I got to spend a few hours playing that update to see if it's any fun.

In such a climate, our most senior elected officials have a special duty to model truth-seeking behavior and responsible AI use. But what's the fun in that, when you can just blow up negotiations over a budget impasse by posting a deepfake video of your political opponents calling themselves \"a bunch of woke pieces of shit\" while mariachi music plays in the background?

It’s largely used for simple tasks unrelated to commerce, like setting timers and checking the weather. As a result, Amazon’s Devices business has reportedly been siphoning money , and the clock is ticking for Alexa to prove its worth. Alexa+, a subscription-based generative AI service ($20 per month or included with Prime, which starts at $15/month), is supposed to solve Amazon's woes with Alexa. More conversational and powerful than the original Alexa, Alexa+ is designed to play a more central role in user transactions, enabling, in theory, Amazon to finally make money from voice assistants after 11 years.
