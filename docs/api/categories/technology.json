Moore said: \"Our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world. We're just doing it through different channels … What's going on right now is that the TAM [total addressable market] and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.\" \"This is not a Micron issue, it's an industry issue, where us and our peers or our competitors are all rushing to service these segments as much as we can, and there's just not enough supply to go around … Memory manufacturers are scrambling to build newer production lines, yet constraints of the process eventually forces them to push the timelines ahead by several quarters, which means that for the average consumer, the DRAM shortages could persist for quite some time now, or at lea…",

No, something even more fundamental may be to blame here. The leaked missive is reportedly from Guangzhou Xinhongzheng Electronic Technology to its partners and claims price increases are the result of rising upstream raw material costs for copper, silver, and tin (via Videocardz ). The letter goes on to explain that new orders for CPU coolers will see a price increase ranging from 6% to 8%, and power supplies will be subject to an uptick between 6% and 10%.

Noctua recently took to its roadmap website ( archive from September 2025 ) to adjust the planned release of some upcoming gear. Notably, the Pulsar Feinman Noctua edition and NF-A12X25 G2 chromax.black have moved from the first quarter (Q1) of 2026 to Q2, and the Antec Flux Pro Noctua edition is now the only product set for release in Q1. The Pulsar Feinmann Noctua Edition, being a neat mouse with a fan in it , intrigued us last year, and a potential launch in Q2 means it will be here in time for the hottest months of the year. From Q2 estimations in the last roadmap, the 140 mm desk fan, USB fan controller and Seasonic Prime PX HPD Noctua edition have all moved back to Q3 this year. If the desk fan is anything like the 120 mm NV-FS1 , it will be pricey and very cool. I can't help but feel like there's a missed opportunity in not launching in the height of the summer, though.

Embark promised last week that it would begin dealing with cheaters , and now the \"significant changes\" to the detection and ban systems have arrived. \"Dear cheaters, the reckoning has begun,\" player Subsplot says in a Reddit post. \"Have fun trying to make up that expedition progress.\" The post also shares an image of a temporary suspension pop-up that is circulating Raider circles right now. (Image credit: Jinko on YouTube) It reads: \"Your account has been temporarily suspended for behaviour that violates our code of conduct. Your access will be restored: 2026.02.\" Which is a month from now, hence the 30-day ban. It's a great day for anyone who's been at the mercy of cheaters in Arc Raiders, even if Embark has been good enough to give loot back to those who have had it stolen by players who are cheating. But, as with anything, there are some who don't think the punishment has gone far enough. \"If they're cheating, then why isn't it permanent?\" one player asks. To which I say, because that's not how the cookie crumbles. Perman…",

Sorry, I've written so many articles about Steam's concurrent user records that I decided to try talking about it like a local news channel covering a bake sale, just to see how it feels. Anyway, over the weekend (Sunday, to be exact), Steam broached the 42 million concurrent user limit, hitting a new record of 42,042,778 users online at the same time (per SteamDB ). Not a bad way to kick off the year, if you're a titanic videogame storefront. Which, yes, on the one hand, is hardly a surprise. Steam's growth has been relentless and undaunted for ages. It hit 41 million in October , 40 million in March , and 39 million in December 2024 . I suspect I will see you back here in a few months when it hits 43 million. On and on it goes. But!

The AI boom has led to ever-increasing investment into the company, and so it's really in Nvidia's interest for the world to be all in on the potential benefits of AI. Huang reflects on the AI naysayers in a recent interview with No Priors (via Business Insider ). The Nvidia leaders and No Priors hosts Elad Gil and Sarah Guo venture down a lot of paths during the nearly 80-minute conversation, including what happens to jobs under an AI future, and when we might see a 'god AI'. One key point is the various narratives around the ethics of the machine learning tech. Huang argues the world of the future is one where AI leads to more jobs: \"People say, 'gosh, all of these robots that we're talking about. It's going to take away jobs'. As we know very clearly, we don't have enough factory workers. Our economy is actually limited by the number of factory workers we have.\" Huang therefore argues that robotics will lead to a huge repair industry, and that will naturally lead to more jobs.

It could be that Intel has never been planning to release such a GPU for the consumer market, and all of these rumours and leaks are for nought. But if the B770 is real, why didn't it appear at CES?

Not only will Divinity not carry forward the unique armor system Larian crafted for Divinity: Original Sin 2, my coworkers keep bashing it. PCG guides writer Rory Norris called it \"broken\" in giant letters on our front page. I forget what PCG news writer Morgan Park said to me exactly during our Friday meeting, but it was something like D:OS2's armor system sucks, I'm stupid for liking it, and I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells and I like to kiss my own butt . There is nothing out there like D:OS2's armor system. It lends the game a combat rhythm that is completely unique among CRPGs, and I was thrilled at the prospect of Larian returning to it with fresh eyes and a Baldur's Gate 3's worth of design experience. The saving grace here is the possibility of something new and even better, but I can't let the moment pass without sticking up for my fav. Far out, man Crowd control⁠—stuns, knockdowns, anything that hampers an enemy or player instead of directly damaging them⁠—is a key part of RPG combat, but it's almost always based on a certain amount of random chance…",

Still, things seem to have gotten much worse in recent years, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Friday to discuss the issue of \"arguing about games\" at length . \"People have always had different tastes and they wanted different things,\" Cain said in the video. \"I think each one of you, individually, knows what you want. Where things break down is, you don't seem to realize or recognize that there's a lot of other people out there and they all want different things. And this isn't just gamers, developers do this too.\" Cain acknowledged there's no right way to make a game; disagreements over how to properly optimize a game, what features do and don't belong, and so on all come up during the dev cycle and years after a game has released. An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste.

One other use that was shot down definitively, however, is AI-generated text, placeholder or final. User AmihanTheStoic asked about AI text in the context of the no AI art promise. Specifically, how generated placeholder text helps development, and whether \"good enough\" AI placeholder text might make it to the final game, voiding Larian's promise to keep generated assets out of Divinity. Comment from r/Games \"The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity,\" said writing director Adam Smith . \"To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'—it doesn't. \"We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those …",

Digital Anvil's third-person space-sim was conceived by Roberts in the late nineties. But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

As part of Larian's big Divinity AMA on Reddit , the game's writing director, Adam Smith, revealed how the studio is factoring players' save scumming tendencies into its next game's design. For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment. We already have to live with our mistakes in real life, why do so in our fantasies? Comment from r/Games The big Baldur's Gate 3 example has to be quickloading every time you fail a skill check until the 20-sided dice finally lands your way.
