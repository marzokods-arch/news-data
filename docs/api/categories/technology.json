A while back, I proclaimed that the old-school MMOs we all used to play are dead, and that we have killed them . I still mostly stand by that opinion, but I now have a major exception: The old sense of discovery, community, and mythology in these MMORPGs is alive and well in an air-pocket, deep under a sea of disseminated knowledge: It lives on in challenge running. I spoke with Final Fantasy 14's \"Solo Only\", otherwise known as RathGames , who I've been following on YouTube for a while. Rath has been chewing his way through the game's 400+ hour main questline in considerably more time, for one very important reason: He plays the game solo.

Now though, veteran publisher MicroProse has just released Neyyah . That may read like onomatopoeia for the noise Minecraft villagers make, but it is in fact a first-person 3D point 'n' click puzzler, one that doesn't so much wear its Myst inspirations on its sleeve as have them tattooed all over its body. Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below. The 3D environments certainly look the part, though I'm less sold on the FMV cutscenes used to tell the story, which have a (somewhat endearing, in all fairness) am-dram quality about them.

That's essentially what's being suggested in a report by The Financial Times (via Reuters ), which claims that OpenAI has signed a deal with US semiconductor firm Broadcom to design and manufacture its own machine learning processors, for internal use next year. This is backed up by a statement from Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, who said that the company had secured $10 billion in AI system orders from a 'new customer', which should result in significant revenue growth in 2026. As things currently stand, OpenAI uses large-scale computer systems with Nvidia chips for AI model training and inference. It's not the only company to do so, of course, which is why Nvidia's data centre division pulled in a total $115.2 billion last year—more than AMD and Intel's entire revenues combined. And it's not just a cas…",

We have, of course, been 'proving' we're human for many years now, though it's always been easy to forget that's what those CAPTCHA tasks are up to. Now, though, with AI becoming increasingly able to beat Turing tests and the likes, it's increasingly important to be able to verify whether someone online is a person or a bot. So, lest we head towards a vindication of the dead internet theory , we also need increasingly more accurate methods for distinguishing neurons from silicon. This is no less true for gaming than anywhere else. Players using bots to cheat in online games is a real problem , and as AI gets more sophisticated, we can only assume the problem will get worse. Anti-cheats tackle this issue from one angle—checking program executables and so on—but another way of tackling it is to check that a user is a live person, a method that is often called 'liveness detection' or 'proof-of-human'. I've spent the last week or so speaking to various expert humans and industry insiders to see what the state of play is for proof-of-human tech in gaming, and whether these technologies might pose an…",

Examples include MS-DOS and GW-BASIC , and now another blast from the past has been added to the collection. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

And in certain cases, it can be so bad that the impact it's having on your livelihood ultimately forces you to do one thing: file a lawsuit against your famous namesake. This is exactly what's happened with an Indiana-based lawyer called Mark S. Zuckerberg, as reported by TechCrunch . Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed. This has apparently been going on for so long that Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta for breach of contract and other aspects. Yes, I know he's not directly naming the other Mark Zuckerberg, but arguably, he is, in jus…",
