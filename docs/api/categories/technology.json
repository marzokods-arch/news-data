Hence, his location. Johnson&#8217;s reference to the shadows in his hotel room has to do with his college major: theatrical lighting design at Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana. (He grew up in Alexandria.) Although he had done stand-up at open mics while in college, Johnson says that his decision to commit to a career in comedy happened after he moved to Chicago. &#8220;I moved there to start doing stand-up,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but I think if I got a couple of design jobs here and there, or had a fast track to the union, it would have been a slightly different story.&#8221; …",

As opposed to other pass types — store loyalty cards or concert tickets, for example — private passes come with extra security features meant to help keep critical information attached to documents like government IDs or health insurance cards private. One of those security features is that private passes can only exist on a single device at one time, but it looks like that could be changing. Experimenting with the latest version of Google Play services, we spotted code that indicates Google Wallet might soon incorporate features that will allow users to transfer private passes between devices, or even sync them between multiple concurrent devices.",

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips.

It follows Samsung Health’s recent upgrade that added smarter wellness insights and body-tracking tools, making the app feel more like a true fitness hub.

However, only the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a Snapdragon SoC. The base Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S26 Plus could come with the Exynos 2600 instead. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also staring at an imminent price increase. The Galaxy S26 series has been a hot topic of discussion, more so than recent Galaxy S series flagships. The big reasons for this are the leaks and demise of the Galaxy S26 Edge (and even a “More Slim” reincarnation ), the death of the Galaxy S26 Pro , and the revival of the Galaxy S26 Plus — all before Samsung could make a public announcement. We’re receiving more leaks, bringing good news for early 2026 release and availability, but bad news for Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus’ SoC, and bad news for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s price tag.

If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles).

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses.

Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?
