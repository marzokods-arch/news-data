But it seems id Software has had a rethink about the Ripatorium, as The Dark Ages' latest update substantially overhauls how it works. While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format. Previously, players only had broad control over an encounter, able to select enemies they wanted to fight, dictate number of times enemies would respawn and choose whether or not to set a time limit or to s…",

And by lying, well, what I really mean is rendering video somewhere other than inside the actual window that was open on your desktop—sort of a parallel plane of existence to the desktop you were actually looking at—before sneakily porting it over. If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The fact that people are unimpressed that we can have a fluent conversation with a super smart AI that can generate any image/video is mindblowing to me.\" The comment comes as the public reacts to Microsoft pushing its new \"agentic\" services , referring to AI agents that can perform tasks beyond chatting and generating images. Windows head Pavan Davuluri said earlier this month that Microsoft's OS is \"evolving into an agentic OS,\" and I can't say I'm excited about the prospect. Suleyman's inability to comprehend that lack of enthusiasm can easily be resolved with a classic technique from ancient philosophy, or maybe it was an ad for taco shells , in which one accepts two different things at the same time. In this case, I think that generative AI models are very novel and that it's absolutely appropriate to be curious about the ways in which they mimic human creativity and reason, and without contradicting m…",

It's a great example of the sort of clever data-based trinket that grabs the internet's attention every so often, like Asteroid Launcher , Subway Builder , or today's Jmail , which lets you browse more than 2,000 of Jeffrey Epstein's emails in a fake Gmail inbox.

Okay, no points for originality there, but the game also promises \"a focus on exploration and discovery rather than pure survival and combat,\" which I do find interesting.

That's per an interview contained in a paperback guide for the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (thanks, GamesRadar+ ). Co-director Ari Gibson told ACMI that Silksong was intended to \"stand alongside Hollow Knight,\" and that the two games \"really complement each other\". However, Gibson also notes that \"I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, travelling back to the original game after playing Silksong. And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern—that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another.\" Keep in mind that this interview seemingly dates before Silksong's release (earli…",

All you really have to do is find a footlocker in an apartment building for Tian Wen. The only problem? There are multiple apartment areas on Dam Battlegrounds, each with their own separate buildings. Sure, you'll find it if you methodically search, but if you want to know its exact location and speed things up a bit, I'll explain exactly where to find Major Aiva's footlocker below. You'll also have to extract an item to complete the quest. While there are plenty of extract points nearby, and Dam Battlegrounds is one of the safest maps, you might want to use a safe pocket instead of a free loadout . Search for Major Aiva's mementos in the apartments northwest of The Dam The footlocker is in the 2nd floor apartment of the southwest building at Ruby Residence (Image credit: Embark Studios) First, you'll need to head to the Ruby Residence area in the north of Dam Battlegrounds, to the northwest of the Hydroponic Dome Complex, and to the west of the Generator Halls and Power Generation Complex.

So that was a bit of a damp squib, but it doesn't mean nothing of note came from the report itself. For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"? No? How odd. After all, Guillemot points out that AI is \"as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on the front\" which certainly has the tenor of something that should get us all very excited. Guillemot and Ubisoft have been banging the AI drum for a while now. Last year, it unveiled its AI-powered \" neo-NPCs ,\" promising that \"each conversation between the player and an NPC\" would be \"unique and responsive to the players and their actions, leading to fully personalized and immersive experiences.\" So, …",

I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people.

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic.
