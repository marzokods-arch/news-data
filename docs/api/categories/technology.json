Whether that's for a specific weather condition, or just sitting around waiting for crops to grow or flowers to respawn, I've spent hours just twiddling my thumbs, desperate to tick a quest off my to-do list. But with the new Dream Team feature coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley as part of the Winter Ball update on Wednesday, December 10, this problem might be removed entirely. In a reel posted to the Disney Dreamlight Valley YouTube channel , more details have been shown about what exactly this feature does. With this addition, you'll be able to join forces with a group of seven friends, give yourself a name, motto, and a logo, and then start requesting materials. This can be anything from crafting materials like clay and iron, to quest items like fish, flowers, and crops. If you'd rather fulfil a request from your friend instead, it's just as easy as placing one. When you're in the Dream Teams menu, you'll see every item that each of your friends has asked for. Click on the one you have, and you'll be asked if you want to trade. By agreeing, your items will immediately be shipped off to your p…",

    "body": "The best thing about gaming is that unlike dusty old cinema, it's young enough that we're still in that exciting moment where there are new genres and genre mashups to explore. Luna Abyss, which we just got a fresh glimpse of during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, is a first-person bullet hell that looks like Doom had a run-in with Yoko Taro. Download the demo Download the Luna Abyss demo on Steam The new trailer is a tension-ratcheting mood piece that gives us a better look at the world, enemy design, gunplay, and movement. The camera pans across labyrinthine pipework and imposing gothic structures silhouetted by throbbing red neon. It's industrial, alien, and dystopian in equal measure. We get small snippets of the creatures that inhabit this world: fleshy, twisted patchworks of metal and skin that seem to leer at us like they're possessed. It's proper nightmare fuel, the kind of monsters dreamt up by Giger or Beksiński, or that nasty neighbour kid from Toy Story. Scene set, and it's onto the action. It's not long before we see why the first-person bullet hell's twist is no gimmick—facing down a hail of projectiles feels a whole lot more imposing when they're barreling directly…",

Developed by Afrime Studios—a majority black-owned developer with a specific goal to \"tell their story their way\"—Unyverse marries ancient tradition inspired by African cultures with advanced sci-fi tech. Quadrupedal robots stalk the perimeter of a savannah outpost, geodesic dwellings dotting the background with traditional patterns adorning their domes. Later on, we see grand hallways lined with towering statues, then desert monuments sat beneath huge waterfalls, only to cut to a sleek bar that wouldn't look out of place in Cyberpunk 2077 . And what would a modern RPG be without a character creator you could spend more time in than in the entirety of some singleplayer campaigns?

Discretion is, therefore, advised. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist When Sirens Fall Silent on Steam The trailer begins with a close up shot of legs clad in brown corduroy and wearing leather boots. They step purposefully across a dank and dilapidated stone-tile floor, trailing a metal chain behind them in the kind of opening that would make even Silent Hill's Pyramid Head wince in fear. Having received a \"disturbing video tape\", the presenter of a '90s-style late night TV show opts to air it to the public in the hopes that it \"will help keep this young girl safe.\" The girl in the video is chained around her neck with sparkling earrings adorning a goth-club-worthy outfit, complete with red leather jacket.

Join the beta Join the Spellcasters Chronicles beta on Steam Rather than a top-down view, you get an over-the-shoulder perspective that puts you right in the middle of the action. And especially intriguing to card gamers like myself, it's also a deckbuilder in which you can construct and expand a deck of incantations and summons that help shape your strategy. Of course, being a MOBA, the goal is to destroy your opponent's life stone by wresting control over the map lanes and capturing altars to help you build your army. Let's put the cool mechanics aside for a second though, because what totally steals the limelight in the closed beta trailer are the stunningly expressive character designs and art direction.

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival now on Steam In an interview aired along with cinematic and dev diary footage during the show, game director Emil Esov and narrative director Antony De Fault spoke about their upcoming game: \"a discomforting and dark story,\" according to Esov. This singleplayer horror spectacle doesn't shun the taboo indulgences of sadism and masochism, but instead embraces them in their most brutal and visceral form. \"Anything less would not be a Hellraiser game\", says Esov. As they speak, scenes of intensely violent melee combat between the player and leather-clad assailants—I imagine emboldened by their immense pain thresholds—flash across the screen.
