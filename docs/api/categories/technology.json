Videogames are nothing if not proof of a near-universal fascination with the idea of people hitting each other with objects, and Half Sword's physics-based simulation of 15th century martial combat takes that grisly spectacle to a bloody, often clumsy extreme. (Image credit: Half Sword Games) Created in consultation with practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts, Half Sword aims for authentic representation of historical weaponry, armor, and techniques from historical combat manuals. And the results of when those hits land are simulated with similar realism, as evidenced by Half Sword's regular dismemberments and disembowelings. In my case, a few of those dismemberments have been self-inflicted. Turns out your sword doesn't get any less sharp if you have a rough landing while your physics-enabled limbs get tangled with your …",

Or something else entirely? In an interview with PC World , Intel's long-suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has tried to clear things up. But we've come away if anything more confused. And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage. Another oddity is that while the slide refers to both Xe2 and Battlemage, it only calls out Xe3 and not the \"Celestial\" generational codename that has previously been attached to Xe3.

Chief among my complaints was its lack of integration with common Windows features, but it looks like that's about to get a boost—as the latest Windows Insider build allows users to request changes to their PC settings through Copilot, to which it will respond with an appropriate link. Microsoft says that Copilot app update 1.25095.161 is already beginning to roll out across all Windows Insider channels, and that asking it to \"make my screen easier to read\" or \"help me focus by reducing distractions\" will cause it to guide users to the relevant Windows settings page, complete with a brief summation of how to make the changes they seek. Which sort of feels like a tacit admission that Windows settings are a bit of a mess , doesn't it? Anyway, this actually seems like useful functionality for your everyday user, something that Copilot has always had the promise of delivering, but in many cases has come up short. I often act as tech support for the majority of my family and friends, and much of that comes down to pointing them towards a setting that does exactly what they're asking for, but is tucked away in …",

It's no wonder the Portal has been inundated with XP farms to the point that it quite literally doesn't function properly right now. Of course, there are the assignments. Ahh, the assignments. Completing odd and often challenging tasks has always been one of the highlights of the series for me, but Battlefield 6's assignments are very grindy, and there are a good few that are very hard to complete by yourself. The biggest issue right now, however, is that it's a Sisyphean task: there's a prevalent bug preventing assignments tracking whatsoever for some players, or not tracking accurately in other cases. Healing 5,000 damage from teammates or getting kills while buffed by a stim is one thing, but when none of it is counted and you're not making any progress at all, it's a frustrating mess. That's not to mention that some of the assignment descriptions are actually incorrect. For example, the Rapid Fire assignment to unlock additional assault rifles tasks …",

By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,\" the announcement says. That implies OpenAI wants to at least try to do its own thing with AI hardware rather than be entirely at the mercy of Nvidia and, to a lesser extent, AMD. But arguably the bigger intrigue involves the financial implications of yet another big hardware deal from OpenAI. Lest you have forgotten, in recent weeks OpenAI has announced a $300 billion deal for cloud computing services with Oracle, a complex deal with Nvidia worth at least $100 billion , followed by yet another deal with Nvidia's arch rival, AMD, that's worth at minimum tens of billions of dollars .

    "body": "World of Warcraft will strip away mods , or addons, with the ability to process information in combat when the upcoming Midnight expansion releases. And that idea is now changing many core aspects of the game, its director says. In an exclusive PC Gamer interview, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas says that over the years, the game has gotten increasingly complex. He goes on to explain upcoming changes to encounter and class design. \"If you're playing it out of the box, no addons whatsoever, and trying to play at the highest competitive levels, I do think that it is too hard,\" he says, \"and I think that consequently, hardly anyone is attempting to do that.\" Midnight aims to change that dynamic. Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions. But the idea of taking away mods and WeakAuras' ability to read combat information swiftly required tweaks to nearly every part of the game's group activities. Every Warcraft class is changing at Midnight (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) Encounters had to become easier for players to read, since addons couldn't give them simple…",

Yesssss. This is the Star Trek-level technology I was promised as a child. Well, maybe that's jumping the gun a bit. Still, the achievement here is incredibly impressive (via Tom's Hardware ). Essentially, the researcher's new Atom2chip process allowed them to flow a layer of molybdenum disulphide , functioning as a memory array, on top of a 0.13 micrometre CMOS silicon chip—fusing together an emerging atomic-scale, \"2D\" technology with traditional methods to create a working hybrid memory chip. The chip-riding 2D flash memory array is able to communicate with the CMOS chip's control logic via a custom interface, which in turn means that instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism and random access instructions can be swapped between the two. And the deeper you go, the more impressive the scale of the achievement becomes. While wafers are polished…",

After over a year of griping about Dawntrail's story , griping about Dawntrail's release schedule , and griping about Forked Tower , I'm finally logging back into Final Fantasy 14 again on a regular basis. More than that, I'm actually having fun. I'm having fun playing an MMORPG, it finally happened! Alright, I'm being snippy—which you can't hold against me because I'm writing this on a Monday—but in all seriousness, it's not like Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail's had nothing to do. Assuming you like raiding. But the ills of the casual/midcore content drought and an over-reliance on one-and-done activities has made the game suffer for some time. Don't take my word for it, listen to director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) , who has outlined a desire to make more variable difficulties after the whole Forked Tower snafu saw only a sliver of the playerbase engaging with it: \"I do feel that Forked Tower: Blood was a misstep in development … we made it too difficult for players to even get into the raid in the first place.\" In other intervie…",

Pitchford can't help himself, but he comes across way better in an actual conversation than his social media persona might suggest. He recently did an interview with the BBC to discuss Borderlands 4, and Gearbox's history more generally, in which he basically humblebrags about what Borderlands gets right, during which I think he claims it basically encapsulates the human experience? \"[Gearbox's] mission is to entertain the world,\" said Pitchford. \"Which means we suck!

That's according to the Financial Times , which cites \"two people familiar with the plans\" and says the two new hires, Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, have experience working on world models. Apparently, the creations are intended to help create game environments. That tracks, too, given Musk's previous comments : \"The XAI game studio will release a great AI-generated game before the end of next year.\" If these world models are put towards game world creation, I'm sure we'll have a whole bunch of new AI slop to look forward to. I mean, just look at the aforementioned X post—Musk is responding to a clip of a game that looks absolutely atrocious. I'm sure it will allow for lots of bespoke and custom game scenes, of course.
