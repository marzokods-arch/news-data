The new SwitchBot Weather Station features a 7.5-inch E-Ink display that keeps key household and weather data visible at a glance, without the glare or distractions of a tablet-style screen. It’s meant to live on a counter or entry table, surfacing the information you want before heading out the door. As LCD smart displays continue creeping into more corners of the home, SwitchBot’s E-Ink Weather Station feels like a quieter alternative and a calmer way to keep tabs on your environment.",

Among the many renewable energy sources, solar never goes out of fashion. With the energy demand in the US expected to reach a record high, especially due to the steep increase in power requirements for AI data centers, it is in your best interest to invest in an alternative source of energy.

All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority If you’ve considered building or upgrading a PC lately, you’ve likely noticed the shockingly high price of memory . RAM kits that sold for reasonable sums just a year ago now routinely cost two to three times as much, and prices continue to rise while some sets are increasingly challenging to obtain entirely. Smartphone owners may feel insulated from these swings, since we don’t buy or install mobile RAM ourselves. However, the same forces driving up PC memory prices are quietly reshaping the smartphones we may plan to purchase next year. Here’s what you need to know.",

It’s a fair question. After all, the most transformative AI tools — from ChatGPT to NotebookLM — run in the cloud. There is currently a split between “visible AI” (the chatbots we communicate with) and “invisible AI” (the magical features many don’t realize use AI), but the heavy lifting is often done remotely. This split has contributed to AI fatigue, as users see high-end NPUs as expensive overkill for features that require an internet connection anyway.",

Even if you have the means to pick one up on a whim, just being a very fast car doesn’t necessarily make it the ideal vehicle for every occasion — god forbid you need to store anything in the trunk. That same situation applies to smartphones and the chips powering them. Every year, we see companies like Qualcomm introduce their latest silicon, trying to wow us with performance metrics that make the previous generation’s chips look positively glacial in comparison. That’s an important part of progress, absolutely, but just because there’s a new super-high-end option out there doesn’t mean it’s the best chip for the phone you need.",
