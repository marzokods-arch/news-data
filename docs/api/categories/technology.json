As the name suggests, foveated streaming is used during the latter. \"So, a lot of people might have heard of foveated rendering,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve working on the Steam Frame, says. \"That's where you use the direction you're looking at to optimise what the device is doing. So it only has to do a lot of work in that area. We are doing something similar to that dedicated to the streaming process.\" Foveated streaming requires the Steam Frame's new eye tracking feature. This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time. The clearest patch of your vision, that's thanks to your fovea, hence the name. Connecting to a PC via its own wireless adapter and a dedicated 6 GHz connection, the Steam Frame h…",

This is a complex story, but to précis the salient details, the use of extreme ultraviolet light to shrink down chip components to smaller proportions than ever before throws up some rather peculiar problems, leading to flaws when transferring the patterns contained in the lithography masks to the silicon wafers. In simple terms, it comes down to the way the EUV light diffracts and distorts as it passes through the various lenses, reflectors and apertures of the mind-boggling complex ASML lithography machines used by TSMC to manufacture the most advanced chips.

As most of my friends and family use the service, I've got the old WhatsApp version open on my machine at all times. It's currently sitting at 124.6 MB of RAM usage with many ongoing chats open, so this sounds like a significant downgrade for an app that, for many, is their primary way of keeping in touch with their pals. I haven't received the update yet, so I've been unable to test it myself to confirm these figures.
