On Thursday, researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute released a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data. That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats. The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.

Per the official premise: A century before the events of Game of Thrones , two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named \"Dunk,\" along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka \"Egg,\" a child prince and Dunk's squire.

There were even external cheat devices that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended. While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix announced that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade would include new \"streamlined progression\" features.

This is the third interstellar object astronomers have detected within our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov discovered in 2017 and 2019. Scientists think interstellar objects routinely transit among the planets, but telescopes have only recently had the ability to find one. For example, the telescope that discovered Oumuamua only came online in 2010. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called moai , built some 800 years ago and typically mounted on platforms called ahu . Scholars have puzzled over the moai on Easter Island for decades, pondering their cultural significance, as well as how a Stone Age culture managed to carve and transport statues weighing as much as 92 tons. One hypothesis, championed by archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University, among others, is that the statues were transported in a vertical position, with workers using ropes to essentially \"walk\" the moai onto their platforms. The oral traditions of the people of Rapa Nui certainly include references to the moai \"walking\" from the quarry to their platforms, such as a song that tells of an early ancestor who made the statues walk. While there have been rudimentary field tests showing it might have been possible, the hypothesis has also generated a fair amount of criticism. So Lipo has co-authored a new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science offering fresh experimental evidence of \"walking\" moai, based on 3D modeling of the physics and new field tests to recreate that motion. The first Europeans arrived in the 17…",

    "body": "Stoke Space announced a significant capital raise on Wednesday, a total of $510 million as part of Series D funding. The new financing doubles the total capital raised by Stoke Space, founded in 2020, to $990 million. The infusion of money will provide the company with \"the runway to complete development\" of the Nova rocket and demonstrate its capability through its first flights, said Andy Lapsa, the company's co-founder and chief executive, in a news release characterizing the new funding. Stoke is working toward a 2026 launch of the medium-lift Nova rocket . The rocket's innovative design is intended to be fully reusable from the payload fairing on down, with a regeneratively cooled heat shield on the vehicle's second stage. In fully reusable mode, Nova will have a payload capacity of 3 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, and up to 7 tons in fully expendable mode. Read full article Comments",

He had abnormalities in his lungs, intestines, blood, liver, and lymphatic system—and, of course, no single clear explanation. His case was such a riddle that a master clinician with an expertise in clinical reasoning was called in to help unravel it. In a case report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the expert and the man's other doctors lay out the masterful medical deduction that explained his remarkable case—which had an entirely unremarkable cause. It all started about two weeks before his hospital visit. A mild, dull pain had developed in the patient's right lower abdomen and back. Nine days later, a fever and body aches also developed. The next day, he went to urgent care, where clinicians gave him intravenous fluids and an intravenous pain reliever. His abdominal pain went away, and he was discharged. But the pain returned over the next few days, and with it came nausea and vomiting. He then started coughing and having trouble breathing. Read full article Comments",

The UK central bank said US stock valuations resemble those seen near the peak of the dotcom bubble on some measures, with AI-focused companies making up an unprecedented portion of market value. In its quarterly report derived from a meeting of its Financial Policy Committee that took place last week, BoE wrote that \"the risk of a sharp market correction has increased.\" Reuters notes that it's the BoE's strongest warning to date about potential AI-driven market declines. The committee, chaired by Governor Andrew Bailey, said spillover risks to Britain's financial system from such a shock were \"material.\" Read full article Comments",

Responding to a request from cable and telecom lobby groups, he is proposing to eliminate a rule that requires ISPs to itemize various fees in broadband price labels that must be made available to consumers. The rule took effect in April 2024 after the FCC rejected ISPs' complaints that listing every fee they created would be too difficult. The rule applies specifically to recurring monthly fees \"that providers impose at their discretion, i.e. , charges not mandated by a government.\" ISPs could comply with the rule either by listing the fees or by dropping the fees altogether and, if they choose, raising their overall prices by a corresponding amount. But the latter option wouldn't fit with the strategy of enticing customers with a low advertised price and hitting them with the real price on their monthly bills. The broadband price label rules were created to stop ISPs from advertising misleadingly low prices. Read full article Comments",
