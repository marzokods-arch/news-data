Arrowhead dropped a new video today that covers how future updates will roll out.

In an exclusive PC Gamer interview, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas says that over the years, the game has gotten increasingly complex. He goes on to explain upcoming changes to encounter and class design. \"If you're playing it out of the box, no addons whatsoever, and trying to play at the highest competitive levels, I do think that it is too hard,\" he says, \"and I think that consequently, hardly anyone is attempting to do that.\" Midnight aims to change that dynamic. Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions. But the idea of taking away mods and WeakAuras' ability to read combat information swiftly required tweaks to nearly every part of the game's group activities.

A team of scientists at Fudan University in Shanghai have published a study detailing their latest achievement, a fully functional memory chip built with integrated 2D materials a few atoms thick. Yesssss. This is the Star Trek-level technology I was promised as a child. Well, maybe that's jumping the gun a bit. Still, the achievement here is incredibly impressive (via Tom's Hardware ). Essentially, the researcher's new Atom2chip process allowed them to flow a layer of molybdenum disulphide , functioning as a memory array, on top of a 0.13 micrometre CMOS silicon chip—fusing together an emerging atomic-scale, \"2D\" technology with traditional methods to create a working hybrid memory chip. The chip-riding 2D flash memory array is able to communicate with the CMOS chip's control logic via a custom interface, which in turn means that instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism and random access instructions can be swapped between the two. And the deeper you go, the more impressive the scale of the achievement becomes. While wafers are polished…",

More than that, I'm actually having fun. I'm having fun playing an MMORPG, it finally happened! Alright, I'm being snippy—which you can't hold against me because I'm writing this on a Monday—but in all seriousness, it's not like Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail's had nothing to do. Assuming you like raiding. But the ills of the casual/midcore content drought and an over-reliance on one-and-done activities has made the game suffer for some time. Don't take my word for it, listen to director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) , who has outlined a desire to make more variable difficulties after the whole Forked Tower snafu saw only a sliver of the playerbase engaging with it: \"I do feel that Forked Tower: Blood was a misstep in development … we made it too difficult for players to even get into the raid in the first place.\" In other intervie…",

But what was certain was that a large chunk of the VRMs were now missing, which meant power could no longer reach the chip itself (via Videocardz ). However, YouTuber Paulo Gomes took it upon themselves to see what they could do for the stricken graphics card, and arrived at an unusual solution: wiring in the VRMs still attached to an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card to provide electrical assistance to the fallen RTX 5070 Ti . And holy hell, it appears to have worked. The AMD card was rigged with a series of electrical wires to bypass the missing VRMs, and was left riding piggyback aboard its much-more-powerful competitor. There's something uncomfortably medical about the whole affair, what with the sequence of wires resembling hospital tubes—but lo and behold, the RTX 5070 Ti now provides an output signal once more.

Some of those mods can be brutal, like bonus health to all monsters or full immunity to certain types of elemental damage. The point of the system is to pick and choose which mods your character can handle. But it also means you can create maps that are so nasty that even the best players can't survive.

That's hard to say, but it's certainly a part of Microsoft's future; on top of pushing Copilot as a non-negotiable part of the Microsoft 365 suite and reportedly mandating its employees put AI to work, the tech giant is reportedly rolling out a new biometric collection setting that can only be turned off three times a year. A Slashdot story yesterday relayed an editor's experience when he noticed that, after uploading a photo from his phone's local storage to Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage, the privacy and permissions page noted an opt-out \"people section\" feature wherein \"OneDrive uses AI to recognize faces in your photos to help you find photos of friends and family.\" When he went to turn it off, a disclaimer stated: \"You can only turn off this setting three times a year.\" It doesn't sound great, but users are speculating about what might motivate the restriction. Commenter on the Slashdot article AmiMoJo replied, \"There might be a more benign reason for it. In GDPR countries, if you turn it off they will probably need to delete all the biometric data … if people toggle it too often, it's…",

So far, that amounts to just two snippets of footage, offering a combined glimpse of less than five minutes into life in Leonida and our long-awaited return to Vice City. As we edge closer to the May 26, 2026 launch date, excitement for a third trailer is growing, but with a far from orthodox road to release thus far—one that's included leaks, court cases and \"indefinite\" secure hospital sentences , to name but some of its twists and turns—is a third pre-launch outing a given at all? Your guess, quite frankly, is as good as ours. Which is exactly why we sought insights from some members of the Grand Theft Auto community on whether or not we can expect a third trailer, and, assuming we do get one, what shape it might take. \"Rockstar is known to keep us on our toes during the run-up to a new game launch—you never really know what you're going to get or when,\" posits staff member, admin, and moderator within the popular and longstanding fansite GTANet.com, GTAKid. \"A new trailer wo…",

So, when Bramble: The Mountain King, an action adventure horror game inspired by Nordic folklore, was released in 2023 it's no surprise that my entire personality became based around this game for a good few months after playing. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. But as much as I adored the world Bramble: The Mountain King built, alongside the beasts both big and small that inhabited it, my obsession with the game wasn't just restricted to playing it. It didn't take long, but its soundtrack became my go-to for things like working, commuting, or whenever I wasn't sure what to put on. You might be sitting there wondering how the soundtrack of a horror game could become such a consistent fallback for me. After all, aren't they designed to induce fear? The answer is a mix of b…",

Duke Nukem: Horror Castle takes the bubblegum-starved FPS titan and plonks him into an all-new episode, swapping out the original's sci-fi shenanigans for a spookier theme. Created by modder WilliamGee, Horror Castle is a sizeable affair. Its nine-level campaign sees Duke explore not one but several gothic fortresses, offering between 3-5 hours of additional FPS fun. It isn't just a level pack either. Horror Castle introduces 24 new enemies including wandering skeletons, vampire bats, and Nosferatu-like bloodsuckers, as well as four minibosses from D3D with the added bonus of being able to shrink them and stomp them to death. Horror Castle also equips Duke with four additional weapons. Duke can toss enormous spiders to attack enemies, then blast them with skeletal shrapnel using the Bone Crusher, a weapon reminiscent of the Ravager from Doom: The Dark Ages . And rather than replenishing health using medkits, Duke can boost his vitality by cracking open discarded skulls and feasting on the soft and squishy sponge w…",

First up is a Halloween-themed \"seasonal mini-event\" called Horrors of Kairos that will run from October 23 to November 6, adding \"blood rain\" to world bosses, new legendary loot, and a pumpkin-head cosmetic for everyone available via Shift code . While that'll be a free addition, a paid add-on will follow with the first Bounty Pack: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day. Like the Headhunter Packs from Borderlands 2, the Bounty Packs will be small additions, with a chain of missions and a boss fight as well as a bunch of themed cosmetics and legendary gear. The story of this one has Rush, the buff lad who runs the Outlanders, trying to keep holiday traditions alive despite the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture, Screw, explicitly restricting seasonal jolliness and cheer. That'll be out on November 20. In December, a free update will add a new difficulty level for Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and an endgame challenge boss, harking back to Crawmerax the Invincible, the raid boss from the first game's Secret Armory of …",
