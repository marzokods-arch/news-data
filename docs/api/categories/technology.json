Alas, Armored Core: Mobile 3 is not likely an instalment the masses will embrace. It was originally released for flip phones in 2007, and further complicating matters, it was a Japanese exclusive. While that's not exactly the case now—you can easily go and buy Armored Core: Mobile 3 on Steam right now—few will have the patience to play it without English subs. Indeed, no major efforts have been made to modernize this ancient artefact, though it does appear to have controller support. Here's the trailer: If that's not enough to discourage you, it's pretty cool to have this curio made available again. It takes place between Armored Core Nexus and Armored Core Last Raven, both of which were offshoots of Armored Core 3.

A reviewer by the name of Bad Wolf kicked off the bit about a month ago, saying that while \"everything is great\" about the hotel, \"the only issue is that players sometimes spawn just 10 meters away from me.\" In the weeks since, all but one review—left by guests who enjoyed a \"ski-related stay\"—have been Arc Raiders references, ranging from the simple \"Hey, Raider!

It's real pretty, but Starhelm is also making some exciting promises on the gameplay front: Shadowglass is planned to be an immersive sim drawing on the stealth game GOAT, Thief: The Dark Project.

Part of the problem, very likely, is that the Asus RTX 5080 Prime in question has a very, very similar 2.5-slot, triple-fan design as the equivalent RTX 5060 Ti Prime model. So, at a glance, they look essentially the same—heck, this Asus AMD Radeon 9070 XT Prime looks very similar, too . Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.
