    "body": "TL;DR A newly discovered type of malware uses machine learning to automatically interact with ads and commit fraud. It can also be used to grant hackers access to your screen. The malware is found on certain games distributed through inappropriate app stores, but some have also been found in Xiaomi’s GetApps app store. AI is designed to make our lives easier, but it’s also adept at making them more difficult. AI-powered tools are becoming increasingly popular among hackers , who can now launch sophisticated attacks that stray from established patterns. One such malware has been detected in a few Android games, and it can be used to commit fraud or attack others through your device. Researchers at Dr. Web (via Bleeping Computer ) have identified a class of trojanware that uses AI to click on ads. According to the researchers, the so-called “clickjacking” malware uses Google’s open-source TensorFlow.js library to run machine learning models to interact with ads inside certain apps or games. Ads are common in free-to-play casual Android games, and some developers may resort to using trojanware to artificially inflate click-through rates, thereby increasing the revenue they generate f…",

The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Samsung has also shared a statement with Android Authority, stating that its analysis concluded that external force was the cause of the incident. Update: January 23, 2025 (1:36 AM ET): Samsung has now shared an amended statement with us, attributing the incident to “external force.” Since the fire department’s investigation concluded that a thermal runaway event occurred, and per the user’s testimony, the phone was simply charging when the incident occurred, it’s unclear what the company means by referring to external force as the cause of the incident. Here’s the full, amended statement Samsung shared with us:",

Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud.

    "body": "Credit: AYANEO TL;DR The KONKR FIT is an upcoming Windows handheld from the prolific handheld maker AYANEO. It packs a Ryzen AI 9 HX 470, 80Wh battery, and a 7-inch OLED screen into a surprisingly compact device. AYANEO showed off a prototype, but there’s no word yet on pricing or availability. Despite announcing that it would slow down to focus on shipping existing products , AYANEO showcased two new gaming handhelds this week. Both were first announced late last year, but this is the first time we got a look at the pint-sized Pocket S Mini , as well as a powerful new Windows handheld with a surprising new chipset. The KONKR FIT is the second handheld from AYANEO’s new sub-brand KONKR, after the Android-based Pocket FIT . Despite the similarities in name and overall design, the new x86 Windows handheld doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to specs.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android appears to be working on a new Transit mode, but details have proven elusive. New text strings have started to reveal what to expect from Transit mode, including a training period while it learns your schedule. Transit mode will be able to automatically adjust Bluetooth and audio settings. Our devices are pretty smart about figuring out what we’re up to, whether that’s our smartwatch detecting when we’re on a bike ride, or our phone recognizing when we’re driving a car. Late last year, we caught wind of another new tool Google appeared to be developing along these lines, identifying early work on a new system for figuring out when you’re riding public transit . As we wait for Google to finish up and introduce it, we’ve got some new updates on what users can expect.
