The sub was simply surfacing to comply with maritime transit rules governing the English Channel, the Kremlin said—Russia being, of course, a noted follower of international law. But social media accounts historically linked to Russian security forces suggested a far more serious problem on the submarine Novorossiysk . According to The Maritime Executive , \"Rumors began to circulate on well-informed social media channels that the Novorossiysk had suffered a fuel leak. They suggested the vessel lacked onboard capabilities and was forced to surface to empty flooded compartments. Some reports said it was a dangerous fuel leak aboard the vessel, which was commissioned in 2012.\" France 24 quoted further social media reports as saying, \"The submarine has neither the spare parts nor the qualified specialists onboard to fix the malfunction,\" and it \"now poses an explosion hazard.\" Read full article Comments",

DirecTV’s Gemini Air is an Android TV-powered USB device that people can plug into a TV for access to live TV channels, as well as streaming apps. Gemini Air doesn’t require a DirecTV satellite connection, and DirecTV gives all of its Internet customers the device. DirecTV first started selling Gemini devices in 2023 , when it launched a separate Gemini set-top box that connects through DirecTV satellite setups. DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices' screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default. When the new screensavers launch, Glance's AI content will show if the TV is idle for 10 minutes, The Verge reported. Read full article Comments",

As promised, the Trump administration and its congressional Republican allies killed off as many of the clean energy and EV incentives as they could after taking power in January. Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit. Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, according to its 8-K . Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.

    "body": "Today is the official end-of-support date for Microsoft's Windows 10. That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support. This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with stricter system requirements that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), according to StatCounter data . But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this here —while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free.

    "body": "SpaceX closed a troubled but instructive chapter in its Starship rocket program Monday with a near-perfect test flight that carried the stainless steel spacecraft halfway around the world from South Texas to the Indian Ocean. The rocket's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life at 6:23 pm CDT (7:23 pm EDT; 23:23 UTC), throttling up to generate some 16.7 million pounds of thrust, by large measure more powerful than any rocket before Starship. Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border. From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date. The only flight with a similar claim occurred one year ago Monday, when the company caught the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad after soaring to the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere. But that flight didn't accomplish as much in space. Read full article Comments",

The Netflix rival that has brought us critically acclaimed shows and movies like Slow Horses and The Lost Bus has gone from Apple TV+ to Apple TV. Apple announced the name change today in a press release that was primarily about the film F1: The Movie coming to its streaming service on December 12. Unlike previous announcements, however, today’s release referred to the streaming service as Apple TV, instead of Apple TV+. The announcement reads: Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity. Apple didn’t specify how its streaming service’s “identity” has changed at all. As of this writing, accessing Apple’s streaming service via a browser or smart TV app still shows the original Apple TV+ branding. Read full article Comments",

The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that less than half of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only 18 percent of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections.
