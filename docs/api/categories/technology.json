Pleasingly then, one tech tinkerer has pushed Windows 7 to its Lilliputian limits. X user @XenoPanther shared a 69 MB version of Windows 7 x86 that just about boots (via The Register ). Created more just to see if they could rather than as an actually usable OS, @XenoPanther writes , \"Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.\" The punchline, though? The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org . It's only the latest in a long line of unofficial attempts to shrink Windows. Last year, we saw another software tinkerer shrink Windows 11 down to only 100 MB by making it throwback to its DOS era.

Which sounds like it'd be pretty tough, given his story is pretty well wrapped-up in 2077 and his actual mortal body has already been dead for decades by that game's start. Or so you might think. But that, and no other reason, is why you aren't Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith. In a recent stream (via GamesRadar ), Pondsmith sounded just as eager as Reeves to get the Hollywood star back into Silverhand's big boots. \"You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,\" said Pondsmith. \"I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.\" What ways? Well, canny old Pondsmith doesn't say. I don't think it's hard to figure out a few plausible theories, though.

Yet, within days of release, 55% of its Steam reviews are negative . \"Input lag is unacceptably high in every game—even offline\" says one, with some players complaining it's even noticeable in the menus. Others are upset that \"the online's in a terrible state. Quick play matches with random people only. You can't queue for more than one game at a time, so the community's splintered between games.\" Another laments, \"The 360/PS3 MK Kollection that came out over 10+ years ago had better netcode than this\".

Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\".

Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. The biggest multiplayer shooters of the moment cost money. Arc Raiders is $40, has no free trial, and it's a top seller. Battlefield 6 launched for $70 and instantly became the most successful game in the series (later adding a free-to-play battle royale mode). Both are raking it in, both are reviewing well, and both are being played more than several of the sturdiest free-to-play shooters on Steam. The numbers won't always look like that, but the wild successes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders prove an important point: people want to pay for great multiplayer shooters again. That's music to my ears, because it didn't always look like we'd get back to this point. Not long ago, it wasn't unreasonable to believe the future of all multiplayer gaming was free-to-play. Under the umbrella of Fortnite's ascension in 2018, new battle royales started cropping up for free, and they were instantly popular. Meanwhile, traditional shooters that d…",

By watching your favorite streamer play Arc Raiders (or by leaving a random stream playing in the bottom right-hand corner of your second monitor while you go about your day) you can unlock several small, free cosmetics. And that's not Arc Raiders' only promotion: there's also a Discord Quest waiting for you in your chat app. For both you'll have to link your Embark account with those services to claim the rewards. I'll quickly run through how to do that and what you can get from Twitch and Discord in Arc Raiders during the launch period. Connect Discord and Twitch to your Embark ID You'll likely have already linked your Steam, Epic or Xbox account to the Embark ID that Arc Raiders prompts you to create when you first start the game.

In November the North Line update will bring the first beefy patch that'll make more substantial changes to the state of play. North Line's biggest addition will be the Stella Montis map, adding a new region of the Rust Belt that's currently, tantalizingly locked on the in-game world map. And to ensure we don't have too good of a time exploring the new area, the November update will also bring new Arc enemies: the Matriarch and the Shredder. I'm sure they're lovely.

While the patent application in question, JP 2024-031879 , isn't directly relevant to the Palworld lawsuit, it's related to patents that are: It's the child application of one of the patents asserted in Nintendo's accusations and is itself the parent application of another. The rejection, therefore, could give Pocketpair a rhetorical opportunity to encourage a similar investigation of the patents it's accused of infringing.

Well, luckily, Corsair has announced a new professional-looking fighter stick, and I can't wait to lose at my local tournament with it. The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board. Keys can be set from anywhere to 0.1mm to 4mm, which means you can make surrounding keys a little harder to press and important ones easier to hit. Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often. Being wireless, it can be connected via Bluetooth, or connected to your rig in 2.4 GHz mode, offering lower latency th…",

Over the years, I've seen the scepticism from comments on my articles and reviews, various online discussion boards, and even friends and colleagues. So I'm here to defend what is, in my perhaps not-so-humble opinion, one of the best upgrades you can make if you're into shooters, which is using a lightweight wireless gaming mouse. I know a lot of gamers will read this and think duh , but this isn't for them; it's for those who are still clinging on to the familiar, like I was for so long. And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless. Switching to a lightweight wireless gaming mouse has probably given me the biggest upgrade to my gaming experience I've had since I jumped from a 60 Hz to a 144 Hz monitor back in the day.
