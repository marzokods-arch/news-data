The endgame loop in Path of Exile 2 basically involves running maps and defeating bosses. Each map can have additional difficulty modifiers crafted onto it to increase the potential rewards. Some of those mods can be brutal, like bonus health to all monsters or full immunity to certain types of elemental damage. The point of the system is to pick and choose which mods your character can handle. But it also means you can create maps that are so nasty that even the best players can't survive.

Horror Castle also equips Duke with four additional weapons. Duke can toss enormous spiders to attack enemies, then blast them with skeletal shrapnel using the Bone Crusher, a weapon reminiscent of the Ravager from Doom: The Dark Ages .

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a good card game, and developers seem to agree with me. Not only have deckbuilders become one of the most popular genres today, but cards seem to sneak their way into everything now. Whether you're drafting football players, choosing abilities in an RPG, or setting your loadout in the latest multiplayer shooter, chances are good that you're looking at a set of cards. What magic there is inside little rectangles of digital cardboard I don't know, but studios seem to find them irresistible. But do you know what I find irresistible? Turning everything into quizzes! So here we are, with a test of how well you remember your videogame cards. With just one draw each, you'll need to tell us the game's title—and see if you can get all 20 right in just five minutes. It might seem easy at first, but beware—there are some very rare pulls in there Let us know how you did in the comments!",

    "body": "For a very brief period before becoming PC Gamer's weekend newshound, I wrote a newsletter dedicated to rounding up the best Steam demos of any given week. By far and away the best demo I played during those days was for a little game called Sektori . If you haven't heard of Sektori, it's a geometric shoot 'em up in the vein of Housemarque's Resogun and Nex Machina , before they became all about ultra-hard third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros . There's good reason for the similarity. Sektori's creator, Kimmo Lahtinen, worked at Housemarque for 13 years, before departing to pursue his own projects, like a hack 'n' slash game called Barbarian, and a match-3 life sim called Day Repeat Day. Neither of these games made much impact, and I don't know whether they deserved to or not. But I believe Sektori does. Housemarque's lineage oozes from every glowing, spinning polygon. You control a little 3D arrow (known in-game as a 'ship') blasting shapes as they spawn all around a top-down arena. If you get touched by any shape or projectile, the game is instantly over. It sounds almost stupidly simple, but when I jumped into the demo this time last year it revealed its ge…",

But as we watch it slowly ascend to the great operating system repository in the sky, I've been thinking about its legacy. And really, I think the best thing you can say about Windows 10 (among many potential candidates) is that it righted a lot of the wrongs of Windows 8, and for that it should be celebrated. It's easy to forget what a misstep Windows 8 was. Built primarily around the principle that an OS interface should be a hybrid between a touchscreen system and regular ol' mouse and keyboard, it managed to somehow fail at both, resulting in a frustrating experience for desktop users and a halfway house for those trying to make use of its flat, coloured-tile, touchscreen-friendly interface.

As spotted by Gematsu (via PCGamesN ) a listing for Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 briefly appeared on the website for the ESRB—the US' entertainment ratings body. The page, which has since been taken down, awarded Fireteam Elite 2 a \"Mature\" rating for \"Blood and Gore, Strong Language and Violence\" (sounds like an Aliens game!). The page also mentioned the sequel was being published by Daybreak Games Company (as opposed to Focus Entertainment, the original game's publisher) and that it's coming to PC as well as PS5 and Xboxes large and small. Since games only tend to get rated close to release, this would suggest that a surprise launch for Fireteam Elite 2 is imminent. Of course, the rating could be some weird mistake, but the info that was displayed on the page tracks with rumours surrounding a possible sequel, as well as statements previously made by both Cold Iron and Daybreak.

In a roundabout way, this was recently demonstrated by modder, YouTuber, and mapper Goonya's Animations , who took a map he was making for Half-Life 2 and somehow made it run in Half-Life 1's GoldSrc engine with minimal visual difference. In a video titled \"This is GoldSrc\", Goonya showed off the map in action. The video starts with a run-through of the Half-Life 2 version of the map, which is midway through development. Its handful of corridors includes a room filled with computer terminals and faux-digital displays, and tiled floors with fetching phong-shaded reflections.

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later. Remedy fired out some quick patches and committed to more significant changes, the first of which went live near the end of September .

But in case you've wondered about some of the broader design choices that went into the last couple of generations plus the upcoming one, Intel's just answered why these CPU cores are the way they are. Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores—a mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones—for the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips—the first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature—ditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that…",
