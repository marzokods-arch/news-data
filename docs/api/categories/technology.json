    "body": "TL;DR Samsung is one of five TV manufacturers accused of illegally collecting automated content recognition (ACR) data from TVs in the state of Texas. A new temporary restraining order bars Samsung from collecting ACR data within the state. A hearing to potentially impose a temporary injunction against Samsung is scheduled for January 9. Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit against five TV manufacturers for “spying on Texans” through the use of automated content recognition (ACR). In the suits, Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense, and TCL are all accused of surreptitiously harvesting screenshots of users’ TV content for the purpose of targeted advertising. This week, Paxton’s office announced a new development: a judge in Texas has issued a temporary restraining order against Samsung, stopping the practice within the state. As spotted by SamMobile , the new restraining order signed by State District Judge Benjamin Smith calls for Samsung and anyone working with the company to halt any collection, sharing, or use of ACR data related to users in Texas, citing violations of the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act . A hearing on the case has been scheduled this Friday, Ja…",

Android phones have long offered 200MP cameras, with Motorola, Xiaomi, and Samsung initially leading the charge. We’ve since seen 200MP sensors used on Android phones by OPPO, realme, HONOR, and vivo. What about Apple, though? Well, it sounds like we’re in for a long wait. According to an investor note by Morgan Stanley (spotted via AppleInsider ), Apple will only adopt 200MP cameras on the iPhone 21 series in 2028.

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR At CES 2026, Razer revealed Project Motoko, an AI-powered headphone concept with built-in cameras that can answer questions and understand its surroundings via voice commands. Razer is pitching headphones as a new way to control AI, offering environmental awareness and support for major AI platforms, though it remains a concept with no product plans confirmed. Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair . This year, the company has something equally innovative to share in the form of Project Motoko. At first glance, you’d assume that these were simply a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but underneath you’ll find an incredible amount of AI-powered smarts.

Every company is indeed cramming AI into as many devices and form factors as possible, so I’d forgive you if your knee-jerk reaction is to write off Razer’s AI headphones (known as Project Motoko) as just more AI nonsense. But having seen Project Motoko in action, Razer’s actually created something really interesting and worthwhile.",
