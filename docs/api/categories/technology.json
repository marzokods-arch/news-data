There are several guards and deceptively precise jumps standing between you and freedom. The real reward for completing The Slab is getting out with your stuff back, but there's a Lost Flea to rescue, a Spool Fragment , and some Rosaries to collect there too. Most people will probably find The Slab by getting kidnapped in Act 1, but it's possible to get there in Act 2 without losing your stuff. Being a completionist, I intentionally got myself locked up early on to see what the fuss was about, so the advice below is written from that perspective. It won't be as harrowing if you decide to wait until Act 2 though because you can leave at any time. How to find The Slab in Silksong (Image credit: Tyler C. / Team Cherry) The Slab is a somewhat hidden area no matter when you decide to enter it. In Act 1, you can find an armored flea enemy with a cage on the right side of the Deep Docks area. Alternatively, you can find one in Greymoor if you've progressed the The Lost Fleas quest far enough for the caravan to move a second time. The arm‚Ä¶",

Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pok√©mon.

Notably though, like other machines we've seen of this ilk, the announcement is all specs and no price or availability. CTEE.com spotted this mini AI workstation from Acer during the company's presentation last week. Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further. Apparently they've packed 128 GB of unified memory, as well as up to 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage into this box that looks about twice the of Mac Mini. Acer boasts that the configuration adds up to deliver up to 1 petaflop of powerful AI compute performance. This is on par with Nvidia's own mini AI PC powerhouse, the DGX Spark.

    "body": "Chipmaking is an incredibly complex process that only gets more so to meet the needs of smaller, more intricate chips. It requires lithography machines to print and scale these silicon thinking machines. High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet , or High NA EUV, lithography tools are among some of the newest and most cutting-edge methods of making chips. These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made. This new system boasts the ability to print transistors 1.7 times smaller than previous High NA EUV machines. It also delivers 2.9 times the existing transistor densities, providing what SK hynix says is a 40% improvement in the NA ‚Ä¶",

This Wednesday the game will get its first major update: The Lost Arsenal , a free, 15-card set of new equipment and rooms. Shiny Shoe shared with PC Gamer exclusively four of the cards appearing in the update, and provided commentary on each of them. Some significant balance changes to existing cards are on the way too, outlined in this post on Steam . I asked the devs some questions about the looming update, as well as what can be learned from Monster Train 2's player data now three months after release. The new cards The Great Decay (Image credit: Shiny Shoe) PC Gamer: This card seems tailor made for Morel Mistress. Are there any other combos that you had in mind while making it?
