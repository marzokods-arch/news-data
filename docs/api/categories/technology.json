Void Interactive very quickly complied: Kaminsky was removed from the Discord server and their presence largely scrubbed from Void Interactive's website , and just ahead of the weekend the studio posted a message on Steam saying Kaminsky was gone. \"We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,\" Void Interactive wrote. \"These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. \"We have ended our …",

I'm not sure when we started calling these things \"server slams\" rather than playtests, but the term is certainly evocative in reflecting the goal: Ensuring, as much as such a thing is possible, that the servers for a popular online game won't collapse under the weight of the launch-day rush of players.

    "body": "Turns out, for just $30, you can get a sage green vape with a built-in 1100 mAh battery, USB Type-C charging, and a 1.47-inch TFT touchscreen. Throw away the E-Liquid, though, we won't be needing it to slay imps, demons, and lost souls. Hacker and creator Aaron Christophel recently took to their YouTube channel to show Doom on a Pixo Aspire, which is \"a way overpowered vape, for whatever reason\" ( via VideoCardz ). It has a 32-bit Arm Cortex M4 processor, 384 kB of flash memory and up to 64 kB of SRAM. Christophel notes that it would need \"that last bit of RAM\" to run Doom natively, so this version is effectively sending game output to a bit of software, which flips the screen to run on the vape. In other words, a PC runs Doom but displays it on the vape's touchscreen via a USB Type-C cable. Christophel says you can \"use it as a second monitor\", which makes sense, should you have to show a mouse or some sort of small pet a duplicate of your screen. Hey, it's nice to have the option. If you have such a mouse, you can grab custom firmware via GitHub , run it on the vape, then mirror your screen. Impressively, this little vape has a Bluetooth LE chip and a microphone, too.

And when I say tad , I actually mean a hugely complicated feat of highly-skilled engineering, as one modder amply demonstrates. Apple's latest iPhone 17 Pro Max , the most expensive one in the released launched lineup, is available with four storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB. There's a $200 price tag difference between the first three, and because of the size of the capacity jump, a $400 gap between the 1 and 2 TB models. Unfortunately, there's no SD card slot or the like, so you can't change how much storage you have once you've bought one. Well, actually you can , though as DirectorFeng on YouTube shows, it's really not straightforward at all. With immaculate presentation and attention to detail, DirectorFeng's lengthy-but-lovely video takes you through every step involved in replacing the 256 GB SSD module in an iPhone 17 Pro Max with a 1 TB one (they had planned to use a 2 TB module but couldn't…",

The first is from The Korea Economic Daily (via Bloomberg ), which claims that Samsung's HBM3E RAM chips have finally passed Nvidia's qualification tests for use in its AI mega-processors. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of RAM where multiple memory dies are stacked together to create a single module that can sustain a huge amount of data traffic per second. Samsung's most recent version of this tech, HBM3E , hadn't been meeting expectations , leaving competitor SK Hynix as the sole provider of the special memory for Nvidia. That no longer seems to be the case, though, given that its HBM3E has only just been approved, it will be some while before order books are full to bursting. Still, it's good news as far as the stock market is concerned, as Bloomberg points out that current prices are roughly 20% higher than expectations. What's certainly helping here i…",

Granted, it also tends to create a lot of bugs and dead ends in the process. But when Shadows of Doubt works, it's one of the best games ever made. Yet the latest update somehow makes Shadows of Doubt even more conceptually appealing, by letting you play as a detective who is also a rat. The modifiers update injects a bunch of optional mutations into the sim's algorithmic genes, one of which lets you prowl its rain-slicked alleys as a trenchcoat-wearing rodent. Simply titled \"rat detective\", the modifier shrinks your character down to a mere 10cm tall, letting you experience the powers and perils of being a city-dwelling rodent. The advantage of being a rat detective is you can climb on walls and ceilings, and sneak past people more easily. The downside is that you can't question people, and citizens may even be hostile to your presence. I gave the rat detective …",
