By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output .

Problem is, these expansions are big, and MMO players are kind of like water: They'll find the cracks. Sure as the tide comes in and goes out, players soon found that they could rinse through certain elite farms, as well as gathering nodes, and ramp their Infinite Power up into the millions. Blizzard's stepped in to sort this out, per a post to the Legion Remix forums : \"Due to an oversight in our loot table setup, some activities—particularly elite farming, herb gathering, and mining—were unintentionally yielding far more Infinit…",

The OpenAI boss says a new version of ChatGPT \"that behaves more like what people liked about 4o\" is coming in a few weeks, and it'll get even better—or potentially much worse, depending on how you feeling about the idea—in December with the introduction of AI-powered \"erotica.\" \"We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,\" Altman wrote on X . \"We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right. Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.\" It's arguable that OpenAI has been anything but “careful” with the mental health impacts of its chatbots. The company was sued in August by the parents of a teenager who died of suicide after allegedly being encouraged and instructed on how to do so by ChatGPT. The following month, Altman said the software would be trained …",

According to Steam's charts , what's getting the most attention in the current Next Fest is an old tech demo for Half Sword. But really, can you blame anyone? Videogames are nothing if not proof of a near-universal fascination with the idea of people hitting each other with objects, and Half Sword's physics-based simulation of 15th century martial combat takes that grisly spectacle to a bloody, often clumsy extreme. (Image credit: Half Sword Games) Created in consultation with practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts, Half Sword aims for authentic representation of historical weaponry, armor, and techniques from historical combat manuals. And the results of when those hits land are simulated with similar realism, as evidenced by Half Sword's regular dismemberments and disembowelings. In my case, a few of those dismemberments have been self-inflicted. Turns out your sword doesn't get any less sharp if you have a rough landing while your physics-enabled limbs get tangled with your …",

It looks like it could be killer, especially for handheld gaming PCs. But is the Xe3 iGPU in Panther Lake based on its much-discussed next-gen Celestial graphics tech? A mild tweak of Battlemage? Or something else entirely? In an interview with PC World , Intel's long-suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has tried to clear things up. But we've come away if anything more confused. And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage. Another oddity is that while the slide refers to both Xe2 and Battlemage, it only calls out Xe3 and not the \"Celestial\" generational codename that has previously been attached to Xe3. To make things even more baffling, Intel also b…",
