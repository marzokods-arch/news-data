Microsoft seems to be shoving the gaming platform onto all manner of things... handhelds, the cloud, Windows PCs... and now even cars, of all things. Not any and every car, though, just \"select internet-connected vehicles\" with some LG smart TVs in them. Xbox says : \"With the Xbox built into LG’s webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) , passengers in internet-connected vehicles will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app.\" ACP is part of PlayWare, a \"suite of in-cabin entertainment solutions\" that will now apparently include Xbox game streaming. So, if you're lucky enough to have a vehicle with smart TVs hooked up on the backs of seats and whatnot, then— passengers only! —you'll be able to play Xbox Game Pass games. You might even be able to stream non-Game Pass console games that you own , if you're a Game Pass Ultimate member and Xbox Insider on the PC Gaming Preview, assuming that July update applies here. Don't hold me to that, though, it's not terribly clear. What is clear is that Microsoft is keen on pushing its Xbox services as a whole multi-platform package, including streaming.

Something it seemingly won't be snagging anytime soon, however, is a Helldivers 2 collaboration despite Fortnite's newest season leaning very heavily into that game's whole shtick. That's according to Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani. As spotted by VideoGamer , someone in the Helldivers 2 Discord asked Jorjani if we could ever expect to see the studio's elite soldiers squashing bugs in the likes of Swarmy Stash or Canyon Crossing anytime soon. \"Not a priority,\" he wrote in response. It doesn't seem like Jorjani is totally willing to close that door altogether, though. \"But who knows one day. [Fortnite] is cool. And quite big.\" A rather succinct response, but not wrong. Fortnite is certainly both cool and big. And as much as I tire of the endless collaborations and how it's led to the Fortification of just about every damn videogame these days, I can only assume they're often mutually beneficial arrangements for both Epic and whichever piece of media it's working with.

Fonseca explains how he \"built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.\" The villagers are central to the game and their dialogue is what makes it so special, so how does AI add anything to the already charming world? From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",

And could it really fool me into believing I was playing my games locally, as opposed to streaming through a home broadband connection? To find out, I've been granted early access to the new top-tier GeForce Now subscription—and I've been directly comparing it to the experience of using one of our Cyberpower benchmarking PCs.

This happened once before when I got really hyperfocused on learning an Elphelt combo in Guilty Gear: Strive. The things we do for dopamine. Anyway, I've prescribed myself one \"play a game that doesn't hurt your hands\", and I've landed on Letters to Arralla —an adorable upcoming game by Little Pink Clouds where you play a turnip with a fat ass. Also, you have mail to deliver. I technically should've led with that, the butt is entirely secondary. From what I've played of the demo, Letters is a delightful little puzzle-exploration sim with a Stardew-esque roster of freaky veggie friends to deliver letters to. Unlike in the real world, where opening someone else's mail is a very serious crime, it's encouraged on Arralla—because it'll give you insight into all your little veggie friends. Plus they don't seem to mind. It's part of the culture, I guess, even if I did feel bad for peeling off all their mates' cute little stickers.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

What they found was a drop when moving over to the new Samsung memory, and gamers were quick to condemn the change. Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption.

More importantly, they don't oscillate between outdated memes and unsuccessful melodrama—they just grab a solid pitch and run with it.
