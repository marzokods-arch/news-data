    "body": "The first trailer for season 4 of The Witcher on Netflix is here, showcasing the new Geralt, his new team, and most importantly of all, a debut date of October 30. We haven't previously known the release date for the fourth season of Netflix's best-known monster-killing show, so that's probably the real headline news here. For me, though, the real eye-catcher is Laurence Fishburne's big hair. That is a look. (Image credit: Netflix) Fishburne is playing Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy—just Regis to his friends—in Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher, a higher vampire who joins Geralt and company on their quest to track down Ciri. Regis also played a pivotal role in The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion, and to be fair he had a pretty wild 'do in that one too. (Image credit: CD Projekt) We also get a very brief glimpse at what I'm pretty sure is Danny Woodburn as Zoltan Chivay, another of Geralt's stalwart companions. Also some undeniably phenomenal hair going on there. (Image credit: Netflix) The rest of the gang is here, and there's plenty of violence to enjoy, being dished out not just by Geralt but also Yennefer and Ciri, both of whom have become very handy in a fight.

Since then, nothing about the recent Ash & Iron update has persuaded me to return. And it's not just me: Bungie's recent moves have done nothing to stop players from leaving, at least if Steam's data is considered representative of the playerbase at large. Yesterday, Destiny 2 posted its lowest daily peak concurrent player count in the game's history—16,067 players. That 'beats' the previous low of 18,023 back in the doldrums of Revenant—the last expansion cycle's worst episode. It's worth remembering that peak daily concurrents offer us a very limited picture: The number of players simultaneously in-game during Destiny 2's busiest period. It doesn't tell us how many players actually logged into the game over the course of the day. Nor does it tell us what the game's population is on other platforms. It certainly gestures at something though—a snapshot of data that speaks to a game in decline, whatever the actual number of active players is. For me it seems obvious—both from my own anecdotal experiences and…",

I think the folks at Epictellers are being a little gunshy. What I saw wasn't terrible at all—the environment, a space cantina bar with flickering neon signs, looks pretty and well-detailed.

Great news for you, dear reader, less so me moving around my small, now very cramped, office. While I am a fan of the white HS 420, the black version is the better-looking of the BF 360 options. That's mostly down to the front panel. Both versions come with speckled, textured front panels—the thing that lured me to these cases when they were first displayed on the Computex showfloor—but the lighter panel looks a lot better in contrast to the black shell. The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis. Havn has even handed me a diagram of all the various prototypes it worked through for where it put the supports for these vents and how it landed on the final design for …",

That perception dramatically changed, I reckon, around the time of massively multiplayer Curiosity: What's Inside The Cube . It was a game in which, well, a lot of players all tapped on a cube, removing layer after layer until they eventually hit the centre. Molyneux promised the prize for the single player who reached that centre would be \"life-changing\". It turned out to be the role of 'God of gods' in Molyneux's then-upcoming game Godus, plus 1% of the game's revenue. The winner—an 18-year-old named Bryan Henderson—never got any money, and told Eurogamer that he was largely forgotten by Molyneux's studio after a single visit to its office in 2015.

Arguably the most exciting element of the new chip for PC gaming, however, is the new Xe3-spec iGPU, also known as Celestial. The new \"X\" branded models reportedly get 12 graphics cores.

In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",

The game that seems to worry Activision, though? Going by the chat function in Black Ops 7, it's Arc Raiders (due out on October 30). The words \"Arc Raiders\" are censored in Black Ops 7 chat. PCG's Elie Gould tested it out, and when you try to type those words you just get a load of asterisks. Neither \"Arc\" nor \"Raiders\" is picked up like this, only the two words together. Now, there is one kink worth considering here before we all get the pitchforks out. Several months ago users reported a similar problem in the EA App chat . First of all it's surprising that anyone used chat in the EA App, but the situation here was exactly the same. Once this was noticed EA seemed to move quickly to correct the situation, and players could happily chat about Arc Raiders on the EA App from 6 August. EA obviously has Battlefield 6 launching this Friday, so in both cases these companies have dir…",

    "body": "Intel's woes the last decade or so are well-enough documented. So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

Today, Mala Petaka asks: what if Doom was a gumdrop-sweet game they made in Japan in 1992? Created in actual GZDoom, the open-source Doom engine first forked all the way back in 2005, Mala Petaka is a for-real modern Doom clone that swaps out the hell and heavy metal for a lot of primary colours and some banging chiptunes. I've spent a bit of time mucking about in its demo and, my friends, it works. (Image credit: Hellforge Studios) It's also hard , or maybe I'm just bad at it. Your skull-faced protagonist, Petaka, goes from blemish-free to bloody in record time, and enemies approach you in swarms and hails of gunfire. I died. A lot. To deal with this challenge, Mala Petaka incorporates a few modern-shooter gubbins into its GZDoom framework. Most notable is a pseudo-glory-kill mechanic: whittle enemies down enough and you can eventually deliver a quick rat-a-tat of punches that turn them into a fountain of ammo and health chips. But on top of this we also have status effects, movement tech, and a variety of pickups …",

The game's Steam reviews have been absolutely tanking and the reason will surprise no-one who's played it: performance. I'm a Monster Hunter megafan and, when it released, Wilds ran so poorly for those opening weeks that it pretty much put me off. The crossover update launched on September 29, 2025, and since then there have been just over 5,000 reviews posted, with just under 80% of those negative. The Steam reviews make for some grim reading , and what's especially notable is how many of them begin by talking about the reviewer's love for the Monster Hunter series, with the obvious comparison point of MH: World frequently used. The game's overall reviews are just about treading water at \"Mixed\" but those 5,000 \"mostly negative\" recent reviews are taking a toll. . \"The game is fun but completely overshadowed by the technical issues, which have been here since day one,\" says Sol FamilyGuy. That points to another refrain, which is that players are exasperated that the technical issues in Wilds have persisted for so…",

Exactly how many GPUs AMD will sell to OpenAI isn't clear, but the announcement says that if the arrangement comes fully to fruition, OpenAI will be running fully 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Intriguingly, the deal also includes OpenAI taking an up to 10% equity stake in AMD. The first 1 gigawatt tranche kicks off in the second half of next year based on AMD's next-gen Instinct MI450 AI GPU. At the same time, OpenAI will acquire the first segment of up to 160 million AMD shares. If the deal progresses right through to the final 6 gigawatt GPU power figure, OpenAI will by then have bought 160 million AMD shares accounting for roughly 10% of the company. At current values, that would be a $26 billion investment. So, it's a megabucks deal all round. It also the first really big AI GPU win of this kind for AMD, at least that we are aware of. It looks like it's big news too for the markets, as AMD's share price rocketed up 35% on the news during early trading . Kerching! It's yet another good news item for AMD in stark contrast to Intel's ongoing trials and tribulations . It's also the first time that AMD…",

In a blog posted to the site today, Activision boasted some pretty impressive numbers, at least at first glance. \"Cheaters were expected. But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems, helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn’t last long. Most never made it into a match.\" For context, \"TPM 2.0 checks\" refers to the fact that the new Call of Duty requires secure boot and TPM 2.0 to be played on PC —which isn't unique to the game itself. Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\". It also shuts out people without TPM on their processors (hence the aforementioned Linux upset). The \"automated systems\" are referring to Ricochet, an anti-cheat system that uses AI—if these nu…",
