    "body": "Nintendo-watchers may remember when little-known accessory-maker Genki showed the world an extremely accurate 3D-printed mockup of the Switch 2 back in January, about a week before Nintendo's own \"first look\" teaser video and months before the system's wider unveiling . Now, in a newly filed settlement agreement, Genki has agreed to pay Nintendo unspecified damages for \"trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising\" in connection with that promotional stunt. The controversy started at the Consumer Electronics Show, where Genki showed off to press and attendees the 3D mockup of the then-unseen Switch 2 sporting the company's accessories. Genki also posted a video showing a detailed mockup of the system from various angles. By April, Genki was promoting a \"Genki Direct\" livestream focused on \"upcoming accessories for Genki Glitch 2\" (no that isn't a typo). Nintendo's lawyers reportedly visited Genki's CES booth once reports of the Switch 2 mockup started going viral. But a Genki representative asserted at the time that the company did not sign an NDA with Nintendo and therefore \"has nothing to worry about.\" Read full article Comments",

The final judgement, which was jointly agreed to by both parties, asserts that Daly knowingly sold devices such as the MIG Switch and MIG Dumper that \"are primarily designed for the purpose of circumventing the [technological protection measures, and] have limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent the TPMs.\" Daly also sold and installed mod chips to get around Switch DRM and \"copied and distributed certain copyrighted Nintendo games to his customers,\" according to the judgment. Nintendo's lawsuit alleged that the company initially approached Daly about the sale of these devices in March 2024, and that Daly agreed at the time \"both verbally and in signed writing\" to refrain from further sales. After Daly continued to sell the devices, though, Nintendo took the further step of bringing this lawsuit last June. Read …",

One user with dyslexia said that the tool \"empowered\" them to perform tasks with confidence they previously lacked, particularly in report writing. Another dyslexic participant drew direct comparisons to existing accessibility software, noting that Copilot \"does a hell of a lot more\" than traditional assistive technology while being \"embedded in your applications\" rather than requiring separate programs.

The suit, filed in US District Court for the District of Northern California, recites a litany of purported security and privacy flaws that Meta not only didn’t fix after becoming aware of them, but also kept secret, allegedly in violation of a $5 billion settlement then-Whatsapp parent company Facebook reached with the Federal Trade Commission.

The company lost its adtech antitrust case earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: \"The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline.\" Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case declined to order that in the remedies. Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition.

    "body": "Today, Polestar debuted its newest model. Just as three is followed by four , next in the series comes five—in this case the Polestar 5. And the new EV is a little departure from the products we've seen so far from this Swedish/Chinese startup. It's a handsome if angular sedan that, like the Polestar 4 SUV, eschews a rear window in favor of more headroom for passengers and a rear-view camera. \"Polestar 5 is bringing the future to our present. Our vision for Polestar's design, technology, and sustainability direction is no longer a dream but a reality our customers can buy,\" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"With its pure Scandinavian design inside and out, unique platform, powerful motors, sophisticated chassis, cutting-edge technology, and consciously sustainable materials, the Polestar 5 is a guiding star for the industry and the perfect Polestar flagship.\" As we found out when we met the car early during its development , the Polestar 5 uses a bonded aluminum chassis, similar to various Lotuses and most current Aston Martins. Indeed, plenty of the development engineers working at Polestar's UK R&amp;D center in Coventry can count those brands on their CVs. The bonded alum…",

That’s a progression from the 81 percent of IT work that’s done today without any use of AI, per Mullery. By 2030, not only will all IT work rely on AI, but much of it will be performed by bots without the help of humans, Gartner’s analysts said. They predicted that in five years, 25 percent of IT work will be totally performed by bots, while 75 percent of IT workloads will be performed by humans with the help of AI.

The community was working to get around Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation via a coordinated Virtual Machine . That \"master library\" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity. At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With today's addition of Real Soccer 2009 to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time. All at once, then slowly GitHub user Olsro, the originator of the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project , tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October.

It's the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it's all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today. Rather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car's 400 V traction battery. The system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid, which Ars recently reviewed . For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack.

Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity. After many twists and turns, NASA's 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month.

Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA's spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA's science funding in half. This year's federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have signaled they will reject most of Trump's cuts , it's far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation. Read full article Comments",
