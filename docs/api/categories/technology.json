It looks like it could be killer, especially for handheld gaming PCs. But is the Xe3 iGPU in Panther Lake based on its much-discussed next-gen Celestial graphics tech? A mild tweak of Battlemage? Or something else entirely? In an interview with PC World , Intel's long-suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has tried to clear things up. But we've come away if anything more confused. And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage. Another oddity is that while the slide refers to both Xe2 and Battlemage, it only calls out Xe3 and not the \"Celestial\" generational codename that has previously been attached to Xe3. To make things even more baffling, Intel also b…",

Microsoft says that Copilot app update 1.25095.161 is already beginning to roll out across all Windows Insider channels, and that asking it to \"make my screen easier to read\" or \"help me focus by reducing distractions\" will cause it to guide users to the relevant Windows settings page, complete with a brief summation of how to make the changes they seek.

Anyway, this actually seems like useful functionality for your everyday user, something that Copilot has always had the promise of delivering, but in many cases has come up short.

The biggest issue right now, however, is that it's a Sisyphean task: there's a prevalent bug preventing assignments tracking whatsoever for some players, or not tracking accurately in other cases. Healing 5,000 damage from teammates or getting kills while buffed by a stim is one thing, but when none of it is counted and you're not making any progress at all, it's a frustrating mess.

By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,\" the announcement says. That implies OpenAI wants to at least try to do its own thing with AI hardware rather than be entirely at the mercy of Nvidia and, to a lesser extent, AMD. But arguably the bigger intrigue involves the financial implications of yet another big hardware deal from OpenAI. Lest you have forgotten, in recent weeks OpenAI has announced a $300 billion deal for cloud computing services with Oracle, a complex deal with Nvidia worth at least $100 billion , followed by yet another deal with Nvidia's arch rival, AMD, that's worth at minimum tens of billions of dollars .

Details on the lunge enchantment for the spear have been shared in an official blog post about the update. This enchantment gives you a burst of speed when using the weapon, which you can take advantage of in combat to deliver hits to any mobs that might be challenging to fight with a sword. But, you can also use the enchantment to travel around the overworld a lot faster, which is bound to save your hunger from rapidly depleting if you run around on foot. Other features available to test in this snapshot include the Nautilus, which you will now be able to go and tame and ride around the ocean, alongside the Zombie Nautilus which we now know is tameable.

A team of scientists at Fudan University in Shanghai have published a study detailing their latest achievement, a fully functional memory chip built with integrated 2D materials a few atoms thick. Yesssss. This is the Star Trek-level technology I was promised as a child. Well, maybe that's jumping the gun a bit. Still, the achievement here is incredibly impressive (via Tom's Hardware ). Essentially, the researcher's new Atom2chip process allowed them to flow a layer of molybdenum disulphide , functioning as a memory array, on top of a 0.13 micrometre CMOS silicon chip—fusing together an emerging atomic-scale, \"2D\" technology with traditional methods to create a working hybrid memory chip. The chip-riding 2D flash memory array is able to communicate with the CMOS chip's control logic via a custom interface, which in turn means that instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism and random access instructions can be swapped between the two. And the deeper you go, the more impressive the scale of the achievement becomes. While wafers are polished…",

After over a year of griping about Dawntrail's story , griping about Dawntrail's release schedule , and griping about Forked Tower , I'm finally logging back into Final Fantasy 14 again on a regular basis. More than that, I'm actually having fun. I'm having fun playing an MMORPG, it finally happened! Alright, I'm being snippy—which you can't hold against me because I'm writing this on a Monday—but in all seriousness, it's not like Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail's had nothing to do. Assuming you like raiding. But the ills of the casual/midcore content drought and an over-reliance on one-and-done activities has made the game suffer for some time. Don't take my word for it, listen to director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) , who has outlined a desire to make more variable difficulties after the whole Forked Tower snafu saw only a sliver of the playerbase engaging with it: \"I do feel that Forked Tower: Blood was a misstep in development … we made it too difficult for players to even get into the raid in the first place.\" In other intervie…",

He recently did an interview with the BBC to discuss Borderlands 4, and Gearbox's history more generally, in which he basically humblebrags about what Borderlands gets right, during which I think he claims it basically encapsulates the human experience? \"[Gearbox's] mission is to entertain the world,\" said Pitchford. \"Which means we suck! Because there are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. Borderlands, with 4, we’re gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise.

That's according to the Financial Times , which cites \"two people familiar with the plans\" and says the two new hires, Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, have experience working on world models. Apparently, the creations are intended to help create game environments. That tracks, too, given Musk's previous comments : \"The XAI game studio will release a great AI-generated game before the end of next year.\" If these world models are put towards game world creation, I'm sure we'll have a whole bunch of new AI slop to look forward to. I mean, just look at the aforementioned X post—Musk is responding to a clip of a game that looks absolutely atrocious. I'm sure it will allow for lots of bespoke and custom game scenes, of course.

But what was certain was that a large chunk of the VRMs were now missing, which meant power could no longer reach the chip itself (via Videocardz ). However, YouTuber Paulo Gomes took it upon themselves to see what they could do for the stricken graphics card, and arrived at an unusual solution: wiring in the VRMs still attached to an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card to provide electrical assistance to the fallen RTX 5070 Ti . And holy hell, it appears to have worked. The AMD card was rigged with a series of electrical wires to bypass the missing VRMs, and was left riding piggyback aboard its much-more-powerful competitor. There's something uncomfortably medical about the whole affair, what with the sequence of wires resembling hospital tubes—but lo and behold, the RTX 5070 Ti now provides an output signal once more.
