My favourite way to cut through the chaos of multiplayer shooters or terrifying horror games is to sprinkle in some light-hearted games, whether they be sims or puzzles, I don't care, as long as it resets my adrenaline. I stumbled across Little Woody after playing one too many Arc Raiders matches. With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove. (Image credit: Prism Realm Ltd.) But even if Little Woody's demo may be painfully short, what I played was enough to convince me to wishlist the game and start a countdown for its release.

Essentially, the tech giant is touting it as an extension of its autofill feature, which fills in your address or credit card details into sites asking for the right information. Auto browse, however, can apparently go a lot further. \"Auto browse can help you optimize your vacation planning by doing some of the mundane work, like researching hotel and flight costs across multiple date options, so you can find a budget-friendly time to travel\", says Google. Even as an AI sceptic, I have to admit it's a strong start. As someone who books a lot of flights and hotels, I can confirm that comparing deals is an absolute pain in the... neck.

The chip-integrated fibres are said to be as thin as a human hair, and can withstand repeated bending and abrasion, stretching, twisting, and even \"crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons\". Their results have been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature , and the potential uses for such a thin, bendable, and resilient tech are legion (via SCMP ). Beyond the possibility of creating fabrics where every fibre is its own miniature system, the scientists say that the tech could also be leveraged into brain-computer interfaces. The study into the fabric-like tech was led by Professor Huisheng Peng at Fudan University. The researchers built circuits onto an elastic substrate, before rolling it into a thin, resilient fibre which can function as a complete microcomputer system. \"FICs can process both digital and analogue signals similar to commercial arithmetic chips and perform neural computing with high recognition accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art in-memory image process…",

Its biggest problem, as PC Gamer's Toreador-in-the-streets, Venture-in-the-sheets Joshua Wolens so accurately put it, is the title : Calling it Bloodlines 2, rather than anything else that would safely distance it from the legendary original, was a massive self-inflicted kneecapping. That's not to say there aren't legitimate complaints to be made about the game, because there absolutely are, but there's no doubt in my mind that Bloodlines 2 would've been received far more warmly if it hadn't hitched its wagon to a game people just refuse to be normal about. Anyway, now I've got that off my chest, this is what we're actually here for: Paradox and The Chinese Room have rolled out the Bloodlines 2 roadmap for 2026 , laying out what's coming over the course of the next year. If your immediate reaction to this news is, \"Bloodlines 2 has a roadmap?\" the answer is yes it does: Paradox may not have been super-happy with how Bloodlines 2 sold , but it's sticking with the game to the very end. You might recall that Paradox has said this previously (when it talked about not being super-happy with how Bloodline…",

In return for donating robot parts, you'll get blueprints, rare weapons, an emote, and, yes, even a guitar. So, if you want a display to showcase your mastery over Arc Raiders' machines, you'll need to complete all five stages of the Trophy Display project. I'll go over everything you need to gather below. All Arc Raiders Trophy Display steps Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) As mentioned, the Trophy Display project has five steps that you'll need to progress through.

One of the ideas it was batting about? Checking out this whole Linux thing, since quite a few people seem to be jumping ship from Windows recently. But beyond expressing a general interest, the pair weren't willing to make any concrete commitments to Linux as a platform. Well, I guess the intervening few weeks made some difference: in a recent job posting for a senior software engineer for GOG Galaxy (GOG's optional Steam-like game interface), it straightforwardly says \"Linux is the next major frontier\" for the client. \"We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG Galaxy's architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one,\" reads the posting. \"At the same time, GOG Galaxy is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.\" In other words: you have to be able to get everything hunky-dory on Linux without breaking the entire thing for GOG Galaxy's pre-existing macOS and Windows user base.
