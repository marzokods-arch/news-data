    "body": "As many of us are ramping up with shopping, baking, and planning for the holiday season, nuclear power plants are also getting ready for one of their busiest seasons of the year. Here in the US, nuclear reactors follow predictable seasonal trends. Summer and winter tend to see the highest electricity demand, so plant operators schedule maintenance and refueling for other parts of the year. This scheduled regularity might seem mundane, but it’s quite the feat that operational reactors are as reliable and predictable as they are. It leaves some big shoes to fill for next-generation technology hoping to join the fleet in the next few years. Generally, nuclear reactors operate at constant levels, as close to full capacity as possible. In 2024, for commercial reactors worldwide, the average capacity factor—the ratio of actual energy output to the theoretical maxiumum—was 83%. North America rang in at an average of about 90%. (I’ll note here that it’s not always fair to just look at this number to compare different kinds of power plants—natural-gas plants can have lower capacity factors, but it’s mostly because they’re more likely to be intentionally turned on and off to help meet uneve…",

    "body": "OpenAI is testing another new way to expose the complicated processes at work inside large language models. Researchers at the company can make an LLM produce what they call a confession, in which the model explains how it carried out a task and (most of the time) owns up to any bad behavior. Figuring out why large language models do what they do—and in particular why they sometimes appear to lie, cheat, and deceive—is one of the hottest topics in AI right now. If this multitrillion-dollar technology is to be deployed as widely as its makers hope it will be, it must be made more trustworthy. OpenAI sees confessions as one step toward that goal. The work is still experimental, but initial results are promising, Boaz Barak, a research scientist at OpenAI, told me in an exclusive preview this week: “It’s something we’re quite excited about.” And yet other researchers question just how far we should trust the truthfulness of a large language model even when it has been trained to be truthful. A confession is a second block of text that comes after a model’s main response to a request, in which the model marks itself on how well it stuck to its instructions. The idea is to spot when an…",

Amazon Web Services has just revealed three new “frontier” AI agents, its term for a more sophisticated class of autonomous agents capable of working for days at a time without human intervention. One of them, called Kiro, is designed to work independently without the need for a human to constantly point it in the right direction.

He accomplished this feat through a revolutionary breakthrough in process design: Instead of skilled craftsmen building a car from scratch by hand, Ford created an assembly line where standardized tasks happened in sequence, at scale. The IT industry is having a similar moment of reinvention. Across operations from software development to cloud migration, organizations are adopting an AI-infused factory model that replaces manual, one-off projects with templated, scalable systems designed for speed and cost-efficiency. DOWNLOAD THE ARTICLE Take VMware migrations as an example. For years, these projects resembled custom production jobs—bespoke efforts that often took many months or even years to complete. Fluctuating licensing costs added a layer of complexity, just as business leaders began pushing for faster modernization to make their organizations AI-ready. That urgency has become nearly universal: According to a recent IDC report , six in 10 organizations evaluating or using cloud services say their IT infrastructure requires major transformation, while 82% report their cloud env…",

The State of AI: Welcome to the economic singularity —David Rotman and Richard Waters Any far-reaching new technology is always uneven in its adoption, but few have been more uneven than generative AI. That makes it hard to assess its likely impact on individual businesses, let alone on productivity across the economy as a whole. At one extreme, AI coding assistants have revolutionized the work of software developers. At the other extreme, most companies are seeing little if any benefit from their initial investments.&nbsp; That has provided fuel for the skeptics who maintain that—by its very nature as a probabilistic technology prone to hallucinating—generative AI will never have a deep impact on business. To students of tech history, though, the lack of immediate impact is normal. Read the full story .

An AI model trained on prison phone calls now looks for planned crimes in those calls A US telecom company trained an AI model on years of inmates’ phone and video calls and is now piloting that model to scan their calls, texts, and emails in the hope of predicting and preventing crimes. Securus Technologies president Kevin Elder told MIT Technology Review that the company began building its AI tools in 2023, using its massive database of recorded calls to train AI models to detect criminal activity. It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on models for other states and counties. However, prisoner rights advocates say that the new AI system enables a system of invasive surveillance, and courts have specified few limits to this power.
