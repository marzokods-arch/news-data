During a speech at the ICE Barcelona trade show (via Reuters ), the Gambling Commission's executive director Tim Miller said that anyone who has spent \"even a little time\" on Facebook or Instagram will have been served ads for illegal online casinos. Miller explained that Meta claims to remove any such ads when notified of their existence. But that implies Meta is unaware of these ads until being alerted to them by third parties. \"That is simply false,\" he said. According to Miller, Meta even tried to shift responsibility for sorting this all out onto the Gambling Commission. \"Their suggestion was that we should deploy AI tools ourselves to monitor and find these ads and then report them,\" he said. Miller also described Meta's searchable ad library as \"a window into criminality.\" All of this lead Miller to conclude, \"it could leave you with the impression they are quite happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking …",

With all this at the forefront of the company, it's no surprise that the technology is a large part of The Verge's extended conversation with CEO Min-Liang Tan at this year's CES. When asked how Razer decides which projects actually become real projects, Tan says: \"We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, 'Oh, do we do projections and things like that?' It’s really more of a 'by the seat of our pants' kind of thing. It's cool, we like it, it's gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it's cool, we'll bring it to market.\" Naturally, this leads Nilay Patel, the editor in chief of The Verge, to ask about what he calls the 'holographic anime waifu'. Tan compares it to the likes of Cortana from Halo and suggests it's always been a dream of gamers. \"It's a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like …",

    "body": "Back in the 1990s, my fellow PC chums and I thought we had stumbled across a magic trick with Windows 95, something that we thought nobody else knew about: holding the shift key when you hit restart just fired up the operating system again, not the whole PC. Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

When you find one of those in the midst of an already-ongoing sale, making it all even cheaper? Baby, that's the good stuff. Well, joyous news: you can now share that glee with your Steam pals. As spotted by SteamDB , Valve has recently pushed a change through that means you can now purchase these kinds of bundles as gifts.

The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Players were given the opportunity to vote in November as to whether they'd like the widely reviled Treasure Hunter microtransactions removed: Obviously, they said yes , and that's one of the first items on the 2026 roadmap unveiled today. The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game. Players will have the year to use up whatever items they've already bought, \"with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before [hundreds of gameplay-impacting MTX] items are ultimately made obsolete.\" Plenty more was shown off with the new roadmap. …",
