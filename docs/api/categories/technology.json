    "body": "Australia’s dedicated heavy metal cruise Hellbound will return in 2027 following overwhelming demand for its inaugural voyage, which sold out in under 10 minutes. The four-night cruise is set to sail Jan. 17–21, 2027 aboard Carnival Splendor, marking the second edition of the metal-focused experience created by Australian promoter Destroy All Lines in partnership with festival cruise company Choose Your Cruise. Organisers confirmed the sequel after the first Hellbound cruise, scheduled for October 2026, became the fastest sell-out in Choose Your Cruise’s 15-year history. Positioned as more than a traditional festival, Hellbound has been pitched as a floating heavy metal community, bringing together live performances, themed events and onboard programming tailored specifically for metal fans. The 2027 edition will again feature multiple stages, immersive activities and themed nights, alongside a port stop at Tangalooma on Moreton Island, offering a brief recovery window amid the onboard chaos. The lineup for Hellbound II will be revealed Feb. 2, with tickets going on sale Feb. 5 following a presale on Feb. 4. Organisers have not yet announced pricing tiers or capacity details, thou…",

The way it’s progressing, Google will soon know when your meeting is before you do. Back in October, it introduced the Help me schedule feature , which helped you suggest sensible meeting times based on your availability and the context of an email. That was useful, but it still left you to find out if the time worked for the other party. This latest update takes a bigger step by figuring out when everyone is actually free. According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar. When you’re creating an event, you’ll see a Suggested times option that uses Gemini to scan attendee availability, working hours, and existing conflicts, then surface the time slots that make the most sense for the whole group — assuming you have access to those calendars.

The updated AirTag also adds Precision Finding support on Apple Watch, making it easier to track items without pulling out your phone. Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

The app seemed to report much lower snowfall and higher temperatures than what actually occurred. The app’s AI weather report feature also made up a word, describing the day as “flurzy.” Google launched the Pixel Weather app back in 2024, and it’s a pretty neat and practical addition to Pixel phones . Unfortunately, many users have reported that the app offered woefully inaccurate weather forecasts in the wake of a recent snowstorm. Pixel owners have created numerous Reddit threads to report that the Pixel Weather app delivered incorrect weather forecasts during snowstorms in North America. More specifically, many owners report that the app reported much lower snowfall than what actually occurred.",

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

    "body": "Turning your phone into a mobile hotspot by sharing its data connection is an undeniably useful feature, but it does come with certain drawbacks when compared to using a dedicated mobile router. I generally avoid hotel, shopping mall, and airport Wi-Fi. This is down to security and privacy reasons. Some public Wi-Fi providers require you to sign up for an account to use their network, and there’s the risk of data snooping. As a result, I always use a mobile data connection when I’m out of the house. For quick outings, I’ll use my phone as a hotspot. But when I’m going to be out for a few hours, or I’m leaving for an overnight trip, I always use a mobile router instead.",

Been seeing bizarre, AI-generated headlines in Google Discover? That’s not an accident, Google says.

As The Verge ‘s Sean Hollister writes, Google has informed the publication that it will continue slapping AI-generated headlines on certain stories in Discover, a decision that, Google says, has been good for “user satisfaction.”",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud.

AI Mode in Search now blends public web results with your private context from Gmail and Photos to deliver answers tailored to you. Personal Intelligence is fully opt-in, with clear controls to connect or disconnect Gmail and Photos at any time. Last week, we saw Google finally tackle the context packing problem by bringing Personal Intelligence to the Gemini app , allowing the AI to actually remember details about your life instead of just fetching single files. Now, Google is bringing that same memory upgrade to the search bar. Starting today, Google is expanding Personal Intelligence to AI Mode in Search . Search used to focus on indexing the world’s information, but now it can understand your own information. It combines public web results with your private data to give you answers that fit you.",

Google has spent the past year slowly threading Material 3 Expressive through Android and its first-party apps.

Instead of recording the caller’s message as a voicemail, it may allow them to hear you in the background. The bug appears to affect all supported Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 4. If you have no time to go through all your voicemails, Google’s “Take a Message” feature for Pixel devices can be really useful. If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well. While very useful in theory, it has reportedly been malfunctioning, letting callers hear you instead of recording their message. Several users have highlighted this issue with Take a Message on their Pixel phones over the last few months. These reports, spotted by 9to5Google , are not limited…",
