This is effectively a bestiary, taking note of every mob you stumble across as you explore, whether they're a peaceful farm animal or a disgusting floating eyeball. However, you won't have access to Memories immediately. You've no doubt seen the prompt in the inventory screen to 'find the Forgotten Temple'—yeah, that's for the Memories. Since it's a progression system based on exploration, I recommend you unlock it as soon as you can, so here's what you need to do. How to unlock Memories at the Forgotten Temple in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) First you have to unlock the Memory system, which requires you to find the Forgotten Temple. There are multiple dotted around the map, but in my experience, there should be a Forgotten Temple near where you first spawn, which will be marked on your map with a portal icon. Head inside the building and take the stairs down behind the altar, where you'll find an earthen golem guarding a portal. The golem is easy enough to kill with copper weapons and armour, but if you don't have them, you can ac…",

Unfortunately, the certificates it relies on to carry out this task are expiring in June this year, which has kicked Microsoft into action to start issuing replacements to PCs in need of them via Windows updates. The latest security update, KB5074109 , will start a process of checking whether a PC is using the expiring Secure Boot certificates (2011 CA) and provide the newer certificates (2023 CA) if so. As Microsoft notes, many existing PCs have these newer certificates already. The CA 2011 certificates are the original Secure Boot certificates and Microsoft recommends OEMs ship the newer CA 2023 certificates with Windows 11 25H2 devices to prevent issues when the older certificates expire. However, there may still be some machines without the latest certificates, and come June, Secure Boot can no longer be trusted to verify firmware modules if that's still the case. \"Many Windows PCs manufactured since 2024 already have the updated 2023 certificates\" Microsoft says in a blog post . \"For the remaining devices, Microsoft is delivering…",

In an updated blog post , Framework says that memory prices from its suppliers \"continue to increase rapidly\". Apparently, 128 Gbit chips have been hit hardest by the price spikes. And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.

That's why I felt a twinge of scepticism in me today when I spotted this report from IGN pointing out players on the Arc Raiders subreddit found you can magically get better aim by cranking up your fps. But I've tested it, and it's true. This saga all started when a viewer of streamer Nickmercs noticed Nick's aim snapped onto Arcs (the bots in the game) as he was shooting. Nick uses a controller, which is key to the whole affair. After some took to accusing the previous Faze member of cheating , others discovered that the aim assist for controller players appears to be stronger in Arc Raiders, the higher your fps is. With the PC Gamer RTX 5070 Ti rig, I set everything to low, dynamic lighting to static, and resolution to 1080p and managed to get up to 300 fps without frame generation. It's possible to cap the frame rate in the game's settings, so I have all I need to test this theory out. I discovered that Reddit is actually right about this one. Shock horror, I know. At 300 fps, I discovered a few quirks when it co…",

    "body": "In an industry whose most recent high-profile buyouts cost tens of billions of dollars, the December sale of GOG—for the relatively humble sum of around $25 million—might seem like barely a ripple in the pond. But the impact of the buyout was incommensurate with its cost. For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

Right now Elder Scrolls fans are huffing the copium thanks to a Microsoft tease that 2026 will be a \" big year for games ending in 6 \", but the reality is there's no indication what date Bethesda is aiming for with the next Elder Scrolls. That's one hell of a stretch, even for a marquee title, and our man reckons it's because Bethesda didn't want Starfield's debut to be overshadowed by the absence of The Elder Scrolls. \"My assumption was always that we were announcing Starfield,\" says Purkeypile, \"and it had been so long already since Skyrim that we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us. It’s a very expensive way to do that, though.

Kept you waiting, huh? The warbond's main attractions are its silenced primary weapons. The R-72 Censor is a semi-auto precision rifle with an integrated suppressor for taking out enemies undetected at long range. For quietly clearing an area at closer quarters, there's also the AR-59 Suppressor, a silenced full-auto assault rifle. Technically speaking, the Redacted Regiment weapons won't be Helldivers 2's first suppressed primaries: That honor goes to the M7S SMG that was added with the ODST crossover warbond.
