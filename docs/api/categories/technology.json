Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer.

Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it.

The Honor Magic 8 Pro brings impressive specs such as a 200MP telephoto camera, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset , and a 6,270mAh battery capacity. However, Honor is already gearing up to launch another Magic 8 Pro variant, and it now has an official launch date. Recent teasers and rumors pointed toward Honor launching an ultra-slim version of the Magic 8 Pro, and the company confirmed in a Weibo post that this device will launch later this month as the Magic 8 Pro Air. The handset will be revealed on January 19 in China, which is less than two weeks away. The launch teaser video doesn’t reveal much about the Magic 8 Pro Air, instead comparing the power and thinness of t…",

Conversation focus is meant to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to to make conversation easier in noisy environments. The feature is available to try on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses. Most smart glasses aren’t explicitly made to be accessibility tools, but it’s easy to imagine ways they could be used to that end. Take Meta’s conversation focus, which uses smart glasses’ built-in speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to in noisy environments. The feature was announced months ago, but now, it’s rolling out in a limited test. Meta announced its conversation focus feature at the company’s Connect event in September, and users have been able to sign up for a waitlist to try it since December. UploadVR spotted today that the feature is actually making its way to users who’ve signed up for Meta’s Early Access program.",

We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ).

While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them.

Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.
