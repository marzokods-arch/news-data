With Asetek's 20-year patent on AIO coolers expiring earlier this year, the market has seen a flood of new models, all at vastly reduced prices. That's been good for us PC builders. However, for cooling companies, it's become increasingly harder to make something that stands out from the crowd. Enter stage left, the Jonsbo TF3-360SCB , which (to quote the great Marge Simpson) I think is just neat.

Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games.

It's a substantial roll call. But Windows remains under threat, most obviously from Valve's Steam OS, but also arguably from its own crumminess. Microsoft groups the gaming enhancements it delivered in 2025 into three broad groups: handheld innovation, Windows on Arm, and DirectX. Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally. ASD delivers precompiled shaders at install time, eliminating most of the wait time and stuttering when you launch a game for the first time.

Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes.

Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance?

    "body": "As much as I love tinkering, taking any sort of electronic apart is my worst nightmare. I just know the second I do, all the tiny screws will go missing and I'll be left with something far more broken than it was in the first place. Fortunately, thanks to the reveal of shop simulator ReStory during the Wholesome Snack showcase, I no longer have to worry about trying to mend my own belongings and can instead take responsibility for mending others' belongings. In the premiere trailer for ReStory, we get a first glimpse at what life would be like running a repair shop in early 2000s Tokyo. Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny. From the few examples we've seen in the trailer, each item you mend feels like an intricate puzzle. You'll have to snap a tonne of individual pieces back together while rot…",

    "body": "I absolutely adore an odd dating simulator. I loved and sank an embarrassing amount of time into Sucker for Love, Hatoful Boyfriend, and Lovebirb, so it's no surprise that the trailer for CatchMaker shown during the Wholesome Snack showcase immediately piqued my interest. However, it's quite a deceptive first look. Initially, I thought I was looking at a sweet bug-catching simulator, but it quickly pulls in dating sim elements in a significant change of pace. As you run around, you will in fact catch bugs, but it's what you do with them after that gets me excited to play. Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out. The example given in the trailer shows a butterfly and a slug coming together for dinner, but as you watch them interact it turns out there are by no means a compatible pair. So, it's your job as the bug catcher overlord to find the perfect match for each insect. As you watch these date sequences, bugs will express their likes and dislikes, such as a hard shell or a certain amount of eyes. You know, all those features you probably think of every…",

    "body": "I loved the laid-back life of Cozy Caravan when I played the early access version in May last year, so the announcement of its 1.0 release coming on January 8, 2026, is incredibly exciting. In a new trailer shown during the Wholesome Snack showcase, we get another look at its easygoing lifestyle through some sweeping shots of the towns you'll explore, alongside some familiar faces if you've been enjoying the game in early access. However, if you're yet to explore the world of Cozy Caravan, then you are in for a treat. But, before you can delve in, you need to make an animal avatar. Rather than this being your typical cat or dog, you're given a wonderful selection of critters to choose from too, including an opossum and raccoon, or even an axolotl if you're more keen on amphibians. Once you've made the impossible selection, you'll be unleashed into the game and get to experience what life as a mobile market is like. Unleashed might give the wrong impression, because Cozy Caravan is exactly what its title suggests: an incredibly relaxing game with little to no restrictions or rules. In fact, you use this caravan to set up a travelling market stall where you can stock items you've cr…",

    "body": "I don't mean to harp on the scare chord, but more and more manufacturers are feeling the heat from the memory pricing apocalypse. The latest cohort includes HP, Lenovo, and Dell, all of which have reportedly told customers to expect new year price hikes. Industry sources claim Dell may raise its prices as soon as mid-December, and by as much as 20%. Lenovo on the other hand has apparently told customers that all of its current quotes will expire as of January 1, 2026 (via TrendForce ). Why? You guessed it: memory shortages and surging prices , driven by the demands of big tech's AI pipedreams. HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes. The modular laptop maker had previously delisted its own standalone memory to 'head off scalpers' , and more recently pos…",
