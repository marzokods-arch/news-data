It's not that I'm friendly, but I am absolutely cowardly. Gimme some AI to stomp, rather than a sweaty gamer who might—god forbid—actually be better at the game than me. This is why the only extraction shooter I've really vibed with is the striking, atmospheric, PvE-only The Forever Winter . But with Arc Raiders being all anyone can talk about at the moment, I thought I should at least check it out. Arc Raiders shares some similarities with The Forever Winter, with its biggest threats all being robotic monstrosities, and with players all serving as desperate scavengers. And I was intrigued by what I heard about the community: that murder was not the end result of every meeting of players . (Image credit: Embark) But the moment I met my first group of also-humans, I went into my default mode, more than three decades of gaming teaching me to shoot first, ask questions not at all.

Google has recently warned \"adversaries are no longer leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) just for productivity gains, they are deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations\". The report (via Bleeping Computer ) says that, for the first time, Google \"discovered a code family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behaviour.\" Google pays attention to one particular malware named Promptflux, which is a dropper that prompts Gemini to rewrite its own source code, \"saving the new, obfuscated version to the Startup folder to establish persistence.\" Like an actual virus, this suggests it has the ability to 'evolve' in some way, getting smarter and harder to get rid of.

Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer.

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers. Not all of it…",

The lure of doing something perfectly normal on terra firma in the utterly hostile environment of space is just the preserve of a handful of coders, though, as two companies are hoping to be the first to have a data center and, believe it or not, a chip foundry in orbit. This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project. The reason behind it all is that if you have satellites in a synchronous low Earth orbit, they're exposed almost continuously to sun…",

You're only given the rough areas to search and you definitely don't want to spend more time there than you need to. So, here's where you need to look to find the required shipping notes and scanners to complete A Lay of the Land. How to complete A Lay of the Land in Arc Raiders The A Lay of the Land mission has two main steps: finding shipping notes in Jiangsu Warehouse and locating LiDAR scanners in Control Tower A6. It's important to note that you need to extract with the scanner quest item to tick this quest off, so I recommend against a free loadout so that you have access to a safe pocket. You can place the scanner in your safe pocket so you don't lose it if you die, forcing you to return on another run.

Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe. According to Fortune , it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir. In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price. In practice, put options are typically a device with which to bet against company, the idea being that if the price of the company goes down by the time the option matures, that gives you the opportunity, in effect, to buy the stock at the lower price and then resell at the h…",

That said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

If you're anything like me, you've been lulled into the Mobility tree to become the Flash, only to realise that half the skills—mainly the later ones—don't work like you think they would based on what you're told in-game. The only solution? Build a caravan over the next few weeks to retire your raider in the first Expedition Project . To get the good news out of the way, lots of the best skills in the Mobility tree are right at the start, like Marathon Runner and Youthful Lungs.

And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO.

It seems the variant we always wanted to see, which majors in graphics rather than CPU grunt, is set to be released. Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database . The most exciting model is the Ryzen AI Max+ 388. That combines eight CPU cores with the maximum 40 graphics compute unit count available from Strix Halo. Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld. In practice, Strix Halo has therefore thus far been of more interest as a tool for running local AI models on a limited budget than for gaming.

One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache.
