And I was right (partially because I'm one of them), but also, it's just a really clever little game. I could talk on and on about how it de-incentivises toxicity, has some really neat boss and class designs, and a progression system that constantly rewards you instead of de-levelling your key and taking your lunch money. And I might. But the thing I'm really impressed by is one tiny little UI feature that solves a problem that's been plaguing World of Warcraft (and other MMOs) for years. Decades, even. See, in MMOs, a secondary responsibility for damage dealers—other than blasting—is interrupting enemy spellcasting. Usually, specific abilities need to be interrupted or else the pull of that particular dungeon gets way harder. This adds a nice layer of coordination if you're playing with your friends, but let's face it—the majority of dungeon runs are probably done with pick-up groups, right?

The AIO in question looks to be an MSI MPG CoreLiquid P13 360 , and yes, that cooler does actually let you use the screen as an extended display rather than just importing gifs or video files to replay on it. Which means this very likely is Battlefield 6 (BF6) actually playing on the little screen, rather than a streamed video or moving image. It doesn't look like the game's all too playable on the round screen, though—half of the HUD is cut off. Our Jacob Ridley discovered this HUD-chopping effect himself when he tried the cooler's hand at playing Doom in-browser.

Since then, the ministry says that the NSA used 42 types of \"special cyberattack weapons\" to disrupt the internal network systems, and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024—although no evidence was provided in the post to backup these claims. \"The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself,\" the post continues. \"Repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats.\" After discovering the breach, the min…",

It's ahead of GTA 5 Enhanced, Dune: Awakening, and Football Manager 2020, and just a hair off the personal records of Warframe and Stellar Blade. It's worth nothing that the game hit its peak pretty early in the server test, mind you. Right as things picked up, we brought you news that the game had slipped just part 185,000 players.

In the meantime I stayed up trying to find out as much as I possibly could about the characters and setting. When Little Nightmares 2 launched it took me a single day to get through. You literally couldn't have peeled me away from it if you tried. So, when the third game was announced in 2023, the excitement started all over again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first game of the series to be developed by Supermassive Games rather than Tarsier Studios. Despite this change, it certainly looks the exact same as the other two games. When you begin the adventure, you awaken in a strange environment overwhelmed by a feeling of dread, and everything around you looks gigantic to really emphasise how small you are as a child. The same goes for the various humanlike creatures you encounter, alongside the main villains, all of which tower over you. In previous games, one of the things that made the villains so scary w…",

There are multiple lessons here, not the least of which is that red kites are bloody brilliant and we should have more of them to keep those pigeons in check.

Though it's not on sale right now, I've seen it discounted at both Amazon and Best Buy multiple times over the last few months. At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases. However, down to $100, it makes a lot more sense, and isn't too far from the prices of standard 1080p webcams.

Speaking with PC Gamer US editor-in-chief Tyler Wilde, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said the shared timing made for a fortuitous opportunity. \"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen,\" Watkins said. \"It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa.

Timing aside, when PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park played both back-to-back earlier this year, he noted \"both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit,\" adding he was \"skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.\" For Watki…",

Last year, he said there's a worrisome wave of game directors content with \"Hollywood-style\" music, adding even then that AI tools would prevent composers from \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\" More recently, he lamented a perceived stagnation in game music, with too many composers aping John Williams.

Personally, the absolute last thing I want to do after putting a 30+ hour game to bed is immediately start playing it again, but it appears I am in the minority on this. Elsewhere, the next few weeks will also introduce 'Legend Levels', a new nightmare difficulty, extra weapon executions, and ray tracing on PC.

    "body": "Sci-fi extraction shooter Arc Raiders is doing one last public playtest this weekend before its launch at the end of October, but quite a few players felt it was already good to go after its successful April playtest—or just wanted it to release ASAP so they could keep playing, perhaps more accurately. That Arc playtest compared favorably to a parallel Marathon playtest, as Morgan pointed out at the time , and was praised for its technical soundness. But the plan then was to release Arc in October (although the date hadn't yet been announced) and it stayed that way, because despite the fans angling for a surprise drop, it was \"absolutely not ready,\" design director Virgil Watkins told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"It was interesting to see how many people wanted us to drop it, or even shortly after [the playtest], expected us to drop the game,\" said Watkins. \"But on our end, the game was absolutely not ready. I'm happy that a lot of people thought the game ran well, but we had a lot of optimization to still do. We had a bunch of features we still needed to finish. There were bugs, and thankfully they didn't show up too much in a lot of people's footage, but there were some …",

    "body": "Arc Raiders looks great: My pals at PC Gamer think it's the most exciting thing to happen to the extraction genre in a long time, and the huge numbers the server slam playtest is putting up at this very moment prove that they're not alone in thinking so. For me, though, there's just one problem: It's a third-person shooter, and I don't like third-person shooters. That leads me to a second problem: The odds of Arc Raiders ever getting a first-person mode are basically zero. That little spot of disappointment comes from Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins, who told PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde in a recent interview that the game was built around the third-person perspective, and that shifting to a first-person view doesn't \"give us a benefit of any sort.\" \"I think so much of our immersion and world and the interactions that your character has with the things in the world, the enemies, the other players, is so amplified by the quality that's come from our animation team and our audio team and our environment team, that it works together as this very nice package that you can really place your character in that world,\" Watkins said. \"That's not to say that's not possible in first per…",
