Though AI is ever becoming the buzzword when it comes to major tech events like CES, that doesn't mean there won't also be some interesting hardware to grab your attention. After all, last year saw some excellent GPUs, need laptops, great handhelds, and even actual good uses of AI. Who knew? We know the likes of AMD and Nvidia both have keynote speeches during the week, alongside dozens of other companies, and we'll even have a few members of the PC Gamer team there on the ground floor to get their grubby mitts (and fingerprints) all over that lovely new tech.

It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions. Otherwise, KotOR 2, Mask of the Betrayer, New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, Tyranny, and Deadfire are all games that took years to achieve cult classic status, let alone the couple that have finally become universally acknowledged classics.

That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat. There's not so much as a competitive ranked mode of play in BF6, and…",

    "body": "When it comes to GPUs and graphics technology, I know what I'd like to see in 2026. Super-modern processors that are a substantial leap forward in terms of performance, capabilities, and affordability. We won't get that, of course, because we didn't get that this year. Or last year. But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course. When it's all working as intended, Quality or Balanced upscaling at most resolutions does an incredible job, and I always enable it in every game that supports the most recent versions. Alas, I c…",

    "body": "If there's a single throughline for the PC gaming year that was 2025, it's finally accepting that the pursuit of fancy graphics just doesn't make sense anymore. Tech has hit a hard graphics plateau: raw generational updates are now nuanced upgrades measured in single-digit frame gains rather than evolutions anyone with eyes can appreciate, and the subsequent pivot to AI-generated frames and experimental hair follicles aren't really revving anyone's engines when those upgrades cost a month's rent. Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby. A bright spot of 2025 was the continued rise of \"friendslop,\" a cringey internet-spawned label for a broad genre of cooperative games designed for groups of friends. Peak and REPO were the big hits this calendar year, but they're of a kind with Phasmophobia and Lethal Company—all were among the best-selling Steam games of their release years, and it's no coincidence that they'll all run on a budget PC from nine years ago.

    "body": "For a hearty chunk of 2025, Fortnite was fallow. It'd be an exaggeration to say the game's subreddit was pure misery between June and November, but there was more than enough gloom to go around: the novelty of a Star Wars cameo quickly wore off and the next two seasons, Super and Shock 'N Awesome, felt bland and messy. When players finally departed Oninoshima, Chapter 6's map, it was a sloppy soup of disconnected ideas, with First Order bases straddling bug-fighting military outposts and buildings from feudal Japan. I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons. Random boss spawns meant literally anyone had a chance of grabbing exotic weapons, and it showed how a few wacky items can transform battle royale for the better …",

We knew we were getting the druid because it didn't quite make the cut for 0.3, but apart from that it seemed a little mopey—no new campaign bits, a league mechanic we already recognized from PoE1, and most importantly, no endgame changes. I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills. When the druid rears up on its hind legs in bear form to smack things with Maul, you feel huge . The smacks are meaty and crunchy, and when you slam back down to do the second part of the…",
