This is a system that can learn to simulate real-world things, which might allow for 'easy' creation of realistic games. And that seems to have been on Elon Musk's mind, as his xAI has been hiring Nvidia specialists to work on just such AI models. That's according to the Financial Times , which cites \"two people familiar with the plans\" and says the two new hires, Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, have experience working on world models. Apparently, the creations are intended to help create game environments. That tracks, too, given Musk's previous comments : \"The XAI game studio will release a great AI-generated game before the end of next year.\" If these world models are put towards game world creation, I'm sure we'll have a whole bunch of new AI slop to look forward to. I mean, just look at the aforementioned X post—Musk is responding to a clip of a game that looks absolutely atrocious. I'm sure it will allow for lots of bespoke and custom game scenes, of course.

But what was certain was that a large chunk of the VRMs were now missing, which meant power could no longer reach the chip itself (via Videocardz ). However, YouTuber Paulo Gomez took it upon themselves to see what they could do for the stricken graphics card, and arrived at an unusual solution: wiring in the VRMs still attached to an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card to provide electrical assistance to the fallen RTX 5070 Ti . And holy hell, it appears to have worked. The AMD card was rigged with a series of electrical wires to bypass the missing VRMs, and was left riding piggyback aboard its much-more-powerful competitor. There's something uncomfortably medical about the whole affair, what with the sequence of wires resembling hospital tubes—but lo and behold, the RTX 5070 Ti now provides an output signal once more.

Path of Exile 2 YouTuber and streamer XTheFarmerX stumbled into an incredible idea for a competition a few days ago: Call on the world's strongest players and have them fight one-on-one with a shark injected with the deadliest modifiers you can find. The endgame loop in Path of Exile 2 basically involves running maps and defeating bosses. Each map can have additional difficulty modifiers crafted onto it to increase the potential rewards. Some of those mods can be brutal, like bonus health to all monsters or full immunity to certain types of elemental damage. The point of the system is to pick and choose which mods your character can handle. But it also means you can create maps that are so nasty that even the best players can't survive. That's the idea with XTheFarmerX's Boss Bash Bonanza , except the only goal is to defeat the shark boss that has trillions of extra health and damage, and a t…",

It isn't just a level pack either. Horror Castle introduces 24 new enemies including wandering skeletons, vampire bats, and Nosferatu-like bloodsuckers, as well as four minibosses from D3D with the added bonus of being able to shrink them and stomp them to death. Horror Castle also equips Duke with four additional weapons. Duke can toss enormous spiders to attack enemies, then blast them with skeletal shrapnel using the Bone Crusher, a weapon reminiscent of the Ravager from Doom: The Dark Ages .

By far and away the best demo I played during those days was for a little game called Sektori . If you haven't heard of Sektori, it's a geometric shoot 'em up in the vein of Housemarque's Resogun and Nex Machina , before they became all about ultra-hard third-person shooters like Returnal and the upcoming Saros . There's good reason for the similarity. Sektori's creator, Kimmo Lahtinen, worked at Housemarque for 13 years, before departing to pursue his own projects, like a hack 'n' slash game called Barbarian, and a match-3 life sim called Day Repeat Day. Neither of these games made much impact, and I don't know whether they deserved to or not. But I believe Sektori does. Housemarque's lineage oozes from every glowing, spinning polygon. You control a little 3D arrow (known in-game as a 'ship') blasting shapes as they spawn all around a top-down arena. If you get touched by any shape or projectile, the game is instantly over.

    "body": "It sure looks like Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 is in development, and it could be set for a surprise launch before the end of the year. While this apparent sequel to Cold Iron Studios' 2021 blaster hasn't been officially announced yet, it has seemingly been rated by the ESRB. As spotted by Gematsu (via PCGamesN ) a listing for Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2 briefly appeared on the website for the ESRB—the US' entertainment ratings body. The page, which has since been taken down, awarded Fireteam Elite 2 a \"Mature\" rating for \"Blood and Gore, Strong Language and Violence\" (sounds like an Aliens game!). The page also mentioned the sequel was being published by Daybreak Games Company (as opposed to Focus Entertainment, the original game's publisher) and that it's coming to PC as well as PS5 and Xboxes large and small. Since games only tend to get rated close to release, this would suggest that a surprise launch for Fireteam Elite 2 is imminent. Of course, the rating could be some weird mistake, but the info that was displayed on the page tracks with rumours surrounding a possible sequel, as well as statements previously made by both Cold Iron and Daybreak. In October 2023, Cold Iron explained…",

Corpos like Randy Pitchford think we should stop moaning and fork out for a better PC, as playing the best-looking games simply demands a rig capable of lighting a small town. But perhaps there's another way, one where good design and technical ingenuity can remove some of the sting from system requirements. In a roundabout way, this was recently demonstrated by modder, YouTuber, and mapper Goonya's Animations , who took a map he was making for Half-Life 2 and somehow made it run in Half-Life 1's GoldSrc engine with minimal visual difference. In a video titled \"This is GoldSrc\", Goonya showed off the map in action. The video starts with a run-through of the Half-Life 2 version of the map, which is midway through development. Its handful of corridors includes a room filled with computer terminals and faux-digital displays, and tiled floors with fetching phong-shaded reflections. In descriptive captions running through the video, Goonya notes that he \"used [Half-Li…",

The Control spinoff shooter FBC: Firebreak stumbled badly at launch, putting up a peak concurrent player count on Steam of just under 2,000 on release day and quickly slumping to under 100 less than a month later. Remedy fired out some quick patches and committed to more significant changes, the first of which went live near the end of September . That sparked a small bump in the concurrent player count, but it quickly slumped back down to double-digit numbers. Remedy's next quarterly financial report is set for October 29, but it's not waiting until then to deliver the bad news. \"In its 2025 half-year financial report, Remedy reported that FBC: Firebreak’s launch-phase consumer sales underperformed,\" the studio said in today's update . \"After the launch, the company rapidly developed the game based on player feedback and released multiple updates. \"On September 29, Remedy released the first Major Update tit…",
