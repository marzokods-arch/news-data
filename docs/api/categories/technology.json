The Goblin King quests are some of the more annoying tasks, and it's not enough to just complete one for his highness and move on. There are five Goblin King quests in The Forge, each a little more difficult (and expensive) to complete than the last. It's a nice bit of XP, but the biggest incentive for appeasing the Roblox royalty is access to a new location—the same one you need for another sidequest, Find Tomo's Lost Cat. Some of the Goblin King's asks get awfully tedious, so I suggest redeeming active The Forge codes to help you prepare with a few extra spins or free luck totems. How to complete every Goblin King quest in The Forge (Image credit: FireAtacck / Roblox) You'll have to bring the Goblin King money and an array of rare ore in all five of The Forge's sidequests.

According to a report from Rest of World , the optimal temperature range for a data centre lies between 18 °C and 27 °C (or 64.4 °F and 80.6 °F). However, of the 8,808 data centres in operation, 7,000 have been built in places that typically experience a climate outside of this range. Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency . However, add to that a cooling system that's having to fight against the everyday climate it finds itself in, and that potentially adds up to an even greater strain on the local grid.

With that in mind, it's reassuring to find that laptops based on Panther Lake have popped up on more one etailer, albeit presumably by accident. MSI's Prestige laptops, in both 14- and 16-inch formats, and ranging from roughly 2,000 Euros to 2,500 Euros, or about $2,300 to $3,000, appeared on a French etailer , though it's far from clear if the pricing is final. All of the various models were listed with 32 GB of RAM, which is notable given the ongoing RAMpocolypse . But perhaps the most interesting are the variants with Panther Lake 'X' chips. That includes the Intel Core Ultra X7 358H and the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H. Both of those chips get the big Panther Lake CPU die, making for a total of four Performance, eight Efficient, and four low-power Efficient CPU cores. The 'X' prefix is the really intriguing bit, however, and is thought to refer to Panther Lake SKUs with the larger GPU chiplet containing 12 Xe3 GPU cores.

At the end of November, commercial font service Fontworks ended its most affordable license plan, LETS (Leading Edge Type Solution), which originally allowed game devs to use their Japanese fonts for only 60,000 yen (or about $380) a year. Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being. But why such an astronomical price hike in the first place? Allegedly, heavy investment in AI that did not pay off for the c…",

Even the title is a calligram: the umlauted O is our hero—the umlaut represents their ears—while the lowercase os are the bombs they carry around. In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.

After all, the original Corsair One, while admittedly smol, was a noisy ol' chimney of a PC. But the current design—a bit taller, a bit deeper—is far more suited to the task of keeping both high-end CPU and GPU combinations in check. While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill. There's a radiator in the top of the chassis that cools the graphics card and one in the side, which folds open, to look after the CPU…",

The publisher has become one of the most prolific—certainly within strategy and management games—with its recent releases including 9 Kings, Cataclismo, Endless Legend 2 and Manor Lords.

Bender says that as he's scrolling through Steam, \"everything is designed to help me discover games\". I can find it hard to sift through the vast number of games released every month, but to be honest I can't fault the Discovery system: it's always spitting out stuff that's in my wheelhouse.

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

But honestly, all I ever really wanted was a good skin. A nice unique cosmetic was always my primary motivation for doing the Expedition project, not just because of the bragging rights, but because I like cosmetic options in games. Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam. But now the Expedition window has actually opened up and we can see a thumbnail of the outfit, things are looking good . As TheWreckedTitan points out on Reddit, the Expedition skin is most likely the tutorial skin we all wore at the start of the game, a cool little cosmetic that makes you look like y…",

It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions,\" he says. In mitigation, Enzor-DeMeo also says that the AI element in Firefox will be optional. \"First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off,\" Enzor-DeMeo explains.

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

If you lose the key, it's basically up to RNG whether you get another, so you're a bit stuck. Luckily, the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, where you have to go, has a lot more foot traffic, so chances are even without the key, you'll still be able to get it.
