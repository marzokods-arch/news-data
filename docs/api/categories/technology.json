Android’s release cycle sounds simple on paper, but it’s anything but. Scratch the surface, and you’ll find a maze of previews, betas, and other mysterious builds that often just go over your head. Android releases don’t move in a straight line, from ‘under development’ to ‘released’. Multiple versions of the operating system exist at the same time, at different stages of development, and are meant for completely different audiences. What creates confusion is that all of them are discussed simultaneously on online forums. The confusion spirals further when you add Pixel-exclusive features , leaked experiments, and the constant noise enthusiasts create on social media.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A new report found dozens of AI “nudify” and face-swap apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Despite policies against sexual nudity, these apps were distributed through the app stores. Many of the apps generated significant revenue from in-app purchases, of which the platforms take as much as a 30% cut. Many of these apps were removed following the report, but several are still available for download. AI is one of the most powerful tools available these days, and you can do so much with it. But, like any tool, it can be used for good or bad . Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed social media users using X’s Grok AI chatbot in lewd ways, primarily to create sexualized imagery of women without their consent. As it turns out, it’s not just Grok that has been at the center of this undressing scandal, as both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store allegedly hosted “nudify” apps.

The Phone 4a Pro gets a subtle increment in the battery, but retains the same 50W charging speed. The other big improvement is the water protection rating, now IP65. Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand. A more recent leak now reveals the charging speed and the slightly increased battery capacity.",

Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch .

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Apple just updated 10+ year-old devices to extend a digital certificate that keeps iMessage, FaceTime, and device setup working past 2027. Without this fix, these devices would slowly break. Once the certificate expired, they’d lose access to Apple’s servers and core features. The update is about functional life support, not new features; devices remain on old iOS 12 and many modern apps won’t work. Supporting a smartphone for more than a decade sounds almost impossible with how quickly new models come out these days, as in the case of Android models . But this week, Apple did just that by releasing a software update for iPhones that were first released more than 10 years ago. Apple has quietly released iOS 12.5.8, a surprise update for legacy hardware that can’t run modern versions of iOS, as spotted by a Reddit user . This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the original iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 and 3, and even the sixth-generation iPod touch.",

However, since I need to stay updated on developments like this, I gritted my teeth and jumped in with both feet. My first AI browser, Arc Search , was surprisingly good. It was less a browser and more a souped-up search experience, but I did enjoy how it handled search queries. While I didn’t see it as a primary browser — it would never replace Firefox on my Android phone — I was disappointed when The Browser Company announced new things and left Arc behind.",
