With its Fortnite-adjacent aesthetic and focus on co-op, Chip 'N Clawz is worlds away from the devastatingly challenging X-Com, or even the more streamlined modern incarnation. And when you're so firmly associated with a specific game or series, as Gollop is, any deviation from that formula can be jarring. So his comment that he's not really trying to appeal to that audience might come as a surprise. But he argues that there's still something for strategy fans to be found within this new adventure. \"I think there's enough strategy in there for strategy fans, for sure,\" he says. But \"there's not too much complexity,\" he acknowledges, \"particularly in the way the game is controlled or the way it's understood\". But Gollop isn't worried if his hardcore fans aren't into it. \"That's not a problem,\" he says. \"There are other people that it would appeal to.\" What he really wants is to bring in new players…",

According to TrendForce's investigations , \"nearline\" HDDs are \"facing severe supply shortages\", which is pushing cloud providers towards QLC SSDs. Nearline HDDs are ones used for infrequently accessed data, acting neither as cold (long-term) nor hot (rapidly accessible) storage but something in between. They're primarily used for data such as backups. The AI boom has meant there's more of this storage in demand than before, to keep previous AI training data and model roll-backs, for instance. One recent example of this increased demand comes from Western Digital. The company recently split from its SSD arm, Sandisk, to focus entirely on HDDs. TrendForce relays a notice from the company that was \"spotted by industry sources\" and explains that there is \"unprecedented demand for every capacity in our portfolio.\" Consequently, WD \"will be gradually implementing price increases on all HDD products, effective immediately.\" It will also expand its \"use of ocean freight\", which will increase transport time by a few weeks but \"significantly r…",

I found one of the early weapon upgrades and kind of stuck with that for the next 30 hours. It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

'Proper' office furniture can easily cost double that of the best gaming chair , and sometimes even more than that. Right here I have my bottom parked on a Humanscale Freedom Headrest task chair, and it's a serious grown up chair. And it's also $2000. I guess, in the sort of office where you've spent at least that much on your pink iMac and the same again on some beautifully engineered 'executive toy', that sort of outlay to support your spine and sooth your buttocks makes sense. But can we justify that as a PC gamer? Honestly, this PC gamer cannot.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",
