It is rumored that the situation will get even worse, as the Galaxy S26 is expected to be virtually identical to its predecessor, beyond a minor processor upgrade and a few other small refinements. I get the urge to feel like manufacturers are phoning it in (pun semi-intended), and that a change is needed.

With just a few weeks to the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series, we’re now approaching the point of marketing material leaking out. After a seemingly official poster emerged earlier in the week, followed by a short-lived listing with multiple colors on a low-profile e-commerce website, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is cropping up again, this time in a bold 360º video. The latest Galaxy S26 Ultra leak comes from leaker Evan Blass on X and flaunts the phone’s different side profiles in Cobalt Violet color. This is also perhaps the clearest, highest-quality leak for the Galaxy S26 series, so much so that it looks like Blass snagged it directly from the top marketing teams at Samsung headquarters.",

Lyrics translations are now available worldwide, while offline lyrics are limited to Premium subscribers.

As an avid language learner , I’m always told that listening to music in that language is a good way to pick up new words. That’s a lot easier if you can actually understand what’s being said, so I’ve often wondered why I couldn’t get translated lyrics on Spotify — especially after meeting people who somehow already had access to them. I even put the feature on my wishlist back in 2024. It turns out there’s been a long-running test I wasn’t a part of, but it looks like my wait is finally over. According to an announcement on the Spotify Newsroom , the company is rolling out three upgrades to its Lyrics feature, covering translations, offline access, and how lyrics are displayed while a song is playing.

The finding follows previous reports that Samsung plans to produce a million units of the Wide Fold, higher than any previous special edition foldable. Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US.

Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks.
