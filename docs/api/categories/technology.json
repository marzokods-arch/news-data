In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4 , Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, \"If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories.\" Huang argues, \"The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom\". \"You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year.\" Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI . This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming . Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. @c4news CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen…",

It never set the world on fire, is my point, but fear not, because Amazon knows exactly how to revive it: an \"AI-powered\" social game starring Snoop Dogg. Obviously. What else could it possibly have been? To be fair, AI judge Snoop isn't the sum total of Amazon's plans for Luna. It's the flagship title for its pivot into a couch co-op-focused service. The \"all-new Amazon Luna\" will still have big-budget games on it, but the emphasis will very much be on more casual stuff you can play with friends and family.

I won't lecture you about upgrading your PC, as I assume you're in this situation because 1) you can't , or 2) you don't want to. I respect it. You're not alone: 32% of Steam gamers surveyed in September 2025 have yet to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11. If that's a similar figure outside of the gaming sphere—in any case, I'd guess a greater number of non-gaming machines are still running Windows 10—that could be a big problem for users and Microsoft. So, unless you're planning to use your Windows 10 PC with an air gap, otherwise known as unplugging it from the internet and any other networks, you'd better take note of Microsoft's end-of-life timeline here.

However, Linux only saw a small 0.04% increase in the past month, so that's not exactly popping off. It's more likely we're just seeing the imperfect methods of the Steam Hardware Survey. The survey is far from a perfect representation of the userbase of Valve's platform—it's more akin to \"guidelines\" than actual data, to loosely quote Captain Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean.

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock.

In this, the US government wants Taiwan to move 50% of the chips it produces for US use to be made in the US. TSMC has fabs in America, newly-built ones with plans for more, but they don't make up anywhere near as much of global production as its facilities in Taiwan. This proposed deal would try to push for commitment to a huge increase in production on US soil.
