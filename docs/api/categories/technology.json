Google’s Android team spent a significant chunk of 2025 overhauling various system apps with the more modern Material 3 Expressive UI. One of the apps that received a refresh was Google Clock , which introduced extensive changes, including prominent fonts, larger buttons, and more vibrant background colors. But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely.

There’s no word if this will be an on-device AI feature or if it requires an internet connection. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 phones have a variety of Galaxy AI features , ranging from call transcripts and summaries to generative image editing and writing tools. Now, it looks like the Galaxy S26 series could receive another neat AI-based addition. Leaker Ahmed Qwaider claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 series could tell you when you’re in danger of double-booking yourself. More specifically, the phones will apparently detect when you’re arranging a meeting/appointment in WhatsApp, Instagram, or SMS and warn you via a notification if this appointment clashes with any events already in your calendar.",
