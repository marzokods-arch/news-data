For the unfamiliar, Troika is a very 'realheads know' sort of studio: Its games presaged the similarly buggy (and occasionally unfinished) early work by Obsidian, which was also founded by ex-Interplay devs. But, also like Obsidian, Troika's games were ambitious, imaginative, and unforgettable. They had strong word-of-mouth reputations on RPG forums, and all three of its games have received essential fan patches and laudatory reappraisals, with the Big Kahuna arguably being the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines . \"We had a lot of feature ideas, we did not edit ourselves at all, and we were a small team,\" Cain summarized at the beginning of the video. \"Every time Troika went to make a game, whether it was Arcanum, or Temple of Elemental Evil, or Bloodlines, there were just so many things we wanted to do.

To discover that it ditches the usual shortcomings of Samsung's QD-OLED tech while capitalising on all that characteristic OLED goodness, including perfect per-pixel lighting and incredible speed? Well, there's good reason to think that it might just be a goer. Because this new MSI monitor rocks Samsung's very latest QD-OLED panel technology . MSI is referring to it as \"5th-Gen\" Samsung QD-OLED, which is news to me. I thought the very latest panel tech from Samsung is Gen 4. Likewise, MSI refers to not only \"5th Gen\" but \"5th Gen Tandem OLED\" when describing this panel technology, which leaves me a bit baffled. \"Tandem OLED\" has hitherto been a marketing pitch employed by LG, Samsung's main competitor in the OLED panel manufacturing industry, to describe its own latest WOLED technology. Has someone in MSI marketing department gotten a little over excited when it comes to both the 5th-Gen and the tandem thing? Very possibly.

We're doing everything in shades of gray.

That's where Yes Man came in. If you haven't played New Vegas, Yes Man is a robot sporting a goofy grin and an inability to decline any command or truly be disposed of.

I'm not a huge fan art guy, but Deimos' work speaks to me—it reimagines this classic game through the lens of fine art, a style that emulates romantic painting, but applied to the side stories and characters of a 2010 RPG. 2281 Overture feels like a particularly illustrative example, showing an NCR-aligned version of the game's final battle with every companion ringed around the Courier (something you can't pull off in an unmodded game).

That's because the Consumer Electronics Show (or CES) is a grouping of some of the largest companies in the world, all trying to show off what they've got in the pipeline for the next year or so. Though AI is ever becoming the buzzword when it comes to major tech events like CES, that doesn't mean there won't also be some interesting hardware to grab your attention. After all, last year saw some excellent GPUs, need laptops, great handhelds, and even actual good uses of AI. Who knew? We know the likes of AMD and Nvidia both have keynote speeches during the week, alongside dozens of other companies, and we'll even have a few members of the PC Gamer team there on the ground floor to get their grubby mitts (and fingerprints) all over that lovely new tech. Before we even touch down in Las Vegas for the big event, we know quite a bit about what to expect and what technology we're expecting to see in 2026. Let's get into it then.

In last month's Steam hardware survey, the number of Linux users hit a new all-time high for the second month running, reaching the heady summit of a whopping, ah, 3.2% of overall Steam users. Hey, we're beating Mac players. I think that number will only grow as the new year goes by.

Depending on who you ask it may not even be Obsidian's best game this year—at least one PCG editor thinks it was Grounded 2 , and I almost couldn't choose between it and Avowed. It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions. Otherwise, KotOR 2, Mask of the Betrayer, New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, Tyranny, and Deadfire are all games that took years to achieve cult classic status, let alone the couple that have finally become universally acknowledged classics.

Subgenre trends happen all over gaming (the battle royale to extraction shooter pipeline, for instance) and cozy games are no exception. For a few years after Stardew Valley, absolutely everyone was making a farm sim. Then there was the influx of Townscaper-chasing cozy building games . This year it was the desktop idlers. (Image credit: Mister Morris Games, CaveLiquid, Moczan) They've got their roots back in the early 2000s when desktop pets were novelty applications that ran from your system tray in the bottom right. Back then, they were pretty minimal little apps that ran some simple animations and you could maybe have a couple interactions with. Desktop pets have completely evolved for their 2025 rebirth.

There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example.
