And, even as someone who has literally never sat atop a horse, I have no shame in admitting that I was the first to fall. However, if you haven't noticed your gaming library or day-to-day life becoming infected with these powerful beasts, it's probably because you haven't realised just how significant horses have been. Because I'm not talking about the games that are basically ranch simulators for the most part. Although they have had their time in the spotlight, with the full launch of The Ranch of Rivershine, Barbie Horse Trails, and Sound of Horses, it's more so a plethora of updates and expansions that have put a particular emphasis on horses, which has led me to believe that 2025 has been the y…",

Despite a lacklustre GPU generation and the RAMpocalypse , this year's PC gaming hardware has made me very happy. That's because 2025 has seen some meaningful, non-gimmicky leaps forward in competitive FPS gaming hardware. And no, I'm not talking about unreasonably high refresh rates on monitors—although the ones from Asus I saw at Gamescom did impress me, whether OLED or TN —I'm talking about peripherals. On the mouse front, we've had a big leap in how light a sturdy wireless gaming mouse can go with the 36 g Corsair Sabre V2 Pro . But then there's what a mouse sits atop: the humble mouse pad. I can't say I thought my years of testing and writing about PC gaming hardware would lead to writing so much about a mouse pad, but here we are: My favourite piece of 'hardware' from this year was a mouse pad. The pad in question, the SteelSeries QcK Performance , isn't just your run-of-the-mill mat, though. Hear me out.

That had been long on the cards , but it finally started seeming close at hand early on this year. SteamOS has shown what Linux can be capable of for gaming in large part because of Proton , the compatibility layer Valve employs to translate Windows commands into ones that Linux can understand. It's a fork of WINE tailored towards gaming, created and maintained by Valve specifically for that purpose. Over the years, Proton has gotten so good that compatible games tend to run flawlessly. Valve has an incentive to ensure this is the case, as a great gaming experience on SteamOS via Proton makes for more Steam Deck and Steam Store sales. The development and improvement of …",

Every new RPG is measured against it, and Larian's next game, Divinity, is still hotly anticipated even amid criticism of the studio's admission of experimenting with generative AI . Until Larian unveiled Divinity, we didn't know what it was doing next—only that it wouldn't be Baldur's Gate 4. At GDC 2024, about nine months after BG3's release, Larian boss Swen Vincke dropped a bombshell: The studio would not make an expansion pack or sequel to its most successful game to date, and was parting ways with Wizards of the Coast and D&D entirely. But they sure took their time saying goodbye, huh? Cyberpunk 2077 is the only recent singleplayer game I can think of that has received more free, post-launch additions⁠—and that was in response to a deeply compromised launch. Baldur's Gate 3 started on top, and just kept climbing. Before Vincke's early 2024 farewell, BG3 had already gotten the überhard, permadeath Honour Mode, as well as an expanded, playable epilogue.

It is, of course, official public information that Intel and Nvidia are collaborating on a generation of future APUs for PCs . So, the basic idea of such a chip is not a stretch. We just haven't had any details as to what that might actually mean. RedGamingtech describes Serpent Lake as an \"APU monster\" similar in remit to AMD's Strix Halo chip. It's said to sport Nvidia's next-gen Rubin GPU technology built on TSMC N3P silicon, while CPU tech from Intel's upcoming Titan Lake generation, more on which in a moment.

After a bit of semi-philosophical musing on the question of whether Shepard is alive following the events of Mass Effect 3 (spoiler: well, maybe ), Hale invited fans to \"email the powers-that-be who make these games and say, 'Give us more Shepard, please'.\" \"Because we will be there, because we should not go,\" Hale says. \"I would be there with bells on if they asked us to play Shepard again.\" \"I agree,\" Meer then chimes in with faux seriousness, \"but only under any circumstances.\" It could happen. BioWare made a point of offing Shepard at the start of Mass Effect 2 , and insisted that it was really for real—but then of course he was brought back to life by the Lazarus Project so he could save us all from the Reaper threat.

We're talking Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2, New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, Tyranny, and yes, even South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's an incredible list of games, and while some of them are looking a bit long in the tooth these days, I can't bring myself to not recommend every single one of them—and that's not just because PCG news writer Josh Wolens would curse me if I badmouthed Alpha Protocol. Since 2018, though? Things haven't been so great. (Image credit: Obsidian) The Outer Worlds and its sequel, along with Avowed, have plenty of defenders. They reviewed well— including here —and have their fans. But they're missing what made Obsidian's previous games so absurdly compelling: the best-in-class writing, the big risks and quests that stick with me years later.

Several times a week, if not every single day, I scan the news, press releases, and entertainment sites for any info about new game-related adaptations. So how the heck did I miss that there was a whole new live action Witcher movie. On Netflix. Starring Dolph Lundgren. And it came out in October of this year. It wasn't just me: a bunch of us at PC Gamer, movie fans and Witcher fans alike, missed it too. It's called The Rats: A Witcher Tale , a feature-length special that serves as a prequel to Season 4, and you can watch it right now on Netflix—though judging from evidence I'm about to present, I'm not sure Netflix really wants you to. Exhibit A: Netflix didn't do a heck of a lot to tell people about this movie. I get mail from Netflix in both my professional and personal inboxes, and they sent nothing about this special. Zilch. I also have an account on a Netflix press site that has absolutely zero mention of it. Odd. Weirder still, I searched the official YouTube channel and there's no trailer or even a teaser for it. That strikes me as especia…",

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Very rarely do I have the time or energy to play a new game more than once. Replays are usually something born from necessity, like work-related tasks, or my insatiable nostalgia for old RPGs. Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it. To be clear, that's two more times than I was asked to play for our South of Midnight review . I went at it a second time at my own leisure, then followed up again with a third replay so a friend could watch me, but I'll be damned if I didn't find some easy-to-miss, tiny detail with every press of 'new game' that made me fall in love with Hazel's journey through the American South all over again.

You don't need the impassioned argument about how Microsoft is the shameful poster child for just how contemptible an American megacorp can be in the year 2025. You don't need me to muster every bit of evidence I can find, because even if you don't remember each step in the bleak parade you can recall the shape of the march. Or maybe that's just the end-of-year fugue trying to convince me it's already past time I surrendered to the sugar coma and don't have to do any more work. Who can say? Either way, when you chalk up this many Ls in a single year, I don't think the passing shame of a single week's news cycle can do the whole picture justice. For as much criticism as Microsoft has gotten this year for closing game studios like Arkane, for pivoting Windows away from the kind of software that has a fun hot dog stand color scheme to a bloated whale carcass that even non-techies are considering ditching in favor of Linux, it deserves more.

The find was made by a new YouTube channel called Games' Past, and is two gigabytes larger than the release version of New Vegas and filled with cut or altered content that the team has been slowly teasing out. Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory. In the release version of Old World Blues there's a VR room that has been wrecked, and has no functionality. Here it works. Kinda.

Unfortunately it seems that it's very much here to stay, at least for the time being, as numerous industry figures have become far less subtle about taking advantage of it. That increased candor hasn't gone unnoticed, as Kodaka notes. \"Many game companies and creators have started openly talking about their use of AI,\" he mused in a post over on X , The Everything App. He reckons his latest game, The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy might indeed be the last defense against the rising tide of machine-based creations. \"At this rate, Hundred Line might truly become the last grand, 200-hour game story in human history written entirely without AI.\" Many game companies and creators have started openly talking about their use of AI.At this rate, Hundred Line might truly become the last grand, 200-hour game story in human history written entirely without AI. pic.twitter.com/AX9e2S8Hau December 20, 2025 As someone who is a bit of a self-professed g…",
