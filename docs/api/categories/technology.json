As reported by WMAR 2 News , multiple police cars showed up to a high school in Baltimore County, Maryland, to apprehend a student who AI flagged as having a gun (bodycam footage from ABC 7 Chicago ). All students on the premises at 7:23 PM were checked by the police officers, and no gun was found. It wasn't until three minutes after apprehending the students that the police officers spotted a blue bag of Doritos in the bin, and put together what had gone wrong. The Omnilert AI gun detection system, which monitors the school's cameras, alerted the school that a gun may be on the grounds, and the authorities were informed as a result. In an attempt to explain what had happened to the students, an officer says, \"I guess just the way you guys were eating chips… Doritos or whatever, it picked it up as a gun.\" After the problem was resolved and the cul…",

The Outer Worlds 2, despite getting a solid thumbs up by resident RPG sicko Ted Litchfield in his review , is no exception. See, the $100 premium edition of the game gives you access to Obsidian's latest five whole days early. Also, to be fair, a few bonuses that are technically worth the price—two future DLCs, access to the artbook and soundtrack, and a couple of bundles with armours and weapons in them. Standard stuff. Oh, and also the privilege of Obsidian sticking its tongue out at you and going ner-ner. See, in The Outer Worlds 2, you can pick up optional \"Flaws\". These are typically curse/kiss debuffs with a slight upside, forcing you to play around them—and they're typically triggered by certain in-game events.

The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case.

If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise. The cycle continues. This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.

We tend to find gaming chair deals popping up throughout November and, to a lesser degree, continuining through December. There are even some on right now, if you'd care to scroll down for a look. 👉 Our top early Black Friday PC gaming deals 👈 The things we look for in a gaming chair are comfort, ergonomics, durability, value and looks. Mostly in that order. We review gaming chairs throughout the year, which informs the deals we highlight. That experience really matters with gaming chairs. There is a lot of trash out there—many super-cheap chairs to sift through at some retailers. If a deal looks too good to be true, it usually is. When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday is on November 28, 2025 . This marks the day when most retailers will drop prices to their lowest point. Though we've been covering Black Friday deals for a long time now, and we've noticed a trend among retailers to try to 'get ahead' of the competition with early discounts. When this happens, it can be a good idea to check if a retailer offers a price guarantee that ensures th…",

The most popular machines sport the RTX 5060 or RTX 5070, and while there are higher-end models, they're not great value for money. Don't forget to consider how much RAM and storage are included with a gaming laptop. Lots of companies save cash by skimping in these areas, and we prefer gaming laptops to come with at least 16 GB of dual-channel memory and a 1 TB SSD, but sometimes a really good deal on something with less cannot be ignored.

Players are clearly itching for more, as evidenced by new kid on the block RV There Yet? 's rapid rise to 100,000 concurrent players. It's just started to dip as I write this, according to SteamDB . PC Gamer features producer Mollie Taylor was among that player count earlier this week, and in her impressions said \"things are a little janky right now\" but \"the whole thing is darn fun.\" It's a physics-based adventure game where a bunch of pudgy dads haul a camper through perilous crags with a remote-operated winch, avoid getting eaten by bears, and exhale enough cigarette smoke to conceal a marching army. It's released to warm reception on Steam, with user reviews stabilizing at a \"Very Positive\" rating. The store page's top-rated review , by user LeGrandOptimist, reads \"Fix RV. Smoke cig. Get mauled. Peak gaming.\" Another review by Steam user Bulldoge noted \"Great game, especially the part where I c…",

The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers. DNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans…",

The studios' 4X and grand strategy games in particular tend to have very long lives supplemented by constant infusions of paid DLC, ranging from piecemeal addons to full-on expansions. It doesn't always go to plan , and the execution was particularly spotty with Europa Universalis 4, but EU5 lead Johan Andersson reckons the problem isn't Paradox's DLC strategy. In fact, it's been \"pretty fucking great.\" In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson said the DLC model has been a logistical and financial win. \"When we started with that system, we were a studio of 12 people. That's [around the time Crusader Kings 2 released] and we're doing EU4. I have no idea how big PDS Stockholm is—300, 400 500 people—I have no idea about Stockholm these days. \"We have multiple pipelines on games that are keeping them alive, so I'd say it's a pretty great system, at least if you're looking at success.\" While the company has met with numerous hitches in the last several years, it is a much bigger publisher than it used to be, with five internal development teams to its name.
