    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually Google backed down, and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Changes are coming to how Android users install apps outside the safety and protection of the Play Store. Google sounded the alarm last summer, warning the Android community that starting in 2026, even developers releasing apps for sideloading would have to register with Google . Following some immediate pushback, Google softened its stance a bit, ultimately agreeing to give informed users the option for an “advanced” installation flow that would support even unverified apps. And as we wait to see exactly how that’s going to work, we’re starting to spot some early pieces of it.

The shift formalizes a partnership that has shaped GMR’s direction for years, with the company emphasizing that the move reflects continuity rather than a change in strategy. Toig, who joined GMR in 2018 as chief business officer, has overseen the organization&#8217;s revenue strategy, licensing operations and commercial partnerships during a period of expansion. As CEO, he&#8217;ll lead the company&#8217;s day-to-day operations and guide its relationships with licensees, songwriters and industry partners. Grimmett — who launched GMR with Irving Azoff in 2013 — will remain central to long-term planning while continuing to work directly with the company’s roster. “Randy and Jeff have been working side by side for a long time, building GMR into what it is today,” said Azoff. “This is a natural evolution for GMR which allows us to continue to set the industry standard for excellence and transparency for the world’s best songwriters and the folks who want to perform their incredible songs.” Related Pete An…",

Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",

Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

This year, that moment came courtesy of Razer and its latest experiment in AI companionship, Project Ava. It’s an AI-powered gaming assistant designed to sit on your desk, analyze what’s happening on-screen, and offer real-time advice. It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device. But it’s your opinion we care most about, so we put a poll in Joe’s article asking if you’d consider buying Project Ava.",

The option was replaced by buttons with Clock’s Material 3 Expressive redesign. In addition to testing this change, Google is also bringing two minor tweaks to Clock with the latest update. Google’s Android team spent a significant chunk of 2025 overhauling various system apps with the more modern Material 3 Expressive UI. One of the apps that received a refresh was Google Clock , which introduced extensive changes, including prominent fonts, larger buttons, and more vibrant background colors. But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

The idea replaces heavy use of glue with a reinforced battery assembly that locks into the device frame. While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

    "summary": "Unlocking Galaxy phones just got a lot more interesting in One UI 8.5.",
    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A new LockStar update introduces dynamic transition effects in One UI 8.5, replacing the standard static unlock. You get granular control over the animations, allowing you to tweak the speed, direction, distortion, and even the physics of the movement. You can also override the system’s auto-brightness for the Always On Display as part of the update. For all the power packed into our Galaxy phones, the act of unlocking them has felt pretty utilitarian for a while. You tap, the screen turns on, and that’s it. It works, but it’s not very exciting, except for the new fingerprint unlocking animations that arrived last year. If you’re using the latest One UI 8.5 beta, though, that quick moment is about to get a lot more interesting. Samsung has released a quiet update to its LockStar module. As per a post on X by tipster Ice Universe, the latest version (8.5.00.8) brings fully customizable unlock animations, meaning you now have several transition effects that make unlocking your phone feel smooth and intentional.",

The phones could detect when you’re arranging a meeting in a messaging app and warn you if this clashes with calendar events. There’s no word if this will be an on-device AI feature or if it requires an internet connection. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 phones have a variety of Galaxy AI features , ranging from call transcripts and summaries to generative image editing and writing tools. Now, it looks like the Galaxy S26 series could receive another neat AI-based addition. Leaker Ahmed Qwaider claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 series could tell you when you’re in danger of double-booking yourself. More specifically, the phones will apparently detect when you’re arranging a meeting/appointment in WhatsApp, Instagram, or SMS and warn you via a notification if this appointment clashes with any events already in your calendar.",
