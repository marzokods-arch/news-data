We often hear how many total quests are in a game— Skyrim has 273—but how much variety is there really? Fallout co-creator Tim Cain explains the nine core types of missions you can be given, and, to my surprise, kill and murder are two separate categories. If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

While the former is faster and more robust, the latter offers considerably more storage, making it ideal for housing terabyte-hungry games. And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

There are two models, only 2,000 will be made, and they will set you back a cool $1,475 for Grace's watch, and $2,175 for Leon's watch. Hamilton's descriptions of the watches are really something, the kind of thing only a very bored person who has nothing to do but sell watches would come up with. \"Grace wears a unique American Classic Pan Europ that blends strength and sophistication with a gold-accented strap, geometric case-back motifs, and a bold gold-and-black dial.\" Bold!

This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems.

Or maybe those will just be modifiers applied to existing maps, but Watkins' main point is that Embark isn't interested in adding maps just to have new places to do the same old thing. \"The ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot avai…",

Comments on YouTube accusing the trailer of being made with generative AI began flowing almost immediately after it was posted. Some called out specific characters who look AI generated; quite a few others made the point that SNK is backed by serious money now and shouldn't be looking to cut corners with gen AI. SNK was effectively acquired in 2022 by Saudi Arabia's Electronic Gaming Development Company , a division of the Mohammed bin Salman Foundation. Bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia (and credibly accused murderer ), is the prime mover behind the $55 billion buyout of Electronic Arts.

The costume follows the upcoming Tomb Raider remake , Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, in straightforwardly recreating Lara's classic '90s look, with the minor tweak that her shorts are black rather than brown. Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it. (In saying that, I do have to exclude X's substantial population of massive losers, who have taken to complaining about the actor's proportions and using Grok to alter the photo in replies to the official Tomb Raider account .

Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs.

Michael Kirkbride, who worked alongside Kuhlmann on Morrowind and Oblivion, wrote at the time that \"Kurt was the best writer that TES ever had… his leaving will be to the creative detriment of [The Elder Scrolls] 6.\" \"It was almost certainly time for a change,\" Kuhlmann, who now works at the Tencent-owned studio Lightspeed LA, tells me. \"There were some things that had been going on for a long time that I'd not been super happy with.\" (Image credit: Bethesda) Some were an inevitable result of Bethesda's boom years: with hundreds of developers across multiple studios making Starfield, communication sometimes broke down and developers felt disconnected from senior management, Kuhlmann says. But there's another reason—and it's linked to a promise Todd Howard made to him about The Elder Scrolls 6. A promise, he says, that was never fulfilled. It was almost certainly time for a change. Kurt Kuhlmann Kuhlmann's tenure at Bethesda was split in two. As a junior designer in…",

They claim to have first noticed the performance improvements when swapping between a friend's account with all the DLC enabled and their own, and noticing that the game ran significantly better on the former. According to de_Tylmarande, their mod doesn't actually unlock any of the DLC, but instead skips the check confirming it is present, subverting a system-heavy process and leading to a major frame rate boost. MH Wilds - Bad performance mystery (Solved?) from r/MonsterHunter \"The more DLC you own, the better performance you get in the game\", claims the redditor. \"On the account with no DLC I get heavy and stable FPS drops down to like 20-25 in hubs, while on the account with all DLC bought its 80+ FPS.\" To test out this DLC-boosting theory, I performed some benchmarking runs of my own, both on a fresh, DLC-less copy of the game, and one with all 189 (!) …",

One of the hurdles lies in dungeon \"routing\". Because Mythic+ dungeons are all on a timer, and because WoW's dungeons tend to be a little more open-plan than something you'd get in, say, Final Fantasy 14, every single dungeon has a bespoke route filled with little tricks. And because this is Mythic+, you are expected to know them immediately, lest you be deemed a n00b, or something far ruder, which I won't publish on this website. Well, Blizzard's tinkering with a solution. On the Midnight beta test servers, the studio's introduced a new \"affix\"—basically a modifier—to Mythic+ levels 2-5.

Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

And outside of this paid update, one of the original Monster Train's clans is also being added to Monster Train 2 for free. No price has yet been announced for the DLC. I spoke with Mark Cooke, founder and CEO of Shiny Shoe about Destiny of the Railforged, how this ambitious new mode works, and what mechanics the new clan brings to bear. The new mode, Soul Savior Monster Train 2 takes place in heaven, but the new mode, Soul Savior, plays out in a spacey, ethereal realm called the Soulstream, where you fight to reclaim souls from a final boss called the Lifemother. The mode isn't a novelty side attraction, but a fresh way of playing Monster Train 2 that the studio wants to be equal in depth and complexity to the main game.
