Hudson is responsible for directing some of the most popular sci-fi RPGs ever made, including the very popular Mass Effect series, during his tenure at BioWare.

Okay, so that's a very rough description of the work conducted by MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Waterloo, and Samsung Electronics. But when you read the details about it in the press release on the matter, you'll see that it's a tad difficult to describe it all in just one sentence. Traditional CMOS chips are fabricated by applying and then etching repeated layers of different materials, applied to a wafer of ultra-pure silicon. The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM). However, these need to be fed a current in order to work, plus you need to be able to read and write data to groups of transistors that form lo…",

Last week I was: Recommending you go be cringe in World of Warcraft . It is 2019: Larian is announcing its new RPG , Baldur's Gate 3 . The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

    "body": "Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve was announced at The Game Awards today, and I know at least a couple people who are probably vibrating. If you're wondering what the heck a \"Theve\" is, it's the capital of The Federation of Central Usea (obviously). The dogfighting game is set in 2029, and casts you as \"a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard.\" According to Bandai Namco, Wings of Theve will feature a campaign that \"puts players in the role of an ace pilot in an emotionally charged story of identity and duty, fighting for the survival of their homeland\" as well as multiplayer modes. Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve will release on Steam in 2026, and of course PlayStation and Xbox consoles.",

    "body": "As I write this, we're roughly two hours into tonight's Game Awards. There have been some major reveals: After two decades, there'll be a proper return to The Old Republic . We now know that Larian was behind Keighley's special desert statue . There will be two Tomb Raiders in the next two years. That's all fine. I like a world premiere as much as anyone. But the best of those reveals is a distant second in the running for The Game Awards' best moment, because in the middle of the show, Werner Herzog appeared to explain Warframe to the crowd. If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant. Warframe is magnificently, beautif…",

    "body": "When Swedish developer Neon Giant got in touch earlier this year to tease its next game, I took the call because of how much we liked its first game, a top-down action RPG whose setting we called \"cooler than Night City\" in 2021. Now we've had our first proper look at the studio's ambitious sophomore outing, which was revealed today at The Game Awards: It's called No Law, and it's a singleplayer FPS set in a cyberpunk city ruled by gangs that, from the looks of it, we're going to dismantle violently. I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer. The gameplay we see in the video reminds me of Bulletstorm—big kicks, exploding heads, lots of shooting—but we also spy some sneaky assassinations, so it isn't entirely about blowing stuff up. The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis promises a \"stunning re-imagining\" of Lara Croft's first adventure from nearly 30 years ago, with updates graphics and gameplay, and \"new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.\" Narratively at least, the remake seems to be treated as sort of a recollection of years past, which presumably opens the door to previously unseen events and action. The announcement also finally gives us our first live look at the \"Unified Lara\" character design revealed in early 2024, a blend of the OG and her more modern look, last seen in 2018. This will be the second remake of the original Tomb Raider, following the serviceable but largely unremarkable Tomb Raider: Anniversary . But that was 18 years ago, and I'd say that's more than enough time passed to allow for a new shot at it. The bigger deal, though, is Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Set in northern India, Catalyst follows Lara on an all-new adventure that takes place in the aftermath of a \"…",

So we probably shouldn't be surprised to discover that its new Control sequel, announced at The Game Awards tonight, swerves on pretty much everything you'd think would carry over from the first game. To break it down: It's not a third-person shooter—it's a melee-focused \"action-RPG\". It's not set in the Oldest House, but instead an open world New York. It doesn't star Jesse Faden—you play as her brother, Dylan, who was the first game's villain. Perhaps appropriate, then, that it's not called Control 2—it's Control Resonant—though it does seem to follow on from the events of the first game. Dylan, seemingly now free of the influence of the Hiss, has been deployed by the FBC to combat a new supernatural disaster—namely, reality-warping forces that have spilled out of the Oldest House and into the outside world, twisting an entire city into new forms. Where Jesse wielded the Service Weapon, able to transform into a variety of different guns, Dylan instead has the Aberrant, an artifact that frankly looks like a cursed crowbar. It too can shapeshift, but into a selection of melee weapons, including an enormous…",
