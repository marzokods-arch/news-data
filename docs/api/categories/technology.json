The top simulation is without strakes while the bottom shows the airflow with strakes. The green and yellow colors on the rocket’s surface show how the airflow scrapes against the rocket’s skin. The white and gray areas show changes in air density between the boosters and core stage, with the brightest regions marking shock waves.

A few years ago, taking an Android phone into an area without cell service meant you were completely cut off — unable to text friends, family, or even emergency services. Today, however, you wouldn’t be so disconnected thanks to satellite connectivity , a feature that links your phone directly to satellites orbiting Earth. Google introduced platform support for satellite connectivity in last year’s Android release, though the feature was initially limited to emergency messaging. The technology has advanced significantly since then, however, paving the way for features like WhatsApp calling and live location sharing even without cellular coverage.",

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage. Now it seems Verizon is making a deal of its own , committing to the use of over 4,400 new towers in the deal. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Several of these are the kind of gifts that still make sense even if the recipient already owns something similar, such as a smart light or a useful accessory they didn’t realize they needed. They’re practical, a little bit fun, and easy to slot into everyday life. And yes, a few of them would also make perfectly reasonable “accidental” gifts to yourself.",

The tablet is priced at $399.99 in the US, with pre-orders open now and general sales starting December 26, 2025. Alongside the OnePlus 15R , OnePlus is also refreshing its budget Android tablet offering with the new OnePlus Pad Go 2 , which features a larger display, a newer processor, additional software updates, and more.

New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",

My love for all things E-Ink is well documented, and for years I’ve wanted a device that can combine the benefits of E-Ink with the versatility of a full-fledged tablet . I want a single device that can swap out my paperback, take notes as responsively as an old-school notepad, and handle a modern digital workflow without breaking a sweat. It sounds simple enough. We’ve had E-Ink readers for years, and we have had tablets for even longer. The logical endpoint, the holy grail, would be a fast and fluid color E-Ink reader. Imagine a screen that can render comic books in full color, handle highlighting for PDFs, and manage color-coded calendars, all while giving me the benefits of all-out sunlight readability and battery life. Sounds perfect to me. I’ve spent years chasing a device that can merge the magic of E-Ink with the flexibility of a real tablet. On paper, the Boox Note Air 5C is exactly that device.

Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.

The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

From what we can tell, this marks the first publicly acknowledged update for the earbuds in quite some time. According to a post on the Pixel Buds Pro Help Forum , firmware version 5.11 is now becoming available. Google says the update focuses on bug fixes, performance improvements, and security updates, but doesn’t share any specific details beyond that.",

Out of the six image pairs, I was surprised to learn that more than half of our readers got at least four right, with 20 percent not making a single mistake. But can this result be repeated in 2025? A lot has changed in a year, with AI generation tools making a big leap forward. Nano Banana Pro is a lot better than Imagen 4 used in my post last year, as it has the ability to create more realistic images, ditching things like super smooth skin and that perfect bokeh effect in some cases. The tool also allows me to make minor changes to specific parts of an image, which was impossible a year ago, since Gemini just created a brand new image when I asked for a change.",

The convenience of having an all-knowing research assistant available at the tap of a button has its appeal, and for a long time, I didn’t care much about the ramifications of using AI. Fast forward to today, and it’s a whole different world. There’s no getting around the fact that you are feeding an immense amount of deeply personal information, from journal entries to sensitive work emails, into a black box owned by trillion-dollar corporations. What could go wrong? Now, there’s no going back from AI, but there are use cases for it where it can work as a productivity multiplier. And that’s why I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of researching local AI . If you’re not familiar with the concept, it’s actually fairly simple. It is entirely possible to run a large language model, the brains behind a tool like ChatGPT, right off your computer or even a phone. Of course, it won’t be as capable or all-knowing as ChatGPT, but depending on your use case, it might still be effective enough. Better still, no data leaves your device, nor is there a monthly subscription fee to consider. But if you’re concerned that pulling thi…",
