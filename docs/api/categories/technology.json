    "body": "Later this month, Volvo will unveil its new EX60 SUV. The Swedish automaker has adopted some of the latest trends in electric vehicle design for the EX60, like a structural battery pack and the use of very large castings. As always with automakers teasing a new car, concrete details are only emerging slowly ahead of the official reveal on January 21, but we can say that range and recharging speeds were a priority during the design process. \"With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety,\" said Anders Bell, Volvo's CTO. Volvo says that its SUV will be best-in-class for range, which means 400 miles (644 km) from a fully charged battery under the EPA test cycle (although an official EPA range number isn't due yet). Fast charging should also live up to the name. Providing you plug into a 400 kW DC fast charger, the EX60 should add 168 miles (270 km) of range in 10 minutes, although we don't know how long it requires to fast charge from 10–80 percent.

A marketing video also portrayed the robot controlling smart home devices, including activating a smart vacuum when someone made a mess. Ballie rolled back onto the trade show scene at CES 2024. This time, it had a new, more spherical and larger build rolling upon its three wheels. Ballie also sported a light ring, and Samsung showed a video of the robot being used as a projector.

At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi). After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.

And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well. A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn't exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago . When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games. Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS's footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the origin…",

Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is. A whistleblower reportedly alerted the Nuclear Regulation Authority in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data. Based on an English translation , it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different u…",

    "summary": "Rather than being used as a storage material, the sulfur gives up electrons.",
    "body": "Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That's mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market. But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur's complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials. Sulfur chemistry Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that's not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin …",

A team of anthropologists recently examined a collection of fossil hominin jawbones, teeth, and vertebrae that belong to hominins who probably lived very close in time to our species’ last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans. They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history. From predators’ quarry to rock quarry Archaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Motorola is no stranger to foldables, having revived the Razr as a flip-style foldable phone in 2020. Now that it has a few iterations of modern flip phones under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Google's Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside. Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it's far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won't confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time. What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables. Read full article Comments",
