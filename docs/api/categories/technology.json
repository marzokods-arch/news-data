At their best, they set the tone perfectly. At their worst, their forced action hero coolness can inch over into cringe. Across the breadth of the now 16 year old series, in spin-offs, sequels, and pre-sequels, we've seen the full spectrum.

We'll start with the worst, and work our way up to the best, using the most rigorous of decision-making criteria. Disagree with my picks? Let me know in the comments.

Fonseca explains how he \"built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.\" The villagers are central to the game and their dialogue is what makes it so special, so how does AI add anything to the already charming world? From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

    "body": "The indie studio that took on the might of Monster Energy , and won, is having the hit game at the center of the dispute adapted into a movie. Deadline reports that Glowstick Entertainment has inked a deal for its survival horror game Dark Deception to be adapted into a feature film by indie production outfit So It Goes Entertainment. Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).
