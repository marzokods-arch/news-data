Doing this gets you the Aviator outfit (that one with the headphones), so it's well worth the time. In this quest, Celeste asks you to head to the Formicai Outpost on Dam Battlegrounds to do your flag waving. Finding the flag is pretty straightforward, but you might be struggling with where to hoist it. Either way, I'll run through the whole A Symbol of Unification quest below. Since you're not extracting anything, it might be worth bringing a free loadout , especially as the trek to Formicai can be quite long if you get an inconvenient spawn.

Europe's second supercomputer to date, the Alice Recoque will be built with next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs, codenamed \"Venice,\" and AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs.

Eviden then covers networking, connecting AMD's components via its BullSequana XH3500 platform. The whole thing is being touted as an 'AI factory'. The hope is that all of this cutting-edge tech will mean France's first supercomputer will be capable of delivering \"more than one exaflop of HPL performance\" upon completion. HPL here refers to 'High-Performance Linpack', which is a type of benchmark to test serious processing power, such as what the Alice Recoque will eventually possess.

You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype. For the most part, the evidence in support of an announcement happening today seems to be: Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx on November 18, 2019 Today is also November 18 Half-Life 1 released on November 19, which is also a date in November Half-Life 2 released on November 16, and that, too, is a date in November Geoff Keighley posted a 👀 emoji Don't cancel your dinner plans, in other words.

But, according to Ubisoft, that hasn't stopped the city builder from breaking a few records. Anno 117: Pax Romana is \"the fastest-selling title in the franchise’s 25-year history,\" Ubisoft said in an email to PC Gamer. Ubisoft also said that with an average of 85 on Metacritic (PC Gamer's Anno 117: Pax Romana review scores it an 80) and a 94% \"Recommended\" on OpenCritic (with an average score of 84), Anno 117 has become \"the highest-rated Anno in the franchise's history.\" Steam reviewers haven't been as generous. Amid scattered complaints of bugginess, a shortened campaign, and connection issues with its co-op mode, one user summed it up with the most damning sort of praise a game can get: \"Anno is fine.\" Most of the negative reviews are focused on how unhappy players are that AI assets have been used in the game.

Ouch. Honest mistake, though, and to Valve's credit it offered developer Permadeath a small makeup: an opportunity to spotlight Planet Centauri as one of Steam's Daily Deals, \"as a way to help make up for lost visibility.\" The studio has since moved on to other things, because there really wasn't any choice in the matter, but despite some misgivings it did eventually decide to take Valve up on the offer. So, as reported by Polygon , a little over a month ago Permadeath signed up for the Daily Deal spotlight on one of the dates offered by Valve: November 12. November 12, as it turned out, was a very big day—but not for Planet Centauri. Because November 12 was the day Valve revealed the Steam Machine , Steam Frame , and Steam Controller to the world, a move that completely dominated the videogaming news scene for days and b…",

Instead, Cain said we should hearken back to games from the '80s, when he started working in the games industry as a teen. Computer hardware in the '80s was, obviously, less capable. And crucially, Cain said, there were no shared hardware and software standards, even as \"games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles.\" Game…",

It's reached the point where even developer Larian Studios seems a little baffled by the whole thing. A quick recap: Baldur's Gate 3 ran the board on Game of the Year Awards in 2023, taking the big crown (and numerous other laurels) in the Steam Awards, The Game Awards, and the Golden Joysticks. It then continued to rumble in 2024, taking five trophies including Best Game and the Player's Choice awards at the 2024 BAFTAs and four more—including, again, Game of the Year—at the Gayming Awards. It got to the point where Larian boss Swen Vincke was almost asking the world to please stop giving us awards , because the seemingly endless stream of accolades meant the development team \"can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.\" And then a month after that Baldur's Gate 3 won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work, because sure, why not. But now it's 2025 and surely Larian must be due for a break,…",

The asset in question is a 3D model of plastic explosive that appears in the new trailer. Recognising the asset, McFarlane took to social media to address the issue: \"Hey Delta Force, thank you for being huge Rust fans. Please remove our assets,\" McFarlane posted on X (via Insider Gaming ). \"If you wanted to collab, you should have reached out.\" In a follow-up post, McFarlane linked to an ArtStation page showing the asset, which he says was made \"fully in-house\" by Facepunch's lead weapon and prop artist Thomas Butters, who also goes by Pilgrim. It looks virtually identical to the asset seen in the trailer, though this doesn't necessarily mean it is the same asset.

This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\". Ingold revealed the full story in an interview with Eurogamer , explaining how Inkle was approached by multiple organisations about working with their licenses following the success of 80 Days . \"One of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on.
