Bungie had already teased that we'd have one more test drive, and it just reiterated that promise, explaining, \"We'll have an open preview weekend before launch, and everyone will be able to try Marathon out\". No date has been revealed yet, however. Yes. We'll have an open preview weekend before launch, and everyone will be able to try Marathon out! January 19, 2026 The big public closed alpha last year ran for a very generous week and a half, from April 23 until May 4, and other closed tests later in the year lasted a similar length.

I'd argue at school with mates about who would win in a fight between Mario and Sonic (Sonic would absolutely destroy him), extol the virtues of Streets of Rage 2, and insist that the Saturn would smash N64 and PlayStation (oops). Fast-forward to my young adulthood and suddenly the Sega of old was no more, and watching games like Shenmue 2 release on Xbox felt oddly like betrayal. But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox. I fell in love with Halo and would go head-over-heels for Halo 2, and lived for years with a magazine poster for Halo 3 behind my television with that magical promise: \"Finish the fight.\" I did do other things, I promise, but I spent an awful lot of time with the Master Chief, and Xbox and Halo became synonymous in my mind with peak console gaming. Halo has fallen a long way since those heady times. Microsoft has never really been able to replace Bungie, and of course …",

The main difference is that the Sym is symmetrical and the Ergo is reportedly ergonomic. Be Quiet! says the Ergo is \"intuitively easy to grip\", but we'll need to go hands-on with it to feel how true that is. Be Quiet! CEO Aaron Licht says, \"Our move into gaming mice had one goal: to deliver an extremely lightweight mouse that helps users compete at the highest levels of the leaderboards.\" On the internals, Be Quiet! shares that both mice have optical Omron D2FP-FN2 switches and a PixArt PAW3950 sensor. They can also be configured using a web-based app for Windows, iOS, and even Linux (via Chromium-based browsers) without the need for any software. This is a neat touch. Both the Ergo and Sym will be available from February 3 with a suggested retail price of $110. We do like plenty of Be Quiet! products: We declared the Light Mount the best gaming keyboard of 20…",

I feel stodgy and static without them. The argument for vaulting them, as laid out by Epic's design director Ted Timmins , is that Fortnite had a \"combat fleeing issue\" that spoiled fights. \"If we are being honest with ourselves,\" he said, \"as much as we all love shockwaves, is it actually skilful to just throw one at your feet and immediately be able to escape an engagement?\" This echoes some but not all of the arguments made by streamer NickEh30 in December . He too said that shockwaves made escaping fights too easy—but added they also negate high-ground advantage, ruin early rotations, and outclass all other mobility items. Fans wondered whether NickEh30's prompted Epic's move, but Timmins denied that in his post. I and most users on the game's subreddit disagree with the decision to vault shockwaves—I'll explain why in a minute—but I do sympathize with both Timmins and NichEh30. Shockwaves can be a crutch.

While it's much more subtle and nebulous than these changes, Bungie has also claimed it's \"doubling down on the dark, gritty, and grounded sci-fi world\" through an updated visual style, \"deepened environmental storytelling\", and the narrative-tracking Codex. This focus on narrative and world in an extraction shooter is rather hard to understand without seeing it in action.

The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

Massive in terms of ambition and scale, overflowing with checked open-world RPG boxes, crafted by a talented team who put years and years of work into it—so why is it a cautionary tale instead of an astronomical success? According to Kurt Kuhlmann, Bethesda's former Elder Scrolls loremaster and the co-lead designer on Skyrim, \"the main problem with Starfield is it didn't fully cohere as a game\". Kuhlmann left Bethesda in 2023, around the time of Starfield's launch, so he was there throughout development and thus was present for a lot of changes in regards to how Bethesda worked and how staff communicated. When he was working on Skyrim, itself a massive endeavour, things were simpler. \"I was working directly on the game, and I was a lead,\" he says. \"That was how all the leads worked then, and so I was directly working with all the people, all the quest designers, myself.\" But from Skyrim on, that started to change, and it was \"one of the main things\" that Kuhlmann \"didn't like\". By the time Starfield came around, \"Todd [Howard] was still the creative director,\" Kuhlma…",

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts. As the name suggests, activating this tool essentially links the edges of multiple displays together, so as you pop off the edge of one monitor, the mouse cursor should seamlessly appear on the opposing edge of the next display. I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle. With Cursor Wrap, that's no longer an issue, and you'll find that your mouse can now zip vertically through displays with ease. It does the same thing even if you only have one screen, linking the opposing edges into a uni…",

According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry. To pass that opportunity up only to launch a month or two later? That's a bit odd. Of course, the tech industry is currently in flux thanks to the ongoing RAMpocolypse . So that could be a factor.

At the very least, Chmielarz is talking from a place of comparison with Witchfire's similarly-sized team of just under 30 devs—he's cognisant of the above quibble, stating later in the interview \"we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing\".

Last week while trying to find traces of an internet forum I remembered from my teens, I typed in the site's slogan—\"Grimmest and Most Frostbitten Kvlt of Fool's Gold\"—which Google's AI overview spun up a completely nonsense answer for: \"The grimmest, most frostbitten \"kvlt\" (cult) of fool's gold is Iron Pyrite (FeS 2 ).\" Google further explained that the \"'Kvlt aspect\" was due to fool's gold being \"often considered more valuable than real gold in the fictional universe of Azeroth (World of Warcraft).\" Whatever, man. The other most obnoxious trait of Google's AI search results is that when it does actually recognize what you're referencing, it will source a bunch of random information, assemble it into what looks like a factual overview, and still be completely wrong. Case in point: Author Chuck Wendig does not have a pet cat, but that didn't stop Google's AI overview from citing a blog in which he jokes about a cat named Sir Mewling…",

    "body": "Survival MMO Dune: Awakening has just been patched to version 1.2.40.0, introducing a feature every sleeper has been waiting for: character transfers. You're no longer tied down to the server you created your character on. You can pack up your things and find a new home—just make sure you pack all your things. \"You can now transfer your character, inventory, backed-up bases and vehicles, and bank contents (including your Solari) to a new Sietch and World,\" Funcom announced today . Transfers require a token, which every player has been given, and that token will replenish a week after using it. In other words, you'll get one server transfer per week. Players have been clambering for server transfers for a while now: for some it's because the world they started playing on no longer has enough players and feels like a ghost town, or because one particular faction is dominating the Landsraad, or because their friends have moved onto other games and they're looking for some new blood. It's taken quite a while for this feature to arrive—Dune: Awakening launched way back in June 2025—but it's great that it's finally here. If you're ready to hop to a new Dune, you can transfer your charac…",

This has also been the source of multiple lawsuits, claiming that the companies performing the training had no right to freely use the data. In an expanded class-action case against Nvidia, however, the accusation goes one step further, with claims that the GPU giant willingly used an illegal source of pirated books to train its models. As reported by TorrentFreak , an amended complaint (pdf warning) filed at the district court in Oakland, California last week, specifically claims that staff at Nvidia contacted a so-called 'shadow library' known as Anna's Archive, a repository of pirated books and other documents. The plaintiffs cite internal Nvidia communications as evidence, with the filed document purporting to show someone from the data strategy team at Nvidia writing, \"we are exploring including Anna's Archive in pre-training data for our LLMs.\" It continues with \"We are figuring out internally whether we are willing to accept the risk of using this data, but would like to speak with your team to get a better understanding of LLM-related work yo…",

    "body": "A new Arc Raiders update has been released , fixing two exploits as well as targeting the Stella Montis \"out of bounds\" glitch, which enables players to stand outside of the map and shoot inwards. It's pretty careful with how it talks about the latter, however, saying that \"various out of bounds map locations\" on Stella Montis have been fixed. Rather than, say, all of them. The two duplication exploits relate to items and ammo, and basically were one of those where you dropped something and then picked it up in a particular manner to get dupes. Both of these have been fixed. Embark Studios has also \"fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry\", which doesn't sound like it was too pleasant. Then there's the Stella Montis kinda-fix, which is an issue that's been hanging around in the game for a couple months: players anecdotally report that Embark has been replacing items for players particularly caught-out by this, though it's an open question whether certain spots persist for ne'er-do-wells to take advantage of.

The Ayaneo Konkr Fit is the company's upcoming Windows handheld gaming PC. It comes loaded with the AI 9 HX 470, which was only recently announced. With four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5c cores, and clocking in at a max boost clock of 5.2 GHz, it's a pretty powerful chip. Previously, Ayaneo's Konkr range has relied on Snapdragon chips, namely the G3 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. This is a step above the Android-based OS of the Snapdragon Pocket Fit . Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display. They look nearly identical but the Windows model is clearly much larger when viewed side-by-side. We've liked Ayaneo devices …",
