The threat group making the demands began their campaign in May, when they made voice calls to organizations storing data on the Salesforce platform, Google-owned Mandiant said in June. The English-speaking callers would provide a pretense that necessitated the target connect an attacker-controlled app to their Salesforce portal. Amazingly—but not surprisingly—many of the people who received the calls complied. It’s becoming a real mess The threat group behind the campaign is calling itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, a mashup of three prolific data-extortion actors: Scattered Spider, LAPSuS$, and ShinyHunters. Mandiant, meanwhile, tracks the group as UNC6040, because the researchers so far have been unable to positively identify the connections. Read full article Comments",

For example, people could set their Pop buttons to launch Philips Hue or Insteon lighting presets, play a playlist from their Sonos speaker, or control Lutron smart blinds. Each button could store three actions, worked by identifying smart home devices on a shared Wi-Fi network, and was controllable via a dedicated Android or iOS app. The Pop Home Switch Starter Pack launched at $100, and individual Pop Add-on Home Switches debuted at $40 each. A company spokesperson told Ars Technica that Logitech informed customers on September 29 that their Pop switches would soon become e-waste.

After more than five years of foldable phones, we can probably give up on the latter. Google's new Pixel 10 Pro Fold retains the $1,800 price tag of last year's model, and while it's improved in several key ways, spending almost two grand on any phone remains hard to justify. For those whose phones are a primary computing device or who simply love gadgets, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is still appealing. It offers the same refined Android experience as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup , with much more screen real estate on which to enjoy it. Google also improved the hinge for better durability, shaved off some bezel, and boosted both charging speed and battery capacity. However, the form factor hasn't taken the same quantum leap as Samsung's latest foldable.

    "body": "The polymers around us are basically a disordered mess, with long chains of atoms tangled around each other. But starting around 1990, chemists began developing techniques that allow us to build polymers with precisely defined structures. These polymers, called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have distinct chemical properties: large pores that can be used to filter or store gases, catalytic centers within the polymer, and more. On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize Committee honored three researchers for their role in developing MOFs: Richard Robson for demonstrating the first MOF, and Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi for developing them to their full potential. Building a structure Most polymers are built from individual molecules that are linked together by flexible bonds, allowing the molecules to flop around. As a result, in their final form as something like a plastic bag or a bike tire, the polymers are a complicated tangle, with molecules wrapped around each other in no particular order. We can still control some aspects of the resulting polymer by manipulating its bulk properties or changing the molecules it's built from, but there's not a lot of chemistry we can do beyond that.

Companies have used them to build machines with dozens to hundreds of qubits, the error rates are coming down, and they've largely shifted from worrying about basic scientific problems to dealing with engineering challenges. Yet even at this apparently late date in the field's development, there are companies that are still developing entirely new qubit technologies, betting the company that they have identified something that will let them scale in ways that enable a come-from-behind story. Recently, one of those companies published a paper that describes the physics of their qubit system, which involves lone electrons floating on top of liquid helium. Trapping single electrons So how do you get an electron to float on top of helium? To find out, Ars spoke with Johannes Pollanen, the chief scientific officer of EeroQ, the company that accomplished the new work. He said that it's actually old physics, with the first demonstrations of it having been done half a century ago. Read full article Comments",

But the development of that electric vehicle was shelved earlier last year as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making in favor of humanoid robots . However, car sales still make up the overwhelming majority of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter. The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has software-locked batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack. Read full article Comments",

    "summary": "The first app store changes are due in a few weeks, with the major changes coming next summer.",
    "body": "Changes are coming to the Play Store in spite of a concerted effort from Google to maintain the status quo. The company asked the US Supreme Court to freeze parts of the Play Store antitrust ruling while it pursued an appeal, but the high court has rejected that petition. That means the first elements of the antitrust remedies won by Epic Games will have to be implemented in mere weeks. The app store case is one of three ongoing antitrust actions against Google, but it's the furthest along of them. Google lost the case in 2023, and in 2024, US District Judge James Donato ordered a raft of sweeping changes aimed at breaking Google's illegal monopoly on Android app distribution. In July, Google lost its initial appeal , leaving it with little time before the mandated changes must begin. Its petition to the Supreme Court was Google's final Hail Mary to avoid opening the Play Store even a crack. Google asked the justices to pause remedies pending its appeal, but the court has declined to do so, Reuters reports . Hopefully, Google planned for this eventuality because it must implement the first phase of the remedies by October 22. Read full article Comments",
