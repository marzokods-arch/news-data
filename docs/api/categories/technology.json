It’s called the Mudita Kompakt, and compared to other minimalist phones on the market today, it’s the first one I’m actually tempted to buy.",

There’s no word if this will be an on-device AI feature or if it requires an internet connection. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 phones have a variety of Galaxy AI features , ranging from call transcripts and summaries to generative image editing and writing tools. Now, it looks like the Galaxy S26 series could receive another neat AI-based addition. Leaker Ahmed Qwaider claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 series could tell you when you’re in danger of double-booking yourself. More specifically, the phones will apparently detect when you’re arranging a meeting/appointment in WhatsApp, Instagram, or SMS and warn you via a notification if this appointment clashes with any events already in your calendar.",

With Veo 3.1 , Google is finally catching up, and the main new feature is native vertical output for Ingredients to Video. Google said in a blog post that Veo 3.1 now lets Ingredients to Video create real vertical clips by default, so the model understands portrait framing (9:16) right away.
