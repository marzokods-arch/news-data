According to the update page : \"This update addresses an issue where closing Task Manager with the Close button didn’t fully end the process, leaving background instances that could slow performance over time. This might occur after installing KB5067036.\" I was hoping for a more esoteric description, like \"Stopped Task Manager's transformation into an immortal self-replicating being, hole in universe now patched,\" but there we go. It's not the only small fix in the latest update, either, as MS has also stamped out an annoying-sounding Windows handheld issue: \"This update addresses an issue that affects gaming handheld devices.

Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One.

In short, the kind of chips Valve would need to make a true Steam Deck 2 still aren't available and probably won't be until 2027. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Back in 2023, Steam Deck hardware specialist Yazan Aldehayyat said, \"I think for us to make a second version, we will be able to have a substantial performance improvement while sticking to a similar kind of power range and weight to battery life. And that's not going to happen next year or the year after that. It's probably going to be more than that.\" Two years on, Valve is still happy to say it plans a new second-gen Deck. But essentially, the same problem remains. \"We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version o…",

    "body": "Valve has announced a brand new VR headset. It's called the Steam Frame, and it's set to launch next year. While pricing is not yet confirmed, I've been to Valve HQ to try it out and get all the details. This isn't the Valve Index 2, it's something quite different, but it should still appeal to hardcore VR users and new users alike. The Steam Frame is a standalone VR headset. It doesn't require a PC in order to play games or watch videos in VR. It doesn't need base stations or a cable, either. It's powered by SteamOS, Valve's own Linux distro used on the Steam Deck , and an Arm chip. So, what makes this a PCVR headset again? \"We see Steam Frame as a streaming first headset,\" Lawrence Yang, a designer at Valve, tells me. Streaming in this context does not refer to cloud streaming or showcasing your skills on Twitch. Rather streaming means playing a game on a gaming PC and streaming it over to the Steam Frame via a wireless connection. So, you're streaming the game from one PC to another PC on your head, without using any cables. The Steam Frame includes a wireless adapter that plugs in via USB to a host PC, which can be any PC capable of running Steam and playing VR games. This wir…",

    "body": "Built by Valve, powered by SteamOS, the new Steam Machine is a compact gaming PC. One trying to make good on a promise Valve made a long time ago. With prototype Steam Machines heading out to reviewers back in 2013, us included , the company had grand plans of reinventing what constitutes a gaming PC around its new creation, a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. Years on, and following a few failed partner launches that you can read all about in our retrospective of their demise , the project was more or less doomed. By 2018, Valve pulled the plug . Or did it? Valve never stopped working on SteamOS, plugging away until it landed on the successful formula launched inside the Steam Deck in 2022. Following this success, Valve feels ready to take a second punt at a system with more firepower. \"We finally have all the software and the hardware bits to make the original vision a reality,\" Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, says during my visit to Valve HQ. They mention it's the right time because users are already making Steam Machines happen, putting a recovery image of SteamOS onto a range of devices or using their Steam Deck while docked. \"Our c…",

    "body": "Completing Power Out in Arc Raiders is one of the simpler quests you'll encounter in the game, but it might trip you up if you can't find the metal box you need to investigate, or work out where you're supposed to install the fuse. Unlike items in other quests, the fuse is similar to a Field Crate, so you actually have to heft it in your arms and lug it where it needs to go. Thankfully, that spot is quite close by. Since there are no items you need to exfil with in this quest, I recommend a free loadout . Otherwise, here's how to complete Power Out in Arc Raiders, finding the box in the Electrical Substation and installing the fuse to get it up and running again. How to complete Power Out in Arc Raiders You'll need to head to the Electrical Substation in southern Spaceport (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first goal is to head to the Electrical Substation in the south of the Spaceport, near to Staff Parking and the Security Checkpoint. Find the northernmost of the generator rows running through the station and, when entering from the west, you'll spot a small yellow-marked metal container on your left you can search. This will produce a fuse you can pick up . Your next objectiv…",
