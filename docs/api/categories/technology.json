The website itself is a fairly typical 'would you like to know more?' repository of background information: storyboard galleries, behind-the-scenes videos, Easter eggs, and other bits and bobs for fans who want to go deep on the whole thing.

Naturally, there's also a link leading to all kinds of Fallout stuff you can buy on Amazon. But what's caught some eyes is a countdown clock in the upper-right corner of the site's menu, which says \"coming soon\" when pointed at. At the moment, the clock indicates 27 days, 15 hours, and 51 minutes remaining: That sets the zero for February 4, which is when the final episode of Fallout season two airs. Mystery solved. …",

Just recently, Sony patented an AI-powered 'ghost' to guide you through games, Razer has made a holographic AI assistant in a test tube, golden child Larian is using generative AI in its development process for Divinity , and the biggest shooters on the market, Call of Duty and Battlefield 6 , are locked in a battle to sneak in as much terrible AI art as possible. It's grim out there. And then there's Embark Studios, which has used AI in both The Finals and its latest and greatest hit, Arc Raiders . Both prominently feature AI voices, for example, which has once again sparked debate over the ethics of using AI to generate assets for games that used to be created individually by people, whether artists or voice actors. Perhaps to help clear the air, in a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund expressed, \"I think people have misconceptions about what [AI] means.

If this wasn't convincing enough, Alienware China has announced a new Area-51 gaming PC with the new chip, which it notes as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D2. Furthermore, system builder Systronix has also listed a workstation with the chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 will likely deliver 16 cores, 32 threads and 192 MB of total L3 cache. All of which not only suggests the chip is set to launch, it's happening sometime soon, and it probably should have been included in AMD's CES 2026 announcements.

Not only are you practically under the control of the weather, but there's never any guarantee that you'll see anything good. That's why in the bleak midwinter when the last thing I want to do is go outside, I look for games like the demo of Flock Around which let me birdwatch without feeling the bitter cold. Plus, you are almost guaranteed to see a cool bird, which is always a nice plus. You take on the role of what is essentially a sentient, cylindrical blob who has been trusted with a camera and unleashed in a park. You can customise the colour, eyes, mouth, and clothing, but aside from that, there's not much going for you. That doesn't matter though, as you've got one job and one job only: take cool photos of the local wildlife. The demo gives you a guidebook with 20 birds to track down and photograph within, but with no clues or hints as to what to look for and what they sound like, so you best believe it's just a lot of point and click pictures and hoping for the best.

(Sony applied for the patent in 2023; these things take time.) The patent proposes an in-game interface that accepts \"natural language queries\" to identify which bit of the game you're stuck on, and then can either show you how to overcome the obstacle or take over and do it for you. I guess via possession? The \"ghost character\" who provides \"ghost assistance\" will be based on footage of other players, presumably scraped from YouTube by AI. There's already a Game Help feature on Playstation 5 that can bring up relevant videos when you're stuck, and this seems like a less jarring implementation of that. As far as throwing AI at videogames goes, it sounds pretty inoffensive to me. It's not costing anyone their job or, you know, devaluing the connection between artist and audience. If it means there's one less reason to splatter yellow paint telling us where to go all over videogames, this seems like a good thing. Of course, that's not how gamers have responded.

Now the rest of the cast has been announced via a post from the official u/PrimeVideo account on the Tomb Raider subreddit . It's a respectable list, with a few familiar names both among the actors and the characters they'll be playing. Zip, Lara's tech guy introduced in Tomb Raider: Chronicles, will be played by Martin Bobb-Semple; Winston, the Croft family's long-suffering butler, will be played by Bill Paterson; Atlas de Mornay, Lara's uncle, will be played by Jason Isaacs. Having Uncle Atlas be played by the actor most famous as Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter—though he deserves to be just as well-known for playing Field Marshal Zhukov in The Death of Stalin and Enver Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3—suggests he might turn out to not be a supportive family member.

Arc Raiders was planned as a free-to-play game for the majority of its lengthy development, but in late 2024, Embark pivoted to a traditional paid model . In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi , Embark founder Patrick Söderlund reflected on the decision, and said it was easier to cut against the grain of free-to-play after witnessing the success of other premium multiplayer games like Helldivers 2. \"It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'\" Söderlund said. \"We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue.

In a new interview with Games Beat , Embark's CEO Patrick Söderlund went into some detail on how the studio built the game's maps, and the big surprise for me was how closely they hew to certain real world inspirations. \"[Dam Battlegrounds] is the second one we made,\" says Söderlund. \"To get the first iteration done probably takes weeks before it's playable but ugly and then it takes… I think we probably spent 6 months on this map to playtest it and make it playable.\" \"The real work is actually making sure the map plays well.
