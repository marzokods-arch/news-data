    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Due to soaring RAM prices, smartphones in 2026 are expected to be more expensive while featuring less RAM than 2025 models. High-end 16GB RAM models may nearly disappear, and 12GB and 8GB models could see massive reductions in availability as makers revert to 8GB and 4GB RAM, respectively. Phone makers are caught between pricing pressures and reduced availability of consumer-grade DRAM as RAM manufacturers prioritize HBM supply for enterprise customers. 2026 isn’t shaping up to be a good year to buy a new phone, or any new tech in general. We’ve heard reports that phones are about to become more expensive due to RAM inflation . Now, new reports suggest that phone specs could actually start going backwards because of RAM inflation.

While Android trackers have improved enough to compete with the AirTag, the AirTag has long been awaiting an upgrade that would let it regain its lead.

Earlier today, OpenAI announced a major deal with Disney that will allow ChatGPT and Sora to create officially licensed, AI-generated imagery featuring the media giant’s popular characters. Now, Disney wants to stop another leading AI provider from doing the same. Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, accusing the company of copyright infringement in Gemini output. Variety reports that in a letter reviewed by the publication, Disney’s lawyers accuse Google of infringing on Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale,” citing Gemini’s ability to create imagery that includes copyrighted characters from across Disney’s expansive catalog of intellectual properties. Disney has apparently been informally communicating with Google about this for some time, but as of today, Gemini still readily produces imagery featuring Disney’s characters.",

But now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has announced that its products will soon be able to create images and videos of all your favorite Disney characters — with Disney’s blessing. OpenAI detailed the arrangement in a blog post this morning.

Like a toddler, our Sun occasionally has disruptive outbursts. But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

But Samsung has refused to abandon that ship, and might have actually addressed it with the upcoming Exynos 2600, which could power some of the Galaxy S26 models in certain regions. Not just Samsung appears so confident in its solution that it’s ready to offer it to other companies, including Apple and Qualcomm.

    "body": "TL;DR Google may be working on a native App Lock feature for Android 17 that lets users secure specific apps without the restrictions of Private Space. This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

Evidence found in the Google app shows a pop-up warning about “discarding conversation” when changing settings. The feature mirrors a recent YouTube experiment but is currently incomplete, with no input box actually available yet. YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next. The twist, though, is that this ability is facilitated through an AI chatbot that users must interact with by entering prompts. While it’s unclear whether YouTube will graduate this experiment into a permanent feature, it seems Google may be looking to bring this AI chatbot-powered custom feed to Discover as well.

Innovative products such as the Galaxy Z TriFold and a folding iPhone could drive sales for the category. Meanwhile, sales of regular phones could decline or stagnate over the next few years. Worldwide smartphone sales have seen a meager growth in 2025. Different research agencies have cited growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 3% for the first, second, and third quarters of the year. Meanwhile, the foldable category expanded at a much faster rate, with Counterpoint reporting 14% year-on-year growth in Q3 2025, led by the success of the reinvented Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its rivals in the book-style format. In 2026, this growth could nearly double as new and innovative products, such as the Galaxy Z TriFold , help shape the future of the foldable segment. A more recent IDC report predicts that the foldable segment will grow steadily through 2029. The next year, i.e., 2026, specifically will see an enormous 29.7% year-on-year growth in foldable sales.
