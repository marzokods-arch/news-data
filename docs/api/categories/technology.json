In recent times, one of the tricks publisher Oxford University Press (OUP) has used to maintain interest is to make its \"word or phrase of the year\" a very internet-aware prize: in 2013 the winner was \"selfie\", in 2015 it went to the \"emoji tears of joy\", and in 2022 the gong went to \"goblin mode.\" These days the process involves a public vote (based on a shortlist produced by the OED), which informs the final decision made by its stern-faced lexicographers. \"Rage bait\" beat out \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" to scoop the title. The OED defines \"rage bait\" thusly: \"Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account.\" So essentially the manipulative tactics deployed online by many unscrupulous publishers in order to get you mad, get you clicking, and get yo…",

When this was announced on November 25, 2025, shares from Asetek were valued at 0.82 Danish Krone, which means this offer represents a 110% increase on the price of shares alone. Asetek has been in a bit of a weird spot this year as a major watercooling patent expired in May , losing a key advantage it had in regards to liquid cooling. The day after the buyout announcement was made, Asetek's share price went up to 1.6 Danish Krone per share, almost doubling the value overnight. In the days following this announcement, share prices have stayed consistent. Asetek's full report says, \"Based on a thorough assessment, the board of directors of Asetek has concluded that the offer represents an attractive proposal to Asetek's shareholders and has unanimously decided that it intends to recommend that Asetek shareholders accept the offer w…",

The November edition of Steam's Hardware & Software survey reveals that Windows 10 is still clinging to life, with 29.06% of its user base still gaming on that OS. That's down by only 2.08% compared to October, with Windows 11 scooping up most of these defectors. As for the latest Windows OS itself, Windows 11 enjoyed a 2.02% increase in November, bringing its total slice of the software pie to 65.59%. So, no, we're hardly seeing folks jump from the good ship Windows 10 en masse. Those aforementioned extended security update schemes definitely have something to do with it, but that's also just the tip of the iceberg.

    "body": "It seems like it's only going to get harder to put together a gaming PC for a decent price in coming months, as reports suggest AMD will be increasing the cost of its CPUs. According to a report from Overclock3D citing \"industry sources\", AMD is reportedly looking to raise prices on its 9000-series CPUs, as well as \"AMD's older products\". OC3D claimed yesterday that the price hike will happen on the night of December 1, though we are unlikely to see the results of any such hike until the cost is pushed onto the buyer. The price change is reportedly at the distributor level, and therefore, down to those distributors to, well, distribute that price difference. With Cyber Week on , and deals still live, many sellers will be capitalising on that momentum to keep deals around for a little longer. It might not be until the sales fervour wears off that we see the impact of any increase, if one actually happens. Obviously, that's not guaranteed yet. There are currently ongoing price hikes with RAM and, to a lesser degree, SSDs , though AMD's argument is said to be unrelated. Unfortunately, that means we don't have much information on why specifically AMD might be raising its prices, but w…",

Hell, all we really know is that you'll get an XP boost, enhanced Scrappy, an unknown amount of additional stash space, and bonus skill points based on the value of the items in your stash on the departure date (December 21). Don't ask me for specifics because, well, we don't have them. Only Embark does, and it's not telling. The only solace I can give you is that, in an update by community manager Lily on the Arc Raiders Discord server last week, it was confirmed that the \"skill point and stash space bonuses are permanent\". Additionally, they're based on your stash value and how much money you've got in your wallet at the time of departure. That's great news for anyone committing to the Expedition Project and, honestly, might be what tempts me to take the plunge.

Well, The Verge holds that honour, as this is where I learned about the File Explorer bug in Microsoft's KB5070311 update for Windows 11 . As is the norm in such update reports, the description of the issue tries to downplay the problem a tad: \"After installing KB5070311, you might experience issues when opening File Explorer in dark mode.

Luckily, the anticipated farming update is set to launch on December 15, which I'm sure is only going to make my quest procrastination worse. Farming will be the game's tenth skill, and to me, definitely the most exciting one. Not only that, but it's the first skill to exceed the previous skill cap too, so you'll be able to venture all the way to level 65 if you're a particularly green thumb.

Some dabbled with the idea of virtual sheriffs, while others took to naming and shaming on Reddit, but now they've taken to using a new tool. The Speranza Watchlist has been circling raider groups for about a week now, as some celebrate finally having a concrete way to report evil players, while others lament that they've been wrongly accused of some heinous crimes: \"Bro, I have 219 reports on an account that I haven't been able to use for the past week.\" (Image credit: Embark) I too had an outrageous bounty levied against me. With an evil rating of A, a certified menace, I'm apparently the worst of the worst. With over 400 reports against my name. Which is ridiculous considering I haven't even encountered 400 people during my time in Arc Raiders. But none of that really matters, because The Speranza Watchlist isn't real.

Players bravely adopting such creativity mere weeks into Arc Raiders' life—a game where terrifying robots and other players are out for your life and loot, remember—was an amazing thing to watch. Somehow, I think that's already been topped after I watched 'director of gametography' create three (admittedly very short) short films live with random players, called Final Call, Last Chance, and Ready to Run: As the creator explains, they're a videographer by trade, and you can really tell when you see them in action in Arc Raiders. They've already taken things to the next level of in-game photography, such as placing ziplines for aerial tracking shots, filming actions from multiple angles, and using equipment like smoke bombs for special effects. There are some really nice shots across the three short films, and it goes to show just how cinematic Arc Raiders' animations and overall gameplay are, especially when the Arc machines are added into …",

But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best. Preloading (or pre-caching) is meant to speed up the load times of File Explorer, which have, so far, been a major downgrade compared to Windows 10. Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

Along the way, though, the inevitable topic of AI and what it means for human labour and creativity reared its head. It sounds like Houser isn't quite as starry-eyed about the tech as so many other people who continue to occupy corporate C-suites. Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models.

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process.

The genres don't matter much; you just have to find three specific stands inside the building.
