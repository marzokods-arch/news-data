The trailer starts out looking like it could almost be a Witcher spinoff: The UI, music, voices, even the way the medieval city resembles Novigrad all smacked me in the face. Junior cadet vampire Coen has Geralt's signature messy high ponytail (but in brunette), and he also shares a name with a prominent book witcher absent from the games. The quest in question is a Witcher 3 monster hunt almost to a T: Coen talks to some \"cor blimey\" yokels⁠—with, I do have to say, delightfully craggy, varied, character actor-type faces⁠—who point him in the direction of monster-type happenings to earn access to a cathedral's library. Coen uses the exact same Witcher Senses as Geralt (down to the sepia filter and red outlines!) to uncover a feral vampire's lair, and the beast even cribs the Bruxa scream attack from Blood and Wine. That's not necessarily bad: There hasn't…",

You can observe the beginnings of Hideo Kojima's signature style, particularly in Metal Gear 2, and these are the games that actually show Snake's battles with Big Boss⁠—as well as body double and MGS5 protagonist, Venom Snake⁠—that would reverberate for the rest of the series.

    "body": "I recently sat down with Defect game director and former id Software artist , Emanuel Palalic, as well as composer Mick Gordon to discuss the upcoming cyberpunk FPS . One topic I wanted to get their thoughts on was optimization: Defect looks like a heavy game, but has surprisingly lenient specs⁠—RTX 2060 minimum⁠—and no mandatory ray tracing like we're starting to see in some games. The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those. When you look at older games, Killzone 2 looks incredi…",

As reported by The Game Post , which also shared the details on the original story about the fan revival, Sony has allegedly started cracking down on gameplay videos of the undead hero shooter. The Game Post article states that multiple videos uploaded by the team behind the revival have received DMCA strikes from MarkScan, a digital asset protection firm that has swung the enforcer bat for Sony in the past . The article also relays a message from the project devs on Discord: \"Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.\" It doesn't sound like Sony has come directly for the team or its fan revival at the time of writing, but this indicates it's likely already on the studio's radar and may not be long for this world.

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself.

Iger was speaking on Disney's quarterly earnings call this Thursday ( thanks, Variety ) and, in the context of Disney+ merging with Hulu, went into the platform's future with AI-based games and user-generated content (UGC). Disney+ should be \"a portal to all things Disney,\" said Iger, and \"with the deployment of AI\" it can be used \"as an engagement engine for people who want to go to our theme parks, want to stay at our hotels, want to enjoy our cruises, our cruise ships. And obviously, there’s a huge opportunity for games.\" In one way this is just Disney being Disney: the entertainment giant already offers an incredibly vast and varied catalogue with countless world-famous brands, and ever since the original Disneyland has offered its most devoted fans that wraparound experience of a fantasy vacation. \"There are great opportunities in terms of our collection of data and our mining of data,\" a breathless Iger told analysts.

    "body": "It's been a difficult few months for Destiny 2, ever since the release of The Edge of Fate expansion's Portal—a new progression system that replaced the old seasonal content model with, bluntly, a soulless and underbaked grind. I've written extensively about my problems with the Portal's many baffling design choices, but until now Bungie has only tentatively admitted to the size of the problem. A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. \"Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was …",

However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community.\" Talking about the challenges the Paralives dev team has overcome over the past six years, Mas…",

Maybe you got into a tussle with another raider or stumbled into the path of a very angry arc; regardless of how it happens, you have to fix yourself up before heading topside again. If you're just using a light shield, then repairs aren't an issue at all, as all you need are regular plastic parts. But if you have a medium shield it'll cost much more. Repairing a medium shield costs requires arc circuitry and one battery. Now, the battery isn't exactly a precious resource, but the arc circuitry is. I only have seven lying around in my inventory right now, and if your shield is damaged below 50% you'll need two of these to repair it. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Embark Studios) So if you find yourself in a particularly rough spot, with your medium shield below 50%, it actually makes more sense to just recycle it and make a new one. Scrapping your medium shield will give you one arc circuitry, which you can then reuse to make a fresh shield alongside one battery. It's a much …",
