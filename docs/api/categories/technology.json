Just because it's a game you only ever half-heartedly play while you're stuck at your desk waiting for the clock to hit 5:00 pm so you can go home and play some real games? Maybe so, but that's about to change, as 400 players will be flown to Miami to sit at poker tables playing Solitaire on iPads (at least according to the video on that page). Can you feel the excitement? Not really? Let me up the ante, then: they'll be competing (at Solitaire on iPads, remember) for a chance to win $150,000, and it's all being presided over by notorious ESPN loudmouth Stephen A. Smith. If you're still not excited, you must at least be curious about how you could possibly make Solitaire interesting to watch, even with the boisterous Smith tapped to host.

Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points. Using those measurements, they resized images of the overhead view of each in-game map until they shared a scale of 1 pixel per meter. \"There's always the risk of …",

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray.

The series that put the Swedish studio on the map has been missing in action since 2018, and if the words of its creator are anything to go by, we won't be seeing another one any time soon, if ever. In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

I'll be honest, I've never really understood the 'RPG to action game' pipeline that many popular series—and studios—have gone through. Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true.

As of today, those in the Windows 11 Insider dev or beta channels will have the option of accessing the Windows Full Screen Experience on the MSI Claw range of handhelds. In order to get it on your Claw, you need to be on the latest Insider Preview Build of Windows 11 (KB5067115), then you have to go into the gaming section of the Settings menu, and enable 'full screen experience'. As it's in a staged rollout, you may not see it when you boot your device up, but it should hopefully arrive over the next few weeks or so. The full-screen experience functions primarily as a UI overlay for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, and makes a Windows device feel a little closer to a console. It aggregates all your games from different storefront…",

Pleasingly then, one tech tinkerer has pushed Windows 7 to its Lilliputian limits. X user @XenoPanther shared a 69 MB version of Windows 7 x86 that just about boots (via The Register ). Created more just to see if they could rather than as an actually usable OS, @XenoPanther writes , \"Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.\" The punchline, though? The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org .

    "body": "Cosplay is still a bit of an unknown world to me, but it's one I'd love to be more involved with. I've only ever cosplayed once, really—aside from the odd Halloween costume which I know doesn't really count—but that doesn't mean I don't try to stay as in the loop as possible. I've always been more of a lurker, spending hours scrolling through social media admiring everyone's commitment to their favourite characters, and I am constantly impressed by the creativity the cosplay community showcases. Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. It's been a big weekend for all sorts of cosplayers with MCM ComicCon and EGX in London, and the turnout of people rocking up dressed in their nerdiest best has not disappointed. So, instead of saving all of my favourites to a folder I'll inevitably visit once in a blue moon, trying to convince myself I'll sink more time into cosplay one of these days, I thought I'd share them with you…",

    "body": "Draknek and Friends is a pretty reliable puzzle-maker, dropping a new worth-playing gem every few years. Now they've released Spooky Express, an update of their delightful 2017 Cosmic Express, just in time for a little spooky-themed fall puzzling. In a round of Spooky Express, your job is to lay out train tracks so that you pick up and drop off passengers where they're trying to go. Vampires to their coffins, zombies to their graves, and humans as far away from here as they can get. The trick is that your tracks can't pass over each other, there's only room for one passenger per car, and there are fixed entrances and exits to each tiny area. The land of \"Trainsylvania\" has over 200 levels for you to figure out, with exactly the kind of thoughtful design you'd expect from Draknek. Which is to say that each area starts off fairly simple, with levels introducing new concepts and ways to use puzzle elements before delivering excellent brain-burning problems to solve with just the same materials you'd found so easily a few levels before. It runs great on Steam Deck, by the way. Very pleasing. It's also on Remote Play Together on Steam, so you can collaboratively solve with others remot…",
