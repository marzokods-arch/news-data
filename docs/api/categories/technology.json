Players shared more than just puzzle solutions online, they began piecing together the sprawling story that takes place outside the mansion's walls, which includes generations of history about the world of Blue Prince. The non-linear nature of the game and the sheer amount of information concealed within it makes it hard to know if you've found everything in Blue Prince, even if you've technically finished the game. I've played for 83 hours and watched a number of videos explaining mysteries I never solved myself—and I still don't feel like I know the whole story. Speaking with Blue Prince developer Tonda Ros of Dogubomb this week, I asked if players had discovered everything hidden in the mansion of Blue Prince, or if there were still mysteries in the game that no one had figured out. \"There are certainly mysteries still in the game, and there will probably always be some mysteries in the game,\" Ros said. \"And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved. \"I know that for some games, they…",

According to SteamDB, which uses public data from the Steam API, there are 81,000 users playing Call of Duty on Steam at time of writing—well below the player counts of Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, which are currently drawing around 370,000 and 236,000 simultaneous players, respectively. This does place Call of Duty in the top 10 of most-played games on Steam. But in comparison, when a similar amount of time had passed since Black Ops 6's midnight launch in 2024, Call of Duty was being played by almost 230,000 players on Steam.

A series of patches and U-turns have tried to soften the abrasive edges of the Portal's design—aimed at reducing the absurd power grind as well as making buildcrafting feel less restrictive and punishing. Still, these felt like temporary stopgaps—desperate attempts to staunch the bleed that didn't address the root issues at the heart of the new design. In a blog post last night, Bungie finally laid it all out: \"With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game.

If you're just using a light shield, then repairs aren't an issue at all, as all you need are regular plastic parts. But if you have a medium shield it'll cost much more. Repairing a medium shield costs requires arc circuitry and one battery. Now, the battery isn't exactly a precious resource, but the arc circuitry is.

    "body": "Being a tech journalist, hell, even just being a PC gamer in 2025, means that you have to accept that every time you hear from a hardware company about some new product they're releasing, or feature they're adding, it will almost exclusively be something to do with AI. Whether directly, indirectly, tangentially, or just plain pointlessly. So, thank you Valve, for offering up three new pieces of Steam hardware this week that made not one mention of the initialism de jour: AI. The closest we got was when its engineers noted the Steam Machine was being targeted for 4K60 gaming, but only via the use of upscaling. Even then, it's an AMD-based system, and FSR has only just got itself updated to machine learning algorithms with the FSR 4 update. That, however, is still effectively tied to the Radeon RX 9000-series of graphics cards, and most definitely not available to the Navi 33 GPU at the heart of the Steam Machine's discrete GPU.

That doesn't mean there isn't something to catch your eye, though, and an announcement from Adata and MSI, as well as a rumour about SK hynix, is great news for anyone who wants to go absolutely ham with RAM. Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules. Where most DIMMs have just one or two ranks of memory, these sticks will be so loaded with DRAM modules that each one will offer up to 128 GB of capacity. Not only that, they'll be rated to run…",

Since grabbing both items in this quest is primarily based on RNG, I'd suggest you bring a safe pocket with which to store either should you strike lucky. Despite having good loot, Stella Montis feels like a pretty friendly map at the moment, as players fight through so many Arc that they barely have time to kill each other. All that said, here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.

And naturally, people have already got to work on boot screens tailored to the upcoming Steam Machine. In particular, this GabeCube one posted by Redditor DentureTaco will surely be a go-to. The 'GabeCube' meme is already a little overused but frankly, I don't care. It's too good not to use, and this faux GameCube animation is fantastic.

This is the bottom layer of the map, which you can head down into via the metro entrances in the Lobby, or you can do what I did, and dro…",

    "body": "I'm going to be honest for a second: I don't like using keys in Arc Raiders . I've found that trying to shoehorn a high loot run into a match doesn't always work out well, and I don't like how I have to put the key in my only safe slot just in case some murderous player rounds a corner at a bad time. I'd much rather just go with the flow and see where the round ends me up. But the problem with that is that chances are, when you need a key card, you won't have one. Unless you have some creative friends by your side. Last night PC Gamer's strategic director Evan Lahti was playing Arc Raiders with his squad when he came across a very convenient hack. If one of your squad members places themself right in the corner of the door and another raider jumps on their head, then it'll clip them through the locked door. Once the person who clipped inside can then open the door to let the rest of their squad inside. And then voila, you can all get some high-level loot without the hassle of bringing in a key card. The locked room in question they managed to break into, was the Dam Control Tower. This is one of the high-level loot spots on the Dam Battleground map, located in the centre of the ma…",

This region is pretty dicey, filled with a high density of dangerous Arc enemies like Shredders (effectively murder janitor-bots) plus the regular cast of Wasps, Hornets, Pops, Ticks, and Turrets. The only thing is they're much worse now since the entire map is indoors and you have less space to maneuver. For Lance's quest, you have to find three androids around the map, but thankfully these aren't three specific androids, so you can complete this quest by visiting multiple areas, or even across multiple runs, since there's no single run restriction. Below I'll explain what to look for and where to look. I'd also recommend a free loadout since you're not exfilling any items this time. Where to find androids for the In My Image quest in Arc Raiders You're looking for bodies like this scattered all around Stella Montis (Image credit: Embark Studios) There aren't three specific androids you need to find in Stella Montis .

But I shouldn't have underestimated the Arc Raiders community, as we've completed the task in record time. After just 38 hours, Stella Montis has been unlocked as the community rallied together last night to shovel an obscene amount of resources into the required communal pot. Just for some context, by this point yesterday, the event was more or less only 2% complete. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Now the next stage of the community event is up, and it gives players more chances to earn new loot and cosmetics. Staking Our Claim requires players to actually go to Stella Montis and make a dent there against arcs and maybe even other raiders. The only real goal is to earn XP; it doesn't matter how you do it. 100 XP equals 1 merit, and there are 24 milestones for players to check in and get loot at, with the last prize sitting at a pretty 3,600 merits. If you donated the full amount of resources in the first stage of the event, then you'll have a bit of a head start with…",

Existing chip export restrictions preventing Nvidia from selling its top-end hardware to China remain, but The Wall Street Journal claims it has traced how 32 Nvidia GB 200 server racks, containing 2,300 Blackwell chips, made their way to China via an Indonesian company—eventually ending up in the hands of a Chinese AI tech provider. According to the WSJ, the chips were bought from Nvidia by Silicon Valley-based AI server manufacturer Aivres , which operates under a parent company that is one-third-owned by Inspur, a Chinese company that was added to the US government's trade blacklist in 2023, over claims that it worked on Chinese military supercomputing projects. Aivres went on to sell the 32 Nvidia GB200 server racks to an Indonesian telecoms company, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison , the WSJ claims, for around $100 million.

That's right, you're no longer limited to the set of animals you can pick from at the start of the game, we're getting a pair of amphibians. The two characters shown in the reveal are an axolotl and a frog, and much like every other critter you can pick as your playable character, you'll still be able to customise them with the colour palettes you've unlocked while exploring the island. Which is fantastic news as it'll take a lot for me to change my current pastel pink bunny. On the topic of customisation, a few of the patch notes also share that tweaks have been made to certain clothing items. Clipping issues for the Monster Beanie, Scholastic Berets, My Melody Pirate Hat, and the My Sweet Piano outfit have now been resolved, meaning no matter the shape of your character you'll be able to make the most of your wardrobe.

Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September. Ever since the Last Epoch Kickstarter in 2018, EHG promised that once you buy the game, everything…",
