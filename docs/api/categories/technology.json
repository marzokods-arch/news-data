Available from today, in a blog post Microsoft says the app will bring gamers, \"the experience you know and love—ready for you to download, play and enjoy.\" The blog post also called out the fact that Windows on Arm's Prism emulation layer, which allows x86 software including games to run on Arm chips, has been updated to support AVX and AVX2 insturctions. That should broaden support and reduce the number of existing PC games that won't run on Arm PCs. Microsoft claims that, \"today, more than 85% of the Game Pass catalog is compatible with these PCs, and we’re actively working with partners to expand support even further.\" It also says, \"Epic Anti-Cheat (EAC) support also enables fan favorites for games on Arm-based Windows 11 PCs, including popular titles such as Gears of War: Reloaded, Fortnite and more.\" If this is all very promising, there is a catch.

Turns out, if you build an entire game around requiring 12 separate WeakAuras (programmable UI elements) and nameplate mods, that's not the best experience for anybody. Even as an experienced player, I spent ages futzing around to get my WeakAuras just-so.

But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox.

The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions.
