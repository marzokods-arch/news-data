On the other hand, if you do it wrong, then everyone's going to be insufferably mad at you for the rest of the game's lifespan. Which, for a two-decade-plus game like WoW, is gonna be a while. That doesn't mean World of Warcraft isn't going to keep trying, mind you. The Worldsoul Saga is one of Blizzard's most ambitious moves yet—committing to a three-expansion story arc where everything's been more-or-less planned out, giving them the chance to tell larger, bigger-reaching narratives. Narratives where someone is gonna bite the dust at some point, most likely. That's per an interview by PCG contributor Heather Newman, written for issue 420 of our magazine that'll be hitting shelves soon. Heather spoke to both game director Ion Hazzikostas and design director Maria Hamilton about Midnight , the midpoint of the Worldsoul Saga—and both WoW leads emphasised that the team is winding up for some big swings. \"There will be important characters that do not survive the trilogy.

Then Peanut downs himself with a grenade, and another teammate stays by his side to administer first aid to prevent him from dying. He's only revived when the first teammate who ran off makes it to the top of Spaceport Tower, and for some reason, the snap hook triggers and sends the Peanut flying off towards that direction, soaring through the air: \"Look at me go! I'm flying, I'm flying.\" TheBurntPeanut new meta from r/ArcRaiders It's a pretty funny clip, and honestly, on the tamer side of things I've seen The Burnt Peanut do in Arc Raiders, but it does demonstrate how the snap hook still has some movement tech for players to take advantage of.

Though the company may have just won a very important customer: Nvidia. According to Digitimes , citing supply chain sources, Nvidia has signed on with Intel Foundry to manufacture some parts of its forthcoming Feynman chips. Nvidia will reportedly use Intel for only some of its chips, namely the non-core bits. It's said to be choosing between Intel Foundry's 18A or 14A process nodes, dependent on whether Intel has high enough yields to reliably produce enough chips on the latter. TSMC, the top dog in Taiwan, will still be leading the charge with the most important silicon, the GPU itself. Most likely on its A16 process node. Feynman is the next major architecture on from Rubin and Rubin Ultra, which is set to arrive from 2028.

Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025.

    "body": "When Valve bizarrely vetoed the launch of horror adventure game Horses on Steam last year, its plucky competitor GOG was quick to swoop in . \"We’re proud to give HORSES a home on GOG,\" announced the storefront, \"giving players another way to enjoy the game. We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.\" In an interview this month, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski referred to Horses when he declared that \"We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values\". That rankled some onlookers who remembered that, well, that wasn't always GOG's stance. In 2020, it came under fire for unceremoniously dumping Devotion , which had become subject of repression in China for memes seemingly mocking president Xi Jinping. In a new interview with Eurogamer , Gołębiewski chatted a bit about how GOG looks back on that episode. \"That situation remains difficult to reflect on,\" said Gołębiewski. \"At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game…",

    "body": "It can be easy for us consumers and PC gamers to think we're the only victims of the memory shortage and resultant high prices. But in fact plenty of companies are scrambling to pick up whatever scraps the AI industry leaves behind, too. If we need a clear reminder of this, Zotac Korea has just given us a warning about how serious the situation is for the company and graphics cards in general. The company just announced on its website that \"the current situation is extremely serious—serious enough to raise concerns about the very survival of graphics card manufacturers and distributors going forward.\" That's according to X user and tech talker harukaze5719's translation , which aligns pretty closely with Google's machine translation. The company claims that not only has the price of the RTX 5090 \"increased sharply\", but also for the RTX 5060. Presumably it's referring to the price the company is paying Nvidia for the GPUs. Because of these increased prices, Zotac Korea is cutting its rewards points policy. The AI-induced memory shortage is, of course, most clearly pertinent to RAM, but it's also pertinent to GPUs because these also use memory, this being GDDR video memory. If ther…",

Well, actually, I'll let Mozilla's New Products SVP, Peter Rojas, tell you : \"Our mission at Mozilla is to ensure the internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.\" Selected Pioneers will work on new products that help move towards this, as the program is for \"a supporter of Mozilla and its mission as the end goal is to build with us full time.\" In addition to gelling with its controversial decision to have Firefox \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" , this also aligns with the company's recent announcement of its \"open-source AI strategy.\" Closed AI systems, Mozilla's CTO Raffi Krikorian says, are currently winning: \"I understand the appeal firsthand, because I’ve made the same choice myself on late-night side projects when I just wanted the fastest path from an idea in my head to something I could actually…",

Sure, it's not quite as down to luck as With a View , but you'll have to brave Stella Montis' Shredder-infested Cultural Archives instead. In Movie Night's most complicated step, Apollo sends you to the Cultural Archives to find the Stack of Movie Tapes, which you'll then have to extract to deliver to him. You'll also need to find a Portable TV , but I'll go over where to find it all below. Where to find the Stack of Movie Tapes in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) You can find the Stack of Movie Tapes in a pile of furniture in the southwest corner of Cultural Archives , to the right of the entrance via the Atrium. Interact with the pile of furniture to find the Stack of Movie Tapes item, which you'll need to collect. As shown in the video below, if you're entering from the Atrium, just head down the stairs into the Cultural Archives and immediately turn right to find some old furniture covered with a white sheet.
