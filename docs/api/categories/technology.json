    "body": "Every year there's space penciled into the PC games release calendar for an unlikely indie game hit to blow the doors off the Steam charts. This year it was Schedule 1 that had my group chat in a chokehold for several weeks. If you missed out on the drug-dealing crafting sim back in March, you're not out of the game for good. It got a pretty big \"Cartel Update\" back in August and has now hit the Steam Autumn Sale with a juicy 30% discount. Despite the goofy-looking characters, we clocked early on that Schedule 1 isn't just a meme game and that it totally gets around the crafting game malaise by turning crafting into fun minigames . There's your free talking points for any friends who skipped the initial wave on this one who you may be able to twist into getting it on sale. It's me; I'm the friend in the group chat who missed it and is feeling a bit tempted by the discount. You can snag Schedule 1 on Steam for $14/£11.72 until the Autumn Sale closes next week on October 6, which isn't bargain bin but is a nice cut out of the $20 it normally goes for. Schedule 1 has actually already had a 30% discount during this year's Summer Sale and in early September, so you can probably count o…",

Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more.

Huang emphasises, \"We’re up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor in China]\" (via Tom's Hardware ). These comments follow a podcast passage where Huang is generally complementary about the current US administration. Huang said, \"[President Trump] wants America to win the AI race. This is going to be a very long-term race, and he understands this is a pivotal time. He wants the technology industry to run. He wants everybody in the world to be built on American technology.\" But China has been busy, accelerating its own AI infrastructure plans with a reported mandate that its domestic data centres source at least 50% of their chips from similarly domestic manufacturers to avoid a reliance on US-made tech.

Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally. Both devices are set to launch on October 16. If you want to snag a Xbox Ally, it's best to avoid eBay entirely. At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double. If you consider the ROG Xbox Ally X part of the Xbox line-up ( which Microsoft seems to ), it's the most expensive Xbox to date.

Today's show was quite the change from our usual summer and Most Wanted broadcasts. The Tokyo Game Show has been going for almost 30 years, so we figured it was high time we got in on the action and highlighted some of the excellent games there. People at the show were lucky enough to get hands on with Farmbotic, a cozy farming sim with adorable robot companions. For those of us at home, the trailer in our Tokyo Direct still gives a good glimpse at what it's all about. For your viewing pleasure, we've got the zombie carnage of Killing Floor 3, the cartoonish and charmingly British Earth Must Die, and one of the coolest games we've ever seen, Denshattack, where you play as a train carriage that's also the best skateboarder in the world.

Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like.

Also clock that style meter in the top right; this is a game that takes after Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds.

In a new trailer unveiled today during the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, we get our first look at the NPCs you'll be helping. You'll meet Tea Practitioner Nami, a white cat called Taiko, and a disgruntled fisherman. The gang's all here. You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of.

Even visual showstoppers like Half-Life Alyx embrace Rayman-style floating hands as an elegant solution for first person interactions in VR, but Reach is itching to tear down any barrier to immersion. It looks to be an action adventure taking after the likes of Uncharted and Square Enix's Tomb Raider games, just paired with all the trappings of virtual reality: a very intimate view, motion controls, and a shock when your cat brushes past your leg.
