The shooter wasn't quite done cooking back then, but the oven timer's finally dinging: Arc Raiders will be out on October 30. We'll have a full review after getting some time in with the launch version, but for now you can check out our Arc Raiders review-in-progress (the short version: we like it). Below is everything we know about the launch-day rollout. When does Arc Raiders launch? Arc Raiders launches at 2:30 am Pacific on October 30, 2025 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, as well as Xbox and PlayStation consoles. The specific launch hour isn't listed on Arc's official site or Steam page, but developer Embark announced it on the Discord server.

Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago. As expected, folks are taking their frustrations out on Battlefield 6's Steam rating , which has now dropped to an overall \"Mixed\" after an influx of over 5,000 negative reviews since yesterday. The flood of negative ratings pile on to an existing trend dating back over a week, around the time players were reacting to the too-blue \"Wicked Grin\" cosmetic , and when DICE axed XP gains from Portal servers in a bid to eliminate XP farms. \"Before season one it was like the moment when Gandalf showed in Helm's Deep there was hope.

We spent the better part of this year lamenting ridiculously high GPU prices , and as soon as said prices finally start dropping , memory and storage prices start climbing. You might have noticed this worrying trend if you've been looking for a RAM upgrade lately. Charts on pcpartpicker.com are telling: since mid-2025, DDR4 and DDR5 consumer memory kit prices have been climbing, with particularly notable spikes since September. That's true all the way from DDR4-3200 kits up to DDR5-6000 ones. To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025. DDR4 isn't safe, either, as this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3600 kit on Amazon shows. It was stable at about $70 through most of the year, but excluding a brief drop back to down to this original price, from mid-August it shot up to a new price of $161. That's a 115…",

What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too.

I haven't had as long as I'd like with Embark's new extraction shooter, so this review is indeed in progress, with the final version coming sometime in the future when I've had a chance to properly experience it in all of its intersocial beauty. The premise of Arc Raiders is simple: the world has gone to hell thanks to robots and AI, so now all the humans are holed up in small communities underground, with you and other raiders occasionally popping up to the surface to gather resources to trade, create gear, and upgrade your base. On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff. You have to navigate these problems all while finding loot and extracting before the timer runs out. Escaping Tarkov Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: E…",

But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.
