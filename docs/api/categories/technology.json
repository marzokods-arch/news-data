Capcom eventually agreed to let GOG re-release Dino Crisis and the first three Resident Evils, though it took \"time, persistence, and trust-building,\" Gnyp says.

There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd.

Deep of Night isn't endless in the sense that you just keep going day after day until you die, but it is endless in the sense that you rank up or down depending on whether you win a run, and then your progress affects your rank, which you can keep working towards. (Image credit: FromSoftware) It's largely more of the same, with the two-day expedition followed by Nightlord finale, the same maps, and the same kinds of enemies that inhabit them. The main differences lie in how strong these enemies can get and what kind of weapons you can find around the map. Not only do the regular grunts hit harder now, but there are souped-up versions of enemies called mutants with a bloody-red tinge to them.

And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe.
