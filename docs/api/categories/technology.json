Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard. We had all these backer builds that came out once every two or three months. Progress towards the final game was getting slower, though, and the game is complex.

The full paper elaborates: \"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds, with some users progressing through conventional relationship milestones, including formal engagements and marriages.\" The research team's findings are drawn from a sample of \"1,506 posts collected between 2024 and 2025\" from the aforementioned 27,000+ strong subreddit.

Our chums over at Windows Central dropped the details on this one, though I'd already seen it in action through social media (e.g. Phantomofearth on X ). Very simply, in a current beta build of Windows 11, you can select a movie file for the desktop wallpaper to have a fancy animated view behind your horde of shortcut icons (or behind absolutely nothing, if you're like me and hate icons on your desktop).

It's a great way to showcase your build, however, and the Frame 4500X wears it well. I've shown a few people this case since building a PC into it for testing, and it quite literally has the wow factor (both people said 'wow' out loud—very satisfying). There's also a flowing design to the vents, sweeping from the rear of the top panel and down to the front of the side panel. This helps let the case and cooling solution breathe, but, very importantly, helps keep the non-windowed side of the case exciting and more of a match for the windowed side.

However, one report claims that TMSC plans to raise the price for its next-generation N2 process node so much that processors made on it will have to be a lot more expensive to cover the cost. That's according to China Times (via Dan Nystedt on X ), which claims that industry sources have told them that the price for TSMC's N2 process node will be more than 50% higher than N3. It notes that the Taiwanese firm's current best node, N3P, is around 20% higher than the previous generation N5. Price increases in semiconductor wafer manufacturing are inevitable, especially when it concerns the very best process nodes. That's because all of the equipment used to make the wafers has to be better than the apparatus used for earlier nodes.

    "body": "Big tech is capable of throwing around some eye-watering amounts of cash. As you may recall, Nvidia announced $46.7 billion total revenue during its Q2 2025 earnings call. That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power. As such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres. The two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket. Once this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10…",

Void Interactive very quickly complied: Kaminsky was removed from the Discord server and their presence largely scrubbed from Void Interactive's website , and just ahead of the weekend the studio posted a message on Steam saying Kaminsky was gone. \"We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,\" Void Interactive wrote. \"These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. \"We have ended our …",

Instead of writing, \"Wow, look at my busted-up leg,\" however, he shared a poem: Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

I'm not sure when we started calling these things \"server slams\" rather than playtests, but the term is certainly evocative in reflecting the goal: Ensuring, as much as such a thing is possible, that the servers for a popular online game won't collapse under the weight of the launch-day rush of players. To that end, the Arc Raiders slam is wide open, available on all platforms— Steam and Epic for PC, plus PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S—and with no pre-registration required: Just show and go. \"This is where we’ll really put Arc Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch,\" executive producer Aleksander Grøndal said. \"Our goal is simple: Make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we've intended—polished, balanced, and ready for action.\" Hopefully, anyway, although these things have a ha…",

It has a 32-bit Arm Cortex M4 processor, 384 kB of flash memory and up to 64 kB of SRAM. Christophel notes that it would need \"that last bit of RAM\" to run Doom natively, so this version is effectively sending game output to a bit of software, which flips the screen to run on the vape. In other words, a PC runs Doom but displays it on the vape's touchscreen via a USB Type-C cable. Christophel says you can \"use it as a second monitor\", which makes sense, should you have to show a mouse or some sort of small pet a duplicate of your screen. Hey, it's nice to have the option.
