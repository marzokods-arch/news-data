Beyond the declaration that it's building a ' rebel alliance ' to challenge Big Tech's current plans for AI-integrated toasters and the like, it's now announced a new AI controls section within the browser's settings menu. It'll begin rolling out in Firefox 148, which is due to release on February 24, and looks to be an easy way to block \"current and future generative AI features\" within the browser.

Featuring a beamforming microphone, the G325 ditches the usual boom arm we're used to seeing on gaming headsets. It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here. I'm yet to try out the Logitech headset myself, but Logitech employees using the headset sounded clear enough in a pre-briefing call in a quiet space. But hey, we can put it to the test soon ourselves. The G325 are wireless cans, with both Logitech's 2.4 GHz tech, Lightspeed Wireless, and Bluetooth 5.2. They also support 24-bit audio, though no word on the exact drivers used here to make the most of it. Logitech G32…",

Then yesterday, Reuters posted a story detailing the reported dissatisfaction of OpenAI with Nvidia's GPUs, specifically for the task of inferencing AI models. If the latter story looks a lot like somebody at OpenAI hitting back at the original Wall Street Journal claims, the two narratives combined feel like just the sort of tit-for-tat off-the-record briefing that occurs when an alliance is beginning to falter. For now, none of this is official. It's all rumour. However, it is true that Nvidia's intention to invest $100 billion in OpenAI was announced in September and has yet to be finalised.

At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable.

The video featured Romero's own recollections, as well as those of id vets Tom Hall, John Carmack, and Adrian Carmack⁠—no relation on those last two, by the way. I only found that out embarrassingly recently. id began work on Catacomb 3-D in October 1991, after completing Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter⁠. This was during the studio's brief stint in Madison, Wisconsin after leaving Shreveport, Louisiana, but before settling in Texas for good. Catacomb 3-D was part of a deal id had with its founders' former employer, Softdisk. Some of id's first games⁠—made in blisteringly fast two-month development cycles until Wolfenstein 3-D ⁠—were distributed in Gamer's Edge, a monthly, subscription-based demo disk of games put out by the software company. Similar to shareware, it's a distribution model that sounds like it came from another universe looking back from 2026. Catacomb 3-D wasn't id's first FPS, but it included major advances over Hovertank One. While the crew continued to hone its art a…",

On Saturday, January 31, the game's official Discord was abuzz over rumored firings and resignations at Intrepid. Community lead Margaret Krohn revealed she had been laid off on LinkedIn, and in reply to a comment on the post, Krohn wrote : \"I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off.\" Intrepid founder and former creative director, Steven Sharif, offered more explanation in the face of the panic and speculation on the Discord server. \"I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,\" Sharif wrote. \"Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out.

That's almost as cheap as a crate full of puppets! That's thanks to a live Steam sale, which you can peruse at your leisure here if you're itching to figure out what all those Magic the Gathering cards are about. If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable. Fallout 3 and the Obsidian-developed New Vegas come after the series was bought from the original publisher, Interplay, by Bethesda. These 3D open-world RPGs are both widely celebrated…",

The news came in a statement on X where McFarlane stated, \"From March, server owners will be able to opt in and only allow connections to players who have Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 enabled … we’ll be reviewing the metrics and expect to move towards making this mandatory across all servers.\" He added that these requirements are \"increasingly standard\" in the competitive multiplayer space, which is true. Black Ops 7 went for it , and invasive anti-cheat strategies that get all up in your operating system's kernel-level business are as apparently effective as they are sometimes reviled , despite the occasional terrible mishap (like one case where Genshin Impact's kernel-level anti-cheat was leveraged to disable antivirus processes).
