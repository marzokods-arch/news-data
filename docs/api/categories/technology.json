    "body": "Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, a prolific character actor known to gamers for his portrayals of Mortal Kombat's evil sorcerer Shang Tsung, has died. A Variety report says Tagawa's death was the result of complications from a stroke he suffered on December 4. Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year. He turned up in everything from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Walker, Texas Ranger to Planet of…",

    "body": "As AI continues to balloon and pull in even more investment, one of the fiercest debates (other than copyright , ethics , and the environment ) is about whether or not it's a bubble. AMD's Lisa Su has weighed in on the debate. Recently, in an interview with Wired , the AMD chief was asked if she thought AI was a bubble. Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment. Investment is certainly there when it comes to AI. Nvidia is the first company to have been valued at $5 trillion . Nvidia, in turn, invested $100 billion into OpenAI back in S…",

His name is on the original Fallouts, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, and plenty else besides. Alas, he's been in a state of kind-of-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, and others, but generally contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote. So I'm not a contractor anymore.\" What's he working on? Well, wouldn't you like to know?…",
