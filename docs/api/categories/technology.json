It got a pretty big \"Cartel Update\" back in August and has now hit the Steam Autumn Sale with a juicy 30% discount. Despite the goofy-looking characters, we clocked early on that Schedule 1 isn't just a meme game and that it totally gets around the crafting game malaise by turning crafting into fun minigames . There's your free talking points for any friends who skipped the initial wave on this one who you may be able to twist into getting it on sale. It's me; I'm the friend in the group chat who missed it and is feeling a bit tempted by the discount. You can snag Schedule 1 on Steam for $14/£11.72 until the Autumn Sale closes next week on October 6, which isn't bargain bin but is a nice cut out of the $20 it normally goes for.

Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more.

During an interview on the BG2 podcast , a tech and investment focused bi-weekly program, the CEO of Nvidia echoed a sentiment similar to that of comments he made back in May of this year about how his company and the wider American tech industry needs to \"go compete\" in China. Huang emphasises, \"We’re up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor in China]\" (via Tom's Hardware ). These comments follow a podcast passage where Huang is generally complementary about the current US administration. Huang said, \"[President Trump] wants America to win the AI race. This is going to be a very long-term race, and he understands this is a pivotal time. He wants the technology industry to run. He wants everybody in the world to be built on American technology.\" But China has been busy, accelerating its own AI infrastructure plans with a reported mandate that its domestic data centres source at least 50% of their chips from similarly domestic manufacturers to avoid a reliance on US-made tech.

It. Her. I'll believe it when I see it.

Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally.
