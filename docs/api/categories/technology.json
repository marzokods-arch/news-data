    "body": "Hello Kitty Island Adventure is set to roll out Content Update 4 this month and, as announced to the official Discord server , a lot of exciting new stuff is coming. This will introduce new quests, visitors, furniture, and the most exciting part: at least two new avatars for your character. That's right, you're no longer limited to the set of animals you can pick from at the start of the game, we're getting a pair of amphibians. The two characters shown in the reveal are an axolotl and a frog, and much like every other critter you can pick as your playable character, you'll still be able to customise them with the colour palettes you've unlocked while exploring the island. Which is fantastic news as it'll take a lot for me to change my current pastel pink bunny. On the topic of customisation, a few of the patch notes also share that tweaks have been made to certain clothing items. Clipping issues for the Monster Beanie, Scholastic Berets, My Melody Pirate Hat, and the My Sweet Piano outfit have now been resolved, meaning no matter the shape of your character you'll be able to make the most of your wardrobe. There's nothing as disheartening as working for an outfit or accessory, an…",

Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September. Ever since the Last Epoch Kickstarter in 2018, EHG promised that once you buy the game, everything…",

The most popular ones simply won't work when Midnight arrives as part of Blizzard's plan to level the playing field for all players. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't gone over well with everyone. Some addon developers have called it quits , while others have expressed concerns over Blizzard's new rules. Professional world first raiders aren't sure what their jobs are going to look like in the next year and more casual players are worried their favorite classes are being over-simplified as a result. In a lengthy post about this new era of addon support, game director Ion Hazzikostas explains why any of this is happening now, what exactly is changing, and how things will move forward as the Midnight beta continues. \"We take none of this lightly,\" he says, adding that Blizzard has \"never designed [encounters] FOR addons,\" but it has \"inevitably had to design AROUND them for the past several expansions.\" Basically the problem was this: When a boss marks five players with ticking bombs, addons can just tell those people where…",

It might have taken the crown for the weirdest Windows quirk we've seen all year, but now we've had our fun, MS has squashed it—and I'm genuinely sad to see it go. According to the update page : \"This update addresses an issue where closing Task Manager with the Close button didn’t fully end the process, leaving background instances that could slow performance over time. This might occur after installing KB5067036.\" I was hoping for a more esoteric description, like \"Stopped Task Manager's transformation into an immortal self-replicating being, hole in universe now patched,\" but there we go. It's not the only small fix in the latest update, either, as MS has also stamped out an annoying-sounding Windows handheld issue: \"This update addresses an issue that affects gaming handheld devices. These devices were unable to stay in low-power states, which caused faster battery drain.\" I can't say we've run into that particular problem on the Windows handheld gaming PCs we've tested to da…",

The affected models are the DSL-AC51 , DSL-N16 , and DSL-AC750 , and here are links to the firmware you should install for each of these: DSL-AC51: firmware DSL-N16: firmware DSL-AC750: firmware The firmware you want is the latest one, version 1.1.2.3_1010. You download this firmware, and then upload it to your router's firmware upgrade page. For instance, for the AC51, after downloading and unzipping the file on a PC connected to the router, you go to your router's administration page and navigate to Advanced Settings > Administration > Firmware Upgrade, then select Browse in the New Firmware File field, and click Upload. It will reboot when it's done. The particular Asus router pictured here and at the top of this article is no…",

It didn't work out so well back then, but this time , I think Valve has a real shot at finally decoupling a respectable chunk of PC gaming from Windows, if not the entire saucer section. Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One. Manufacturers started putting Windows on them to get them out the door. \"Nobody …",
