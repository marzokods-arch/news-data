The issue particularly affects those running Android 16 QPR3 beta. While Google has acknowledged the issue and claimed to fix it with the latest beta last week, the issue still persists. When Google pushed out the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update for Pixel 6 and newer devices last week, it shared a long list of fixes that the update brought. The changelog also mentioned that the issue of Microsoft apps randomly crashing on previous versions was also fixed. Despite this, however, several users have reported that the issues still persist. That could be frustrating, especially as Google endorses Android QPR beta updates — unlike the pre-release betas — fit for regular use. A large number of reports on the Android beta subreddit, as well as Google’s Issue Tracker, still echo that the bug hasn’t been fixed even after Google claims it has been. The degree to which it affects different people varies, though. For some, only certain Microsoft apps, such as Teams, crash abruptly, while for some others, it’s a larger mix of apps.

Some even use that data to train their AI models, and all of them are required to hand over data to the government when asked. Your email should be your business. Period.

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

While the exact nature of the device remains unknown, various hypotheses have emerged. For instance, a leaker last year suggested it could be an audio device shaped like a pen , while a more recent leak indicated it would be a pair of earphones with a previously unseen design .

    "body": "Credit: realme TL;DR Realme is launching the P4 Power with a massive 10,001mAh “Titan” battery. The company claims its Titan battery can deliver a week of power on a single charge. Realme says the battery uses advanced safety and longevity tech to slow wear and stay stable over time. For quite some time now, 5,000mAh has been the standard for smartphone batteries, often leaving users to carry battery banks or use a low-power mode. Now, realme is changing things by launching a smartphone with a huge 10,001 mAh battery, rather than just showing off a concept or a lab prototype. The main feature here is realme’s Titan battery, a 10,001mAh cell that the company says can last a week. The number stands out, but what’s more impressive is how fast realme turned the idea into a real product. After showing a 10,000mAh concept phone last year, the company has now started mass-producing the 10,001mAh battery.",

The change affects the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 15 and could soon roll out to older devices and OxygenOS builds as well. OnePlus has reportedly started making a major behind-the-scenes change that could permanently affect bootloader unlocking, custom ROMs, and even basic software downgrades on its phones. The company had previously announced a new system that would limit bootloader unlocking, and it looks like it’s finally starting to implement it.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus might finally fix the disappointing aspect of its flagships. It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually, Google backed down and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Update: January 18, 2026 (11:18 PM ET): After publication, we heard from Marc Prud’hommeaux, the founder of the App Fair Project and an F-Droid board member, who pointed out that the warning strings we referenced are not entirely new to Android. Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development. The move from system-level code to Google Play could signal that the company is actively preparing to surface this flow to users. Still, Google has yet to clearly explain how its promised “advanced” sideloading path will work in practice. Until the c…",

Big points if you remember that the HUAWEI Mate 10’s Kirin 970 processor was the first, though similar ideas had been floating around, particularly in imaging, before then. Of course, a lot has changed in the last eight years — Apple has finally embraced AI, albeit with mixed results, and Google has obviously leaned heavily into its Tensor Processor Unit for everything from imaging to on-device language translation. Ask any of the big tech companies, from Arm and Qualcomm to Apple and Samsung, and they’ll all tell you that AI is the future of smartphone hardware and software.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Netflix hasn’t said why it decided to end casting support, but a new report points to falling usage. One streaming exec says only about 10% of Android users still cast content. Casting still matters to some people, but Netflix no longer seems to see it as essential. Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",
