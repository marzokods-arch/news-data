So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate. To make amends with folks who tried and failed to complete the Expedition last time, Embark is also introducing a \"catchup mechanic\" that will allow players to earn last season's five skill points on the cheap: (I…",

Logitech's G522 Lightspeed is almost certainly a lightweight breathable headset, but with enough give to feel like it could survive a toss without breaking down into (admittedly very pretty) dust. With an included 2.4 GHz wireless receiver and intuitive Bluetooth mode, the G522 Lightspeed can be set up in seconds. It feels comfortable wrapped around the ears. The cushioned pads are spongy and airy, with enough padding, but not so much that you can't hit the frame with your finger with a press. The cups grip just enough to clamp onto the head without adding clamminess in the process. That comfort is enhanced by an adjustable headband sitting just below the plastic shell of the top of the headset. Unfortunately, that band only has two adjustable holes on either side, meaning there are only three adjustment settings total.

Of course, there will also be banter between our hosts, deep dives that take you behind the scenes of some of our most hotly anticipated games, and more world premieres than you can shake a stick at. Please don't actually shake any sticks at them, though, they're skittish. In the crowded sea of summer showcases, the PC Gaming Show stands out from the pack as the only one made by PC Gamers, for PC gamers. FPS, RPG, RTS, any acronym you can think of, there will probably be a game of that genre in our line-up. And if there isn't, you can send a pigeon to our complaints department.

In an email interview with PC Gamer, Nioh 3 director Masaki Fujita said the threequel incorporates lessons learned from the ARPGs Koei Tecmo has released since Nioh 2. But Nioh 3 wasn't only informed by Team Ninja's own work. According to Fujita, Neowiz's Pinocchio soulslike Lies of P was a source of creative inspiration for Nioh 3's boss and combat design. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) When asked how player reactions to Koei Tecmo's recent soulslike and ARPG releases influenced Nioh 3, Fujita said 2023's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty underscored that, while loot is a key part of Nioh's appeal, \"there's a need to control the complexity of the game.\" Likewise, he noted that some players felt the relationship between Wo Long's protagonist and their counterpart in the Blindfolded Boy was underdeveloped, leading Team Ninja to \"go into more depth\" with how co…",

Though the Superstrike goes one further with haptic feedback, too. I got my hands on the mouse recently and I'm really impressed . However, it's not a cheap thing. It's set to launch on February 10 for $180 / £160 , which is even a little more expensive than the very expensive Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro , the best gaming mouse currently on the market. And given the Superstrike is aimed at competitive gameplay, I do worry that the advantage it gives might be restricted to only the very few who can afford it. Thankfully, though, while visiting its Swiss labs, Logitech helped somewhat quell my concerns on this front. Of course, the price tag for the Supestrike is what it is, but this is bleeding-edge tech, and it will hopefully become cheaper to implement, or be used in cheaper products in time.

Logitech's X2 Superstrike is the first serious effort to bring such tech to a gaming mouse, and now that I've had my mitts all over it here at Logitech's Swiss labs, I reckon it stands a chance of shoving the esports scene forwards as Hall effect did with keyboards.

The mouse uses what Logitech is calling a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS), ie, a mix of haptic feedback and inductive tech for the LMB and RMB switches.

I found it impossible not to make mental comparisons to Elden Ring as I slaughtered yokai or fell to their savage attacks. But rather than feel the impulse to pit them against each other, I found myself appreciating their differences—a multitude of them, some vast—and how both games complement each other. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo) Elden Ring's open worlds, divided into the Lands Between and the Land of Shadow (from the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion) represent a singular open-world design philosophy, one that rejects the traditional approach typified by the likes of Assassin's Creed.

Because it never got made it can stay perfect in our imaginations, never having to live up to reality. That doesn't stop modders from wanting to make it real in their own ways, though. There's a mod to recreate Van Buren in Fallout 2's engine called Fallout Yesterday , and a project that's supposedly remaking the whole game as it would have been . However, since a bunch of ideas from Van Buren were eventually re-used in Fallout: New Vegas—like Caesar's Legion, the Big MT, and Joshua Graham—you can see why there would be an advantage in remaking Van Buren as a mod for the game that already has some of the relevant assets.

Only 15% of respondents said they weren't interested in AI-enabled devices because the technology seems too complicated. That seemingly puts the lie to the idea that consumers are rejecting AI because it hasn't been explained to them clearly enough, presumably slowly and with small words.

Nioh 3 is more frenetic than Nioh 2, which was more frenetic than Nioh. Team Ninja's project feels akin to id Software's approach with Doom Eternal: no finger can be permitted to rest. It's a project in pushing against the limits of player exhaustion. After 20 hours I still don't understand all the systems in Nioh 3, but there's one I'm already super familiar with from past Nioh games: pressing RB to perform a \"ki pulse\" after every attack.

Some think it's an extremely important character indeed: Courier 6, the actual character we all play in Fallout: New Vegas. It's not a bad theory.

    "body": "Bethesda veteran and Skyrim lead designer Bruce Nesmith has done a new interview with PressBoxPR going over his considerable time at the studio: among the topics addressed are why Bethesda shouldn't switch to Unreal Engine , Todd Howard's \" seagulling \" habits, and one bit of deep cut lore that had PCG's Joshua Wolens despairing . Nesmith is asked at one point about the debate over $100 games, which has been going on for years now but feels especially acute in the year of our lord Grand Theft Auto 6, which some expect to set a new premium price point. The argument is that spiralling budgets and the relatively steady price of games over the years makes such an increase inevitable , and perhaps even essential to the industry's future well-being. \"I remember for 15 years, the price of a newly released game was $59.95,\" says Nesmith. \"For 15 years, it didn't change. Not even a cost of living increase. Not even recognizing inflation. It stayed at that price point. The fact that the prices are going up, I can't fault them for that. \"But I don't think players look at the hours of experience per price of the title once it gets past a certain number. There's going to be savvy players who d…",

    "body": "The last thing I expected Blizzard to do was to change the name of Overwatch 2 back to just \"Overwatch\" four years after it came out. But as announced during the recent Spotlight video, that is exactly what Blizzard's doing. Most of the sequel's life has been about earning that 2 , so why change it now? The reason, as Blizzard explained to PC Gamer and other press attending an event at its offices in Irvine last week, is all about the development team's confidence in Overwatch's future. Starting next week, Overwatch is going to look a lot different—literally, with a new UI, five new heroes, and the kick off of a whole new storyline. Its 21st season—coming February 10—will instead be known as season 1 of The Reign of Talon, a year-long narrative that will be told through in-game events, cinematics, short stories, and comics. It's a season that game director Aaron Keller calls \"the biggest launch we've ever had in Overwatch's history.\" To communicate how much of a shakeup this new era of Overwatch will be, the 2 had to go, franchise general manager and head of live service and mobile games Walter Kong said. \"Something that we've talked about internally at the team as a stretch goal …",
