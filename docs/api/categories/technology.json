    "body": "Training an AI model to predict equipment failures is an engineering achievement. But it&#8217;s not until prediction meets action—the moment that model successfully flags a malfunctioning machine—that true business transformation occurs. One technical milestone lives in a proof-of-concept deck; the other meaningfully contributes to the bottom line. Craig Partridge, senior director worldwide of Digital Next Advisory at HPE, believes &#8220;the true value of AI lies in inference”. Inference is where AI earns its keep. It’s the operational layer that puts all that training to use in real-world workflows. Partridge elaborates, &#8220;The phrase we use for this is &#8216;trusted AI inferencing at scale and in production,'&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we think the biggest return on AI investments will come from.&#8221; Getting to that point is difficult. Christian Reichenbach, worldwide digital advisor at HPE, points to findings from the company&#8217;s recent survey of 1,775 IT leaders: While nearly a quarter (22%) of organizations have now operationalized AI—up from 15% the previous year—the majority remain stuck in experimentation. Reaching the next stage requires a thr…",

    "body": "Google today unveiled Gemini 3, a major upgrade to its flagship multimodal model. The firm says the new model is better at reasoning, has more fluid multimodal capabilities (the ability to work across voice, text or images), and will work like an agent.&nbsp; The previous model, Gemini 2.5, supports multimodal input. Users can feed it images, handwriting, or voice. But it usually requires explicit instructions about the format the user wants back, and it defaults to plain text regardless.&nbsp; But Gemini 3 introduces what Google calls “generative interfaces,” which allow the model to make its own choices about what kind of output fits the prompt best, assembling visual layouts and dynamic views on its own instead of returning a block of text.&nbsp; Ask for travel recommendations and it may spin up a website-like interface inside the app, complete with modules, images, and follow-up prompts such as “How many days are you traveling?” or “What kinds of activities do you enjoy?” It also presents clickable options based on what you might want next.

What is the chance your plane will be hit by space debris? The risk of flights being hit by space junk is still small, but it’s growing. About three pieces of old space equipment —used rockets and defunct satellites—fall into Earth’s atmosphere every day, according to estimates by the European Space Agency. By the mid-2030s, there may be dozens thanks to the rise of megaconstellations in orbit. So far, space debris hasn’t injured anybody—in the air or on the ground. But multiple close calls have been reported in recent years. But some estimates have the risk of a single human death or injury caused by a space debris strike on the ground at around 10% per year by 2035. That would mean a better than even chance that someone on Earth would be hit by space junk about every decade.

In mid-October, a mysterious object cracked the windshield of a packed Boeing 737 cruising at 36,000 feet above Utah, forcing the pilots into an emergency landing. The internet was suddenly buzzing with the prospect that the plane had been hit by a piece of space debris. We still don’t know exactly what hit the plane—likely a remnant of a weather balloon—but it turns out the speculation online wasn’t that far-fetched. That’s because while the risk of flights being hit by space junk is still small, it is, in fact, growing.&nbsp; About three pieces of old space equipment —used rockets and defunct satellites—fall into Earth’s atmosphere every day, according to estimates by the European Space Agency.

Why it matters: It’s a big deal, because today’s LLMs are black boxes: Nobody fully understands how they do what they do. Building a model that is more transparent sheds light on how LLMs work in general, helping researchers figure out why models hallucinate, why they go off the rails, and just how far we should trust them with critical tasks.

And drug tests in dogs and nonhuman primates will be reduced by 2030.&nbsp; The news follows similar moves by other countries. In April, the US Food and Drug Administration announced&nbsp; a plan to replace animal testing for monoclonal antibody therapies with “more effective, human-relevant models.” And, following a workshop in June 2024, the European Commission also began working on&nbsp; a “road map” to phase out animal testing for chemical safety assessments .
