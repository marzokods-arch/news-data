If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about 3 hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabian, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reasons).…",

But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument.

The benefits for the two companies are clear enough. Nvidia needs processors for GPU-accelerated server racks, and despite its best efforts to buy Arm, that fell through, dashing any hope of becoming a fully-integrated hardware company with it. Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways. The company is struggling with a falling share price and recently struck a deal with the US government to buy a share of the business, and getting an in with one of the richest companies on the planet isn't a bad get. Though supercharging its processors with more capable and powerful graphics chips has a few big benefits, too. To some degree in gaming, sure, but mostly AI. \"I think these are going to be revolutionary products.

In a press conference yesterday evening, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang firmly stated that the Trump administration \"had no involvement in this partnership at all\", but there's evidence to suggest this may not be entirely the case. The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news. Writing on Substack, US semiconductor industry analyst Alex_Intel notes that Intel's chief financial officer stated that the company wasn't seeking any more stake sales at a recent Goldman Sachs conference.

Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU. That honour used to go to Intel's Core i5 13400F , but no longer, as AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is the sensible choice. (Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option. It's faster in games, and because it uses AMD's AM5 processor socket, you get far superior upgrade options.

An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node.

    "body": "So Intel and Nvidia dropped a CPU-GPU bomb earlier today, announcing a distinctly unexpected plan to collab' on new computing products based on Intel's x86 CPUs and Nvidia's GPUs . Oh, and there's the minor matter of Nvidia investing $5 billion in Intel. But what will these unholy Intel-Nvidia chips look like? For now, there are virtually no official details, though we might get more this evening in the dual-CEO presser with Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang . But there's an existing chip that might just give some very important hints of what to expect. I speak of the so-called GB10 \"Superchip\" . GB10 is also a collaboration between Nvidia and another chip maker, though in this particular case, it's Mediatek and an Arm rather than an x86 CPU. However, it sports several details that immediately ring a bell in the context of the announced Intel-Nvidia deal. In today's press release , there was a broad reference to Nvidia's high-bandwidth, low-latency NvLink interface being a critical part of the technological tie-up. Meanwhile, the consumer PC part of the deal was described as \"x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide rang…",

    "body": "I scour Reddit and support forums pretty regularly, and it's not exactly rare to see people complaining about systems or peripherals from specific brands. But it's often difficult to know whether those issues are widespread enough to designate a problem with those devices in particular. It doesn't seem like that's the case here, though, as Github user Zephkek seems to have found issues specifically with Asus laptop firmware (via Reddit ). I contacted Asus about this yesterday and am still waiting to hear back for more details, but in the meantime Asus ROG has released a statement on X explaining that its \"team is actively investigating these cases.\" The \"cases\" in question are \"performance interruptions on some ROG laptops,\" which Zephkek's Github analysis details. Your feedback has been heard 🤝 pic.twitter.com/2UxWiQB1KX September 17, 2025 It seems that some Asus ROG laptop owners have been experiencing stutters, freezes, and audio crackles. And apparently the problem is \"embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.\" LatencyMon tests on different Asus ROG laptops showed that lag was being caused by ACPI.sys, but only on a single core. The investigator explains: \"[ACPI.sys] prim…",

What you've made here is an AI-powered Tribble , and now those of us in the US and the UK can pick one up for $429 / £369 . The once-Japan-only device is said to be many things, including a calming presence, a quiet reassurance, and something that \"responds, understands, and grows with you.\" Essentially, it's an AI trapped inside a cuddly robotic fursuit, and one that Casio seems to think is perfect for stress relief ( via Digital Trends ). The Moflin is capable of moving and tilting its head, responding to light and touch, and listening to your darkest fantas... I mean, your vocalisations through a built-in microphone. Not only that, but it'll adjust its behaviour based on an AI-powered emotional spectrum, which Casio says allows it to \"express a diverse range of feelings.\" It can be grumpy, thrilled, joyful, anxious, lonely, calm, happy... in fact, it sounds like a right needy little git, and that's apparently part of the appeal.
