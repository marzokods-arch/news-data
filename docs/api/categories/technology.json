    "body": "Intel recently spilled the beans on its upcoming Panther Lake CPU architecture , which seems to be an iterative improvement over previous designs, plus the promise of being built on a new process node, 18A. But in case you've wondered about some of the broader design choices that went into the last couple of generations plus the upcoming one, Intel's just answered why these CPU cores are the way they are. Well, at least in one respect, that is, this is being why simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was abandoned. In a recent interview with Chips and Cheese , Intel's lead x86 CPU architect Stephen Robinson tells interviewer George Cozma that \"SMT isn't necessarily as valuable\" once you add hybrid cores into the mix. Intel has been using hybrid cores—a mix of P-Cores for heavy workloads and E-Cores for lighter ones—for the past few years, ever since 12th Gen Alder Lake processors. Initially, these had multithreading. But the most recent Lunar Lake mobile and Alder Lake desktop chips—the first ones other than Meteor Lake to use the 'Core Ultra' nomenclature—ditched SMT altogether. This trend is continuing with upcoming Panther Lake processors: they won't have SMT. Robinson explains that…",

If you loved games like the original Baldur’s Gate , Icewind Dale, or Planescape, and also wondered why we stopped seeing these kinds of titles for a bit there, well it turns out you can blame physical retailers for the decline in Dungeons-and-Dragons-style PC RPGs. The Infinity Engine was used to power isometric roleplaying games like the ones above. It allowed game devs to take many of the sentiments and mechanics used in DnD and translate them to videogame experiences. It allowed a lot of people to have these kinds of adventures for the first time, especially when good Dungeon Masters are always so hard to find. \"The reason we stopped making Infinity Engine games was because retailers told us no one wanted to buy them,\" says Josh Sawyer—who now serves as Obsidian's studio design director but cut his teeth working on games like Icewind Dale—during his keynote speech at GCAP 2025 in Melbourne, Australia. \"We asked if we could see the research and they basically told us to trust them\" he adds to sad chuckles from the crowd.…",

AI code review platform Graphite has published a blog detailing its use of \"dogfooding\" to help develop its onboarding process, a particularly ugly term that apparently equates to \"being forced to eat your own dogfood\" . Essentially, you make the product, you should be forced to use it—which Graphite apparently enacts by randomly deleting employee accounts on a daily basis, a process it refers to as \"onboarding roulette\". The facepalms, they are not big enough. Anyway, the whole idea is to test the onboarding process for its AI code review software, a traditionally difficult problem to solve due to the userbase being your primary test subjects. Fear not, however, as apparently dogfooding is the way forward. As co-founder and CTO Greg Foster explains: \"Our solution at Graphite has been to run a roulette script, randomly deleting one of our engineers' Graphite accounts every day at 9 a.m. We don’t just reset onboarding—we delete their account, tokens, configured filters, uploaded gifs, and more.\" \"Isn't that frustrating? Sure.\" continues Foster. \"Folks on our team come to work …",

Although you won't see GenAI-made content in BF6, Coutaz does say the tech is used in prep stages of development \"to allow more time and more space to be creative\". It's not just you, I'm not sure what the substance of that statement is either, though Coutaz does say there's not really a way to integrate the tech into devs' day-to-day just yet (it's perhaps interesting to note, here, a recent bit of research by the FT which found that many businesse…",

The United Arab Emirates may just sit on that pile alongside it, according to recent agreements.

The Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security reportedly issued a license to Nvidia to export chips, but the specific number of processors has not yet been announced. The US was previously in talks to approve up to 100,000 chips a year to the UAE, but that number jumped up to 500,000 a year until 2027, after talks. The current figure of exported chips under the new license has not been disclosed.

During my many hours putting Battlefield 6 through its paces in early access, I had the chance to face off against and team up with content creators and other journalists. That's cool and all, but some of the most fun I had was against Battlefield 6's bots. Not because they're incredibly easy to farm for kills (though that's also true), but because they're so…interesting. It's hard to truly grasp just how dumb BF6's AI-controlled bots really are, and that's a shame because you're unlikely to ever witness it for yourself outside of the campaign. These bots only ever joined in on the action whenever the server couldn't be fully populated by real players. During a limited review period, that's an inevitability. Once Battlefield 6 is in the wild, chances are we'll never see these bots in their natural habitat ever again (outside of Portal, I suppose).

Think of getaways as an extra layer of customization that merges travel and generic lots, but instead of trusting your sims to roam free, you can give them a to-do list that they'll (usually) follow. Your sims can fill roles you design and specify, or the game can supplement gaps with random assignments.

But regional pricing on Steam supports an awful lot of other currencies, allowing for local costs that are, ideally, better for consumers in other parts of the world than converting to US dollars. In reality, though, the system works out better for some gamers than others: Some regional prices end up being cheaper than a converted price, but others can be significantly more expensive. The price of Battlefield 6 in Chinese yuan, for instance, is ¥268 according to SteamDB , which works out to a little under $38, quite a discount on its $70 price in the US; at the other end of the scale, though, are gamers in Israel, who are going to have to fork over 299 new shekels, which converts to nearly $92.

The company behind the game has now announced Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke , a special edition where every card explains why it is funny. The reason? This makes it an \"informational product\" rather than a game, meaning it is \"100% EXEMPT FROM DONALD TRUMP’S STUPID TARIFFS!\" I'm going to warn you in advance, in case it's not clear, that the people behind this really don't like Donald Trump. So read on at your own risk. \"Trump is Going to Fuck Christmas\" opens the announcement, before going on to explain that \"like a teen girl at a beauty pageant, Christmas is in grave danger because of Donald Trump. \"In stores across America, the price of toys, games, clothes, and food are skyrocketing, all thanks to our demented president and his dumbass tariffs. But what if you didn’t have to surrender a chunk of your Christmas budget to Trump and…",

Torbjörn, Hazard, and Sojourn will be joining Stadium for Season 19 alongside the new Busan Sanctuary Control Map. But I'm not that bothered about the new heroes, although I'm sure Sojourn will be an absolute horror to play against—instead, I'm more interested in the structural changes. (Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment) \"Armory is getting upgraded for all of your inventory indexing needs,\" an official blog post says. \"Items and Builds will have dedicated sub-tabs, filters, and faster search tools. The Advanced Info Panel is to be fully integrated into Stadium as well, so you’ll see exactly how your chosen Items and Powers alter your weapons and abilities in raw, terrifying numbers. We want to remove the mystery from your stats.\" Getting the option to see how much damage each hit deals isn't made to make you feel bad—it's actually a great change that'll let players see how their perks are performing. \"You’ll be able to view your damage and healing numbers floa…",

    "body": "According to a Chinese analyst group called the XR Research Institute, Upload VR reports , Valve Deckard is set to ship at the end of this year during the holiday season. Mass production has apparently begun, and 400,000–600,000 units are expected per year. Deckard, for those unaware, is Valve's long-, long-, long -anticipated VR headset that's expected to be a standalone device not requiring PC power, unlike the Valve Index . We first caught wind of it back in June 2022, thanks to a December 2021 patent application . Since then, we've had rumour after rumour, including that 'Roy' controllers for Deckard were being tooled last year, that Valve was importing VR manufacturing equipment into the US earlier this year , and that some influencers recently travelled to Seattle and were a little cryptic about it. It's one of those things that has been on the cards for such a long time that it has somehow seemed to be imminently approaching, and yet also a little like a fable we'll never see the real sight of.
