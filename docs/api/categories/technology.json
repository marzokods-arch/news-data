Exoskeleton maker Dnsys is the partner in this enterprise and worked with Kojima Productions art director Yoji Shinkawa on the design. The exoskeleton is based on an existing Dnsys model but altered to fit the Death Stranding aesthetic, with things like lights that show the battery level dotted on the frame. \"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,\" says Shinkawa . \"Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear. Wearing it feels as if the world of Death Stranding has come to life, where imagination and reality finally connect.\" Then we get to the claims of what this thing does. Forget about your useless old bones because this baby offloads up to 200% of the wearer's body weight from the knees. Erm… 200%? Don't th…",

So much that it's often overwhelming and confusing, leading you to lug back a rucksack full of junk, hoping that at least something in it will come in handy. Simply put, I got fed up and decided to get to the root of the issue; I jotted down all 62 unique items I needed to find for quests, Scrappy and workshop upgrades, and the Expedition Project , which adds up to a staggering 1,195 materials you need to haul back to Speranza. Here's hoping my math skills haven't let me down. Nevertheless, in tallying this all up, I noticed a few interesting things. Firstly, you need to loot the drivers of every single Arc robot in the game right now besides a Queen. As you'd imagine, you generally need more of the basic Arcs' parts compared to the tougher ones, though you need six Bastion and Bombardier Cells, six Surveyor Vaults, and eight Leaper Pulse Units. I think it's safe to say we all hate fighting Leapers , and Surveyor drones are so skittish that they're hard to actually put down. So, if you get any of these items before their relevant upgrade task, hang on to them, or y…",

Patent Result values a company's quality over quantity and the strength of the ideas being brought to the table, so the ranking is based on both \"the quantity and relevance of their patents\". How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company.

One of my favourite spots is in the Raider Outposts in Dam Battlegrounds. There'll usually be great loot in there as is, some blankets or medical supplies, alongside crafting materials and sometimes a gun case just sitting on the ground floor of the Outpost. Then there's a ladder outside leading to the roof, where there'll occasionally be some crates to break into. But the best place in the Raider Outposts to loot is actually in the ceiling.

Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator.

The tunnel is a little ways off to the side of the balcony, explaining why this might be tripping you up. So, here's how to complete Water Troubles in Arc Raiders. Locate the Flood Access Tunnel under the Red Lake Balcony You can find the Flood Access Tunnel pipe directly to the east of the Control Tower on the basin floor (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step is pretty straightforward; you'll want to head into the big basin area in the east of the Dam Battlegrounds map—be careful if the Harvester event is active, because this is where the queen likes to patrol. You're looking for a big open pipe directly to the east of the Control Tower , built into the lower part of the dam. If…",

    "body": "REPO launched its monster update on October 31 , adding ten new horrifying beasts to the already tense game. However, even though players are still mastering the art of dodging the Birthday Boy's balloons and outrunning the Loom, semiwork has already uploaded a video to YouTube sharing that preparations for the game's next update are underway. With that said, there is no information regarding its contents, or when to expect it. Only that there will be another update in due course. In fact, the video opens the floor to players to share what they'd like to see when REPO receives its next drop rather than the decision being down to the devs. Since we've just received a fresh batch of monsters, I can't imagine we'll be getting any new creatures any time soon, but a lot of people are keen to see new locations over anything else. As part of the monster update, REPO received a bunch of new valuables too, each corresponding to their location rather than being a random selection available through each map. So I don't doubt a new location would inevitably result in more valuable variation. However it seems like a huge number of players would like some sort of progression as well, rather tha…",

For your second phase of Expedition prep, building whatever the hell that thing is the game has you gathering materials for, you'll need five cooling fans. That's quite a few rare materials, especially if you don't know where to find them.

Arc Raiders cooling fan location You most often find cooling fans inside these breachable cabinets in Technological areas (Image credit: Embark Studios) You can find cooling fans in marked Technological areas in Arc Raiders, but just searching through every container won't help you. You'll want to breach and search the big cabinets of electrical machinery , pictured above, since these generally contain cooling fans, or at least have a chance to.
