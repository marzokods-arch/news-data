Anyway, this is all to say that I think the most recent update to the Steam client—itself essentially a packaging of a bunch of fixes that have been pushed to Steam's beta branch recently—is, stealthily, very much about prepping for Valve's black box. I say this because Steam's January 21 client update practically vibrates with controller fixes and updates. Support for the Nintendo Switch 2 wired controller has been re-enabled, there are new settings for joystick responses, fixes for gyro aiming, and plenty else besides (find the full list down below). You ask me, that looks like Valve getting its input ducks in a row ahead of the release of its living room box, though it's far from the only set of fixes wrapped up in thi…",

Simply asking a teammate to change off Black Widow and to pick a character better suited for the comp they were likely about to come up against. And may I just add that Kingsman asked very nicely as well, much nicer than I would have if there was prize money on the line. The response to his request wasn't as nice, though. The team lead, Cece, alongside the Widow main Zazza, and Kingsman's duo Luci, piled on him, making fun of the fact that he wanted to try in the tournament and then attacking his character in now leaked messages.

According to CFO, David Zinsner, the company has dodged the worst of the ongoing memory crisis by being \"relatively aggressive\" in securing memory for the mobile chip. \"I think we've got what we need based on the current forecast,\" Zinsner says. \"Of course, that could always tick up, and then we would need more memory which would kind of impact gross margins. But we were relatively aggressive in terms of getting the memory early\" (transcript via SeekingAlpha ). Lunar Lake is particularly at-risk from the ongoing memory crisis, which has seen memory in tight supply and prices skyrocket, due to its use of on-package memory. Take a look at the package and you can see two LPDDR5X chips nestled besides the processor. This has benefits for efficiency and size, but has caused some headaches for Intel. One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips. As such, Lunar Lake has not offered the sort of margins that Intel would like, and buying more memory at today's prices would make matters worse. \"Th…",

Until now, that is: a second Armored Core game just released on Steam courtesy of Japanese publisher G-Mode, and it's going for the bargain price of $11. Alas, Armored Core: Mobile 3 is not likely an instalment the masses will embrace. It was originally released for flip phones in 2007, and further complicating matters, it was a Japanese exclusive. While that's not exactly the case now—you can easily go and buy Armored Core: Mobile 3 on Steam right now—few will have the patience to play it without English subs. Indeed, no major efforts have been made to modernize this ancient artefact, though it does appear to have controller support. Here's the trailer: If that's not enough to discourage you, it's pretty cool to have this curio made available again. It takes place between Armored Core Nexus and Armored Core Last Raven, both of which were offshoots of Armored Core 3.

A reviewer by the name of Bad Wolf kicked off the bit about a month ago, saying that while \"everything is great\" about the hotel, \"the only issue is that players sometimes spawn just 10 meters away from me.\" In the weeks since, all but one review—left by guests who enjoyed a \"ski-related stay\"—have been Arc Raiders references, ranging from the simple \"Hey, Raider!
