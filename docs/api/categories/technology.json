Google built the Universal Commerce Protocol with input from major players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair, with more than 20 partners already signed on. The new “Business Agents” also let brands answer shopper questions in conversational results using their own product knowledge. Imagine asking your phone for new running shoes, and instead of just getting links, an AI finds and buys them for you, so you don’t have to switch between tabs. That future is now much closer. Google has unveiled a new open-standard framework that aims to make autonomous, AI-led shopping a real part of how we buy things online. At the center of this change is a protocol called Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP). It serves as a common language, enabling AI agents to connect with retailers, payment systems, and shopping platforms without requiring custom connections.",

Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer.

Honestly, it probably deserves most of it — a physical keyboard with a fingerprint reader hidden in the spacebar is a cool design. It wasn’t much of a surprise, though, as we’d heard rumblings about big things out of Clicks leading up to the show. However, as I wandered the show floor on my last day in Las Vegas, I stumbled upon another tiny little Android device, and I think it might have stolen some of the Communicator’s thunder. It’s called the Ikko MindOne, and it’s exactly the type of quirky little device I love to find at CES .",

And that’s exactly what I’ll be doing this year when it comes to the apps and services I use. I regularly use several of them, but it’s time to make changes for two reasons. The first is that some of these apps simply don’t serve me anymore, whether due to a lack of functionality or a price point that’s become too high. The second is that switching to a new app I’ll use regularly is actually a fun process for me. It gives me that boost of energy I need to kick off the year on the right note.",
