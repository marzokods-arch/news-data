When the deadline mine was first introduced into Arc Raiders, it created new opportunities for players to take out large arcs like Rocketeers or Bastions in one hit, provided they could get close enough to actually attach the mine first. But now players are taking it one step further, and attaching not only deadline mines to arcs but also fireworks with them. (Image credit: Embark) \"I thought it would be possible, so I tried\" were the words uttered by an ingenious Arc Raiders player.

The company's statement to its investors clarifies that this includes an existing 300 mm wafer cleanroom measuring 300,000 square feet, though none of the production equipment contained therein. In total, it's a deal to the tune of $1.8 billion that will encompass more than facilities, with Micron also hoping to establish a long-term business relationship with PSMC. This latest announcement follows recent comments from Micron's VP of Marketing, Christopher Moore, that \" there's just not enough supply to go around .\" However, while this eye-watering transaction is expected to complete during the second quarter of 2026, with Micron assuming control of the fab immediately after, the site isn't expected to contribute meaningfully to DRAM wafer output until the latter half of 2027.

That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6.

We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped.

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success. In a Steam post , Kira issued an update on the expansion's progress: \"I am still working on the DLC, it's about 70% done (I feel like it's been at 70% forever though). I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year.

Under the forensic eye of PC gaming's modding community, however, nothing remains hidden for long. Over the last few years, The Witcher 3 mega-mod Brothers in Arms has restored hundreds of these cut lines (alongside other features like missing NPCs, restored books and journal entries). Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish. It revolves around a dialogue choice for Geralt where he chooses whether to say \"I love you\" to Yennefer. In the original version, if he chooses not to sa…",

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo.
