As noted last week by PC Gamer's Andy Edser, the Windows team recently stamped out a bug that granted Task Manager immortality . The sadly now mortal Task Manager has also suffering from an indignity for months that I have only just noticed: a crappy, Windows 11-ified icon. I am generally ambivalent about Windows 11's aesthetic. The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules. Firebending seems like an obvious one. Magic's already got fireballs. But firebending is more than just a spicy ranged attack—it's the one variety of bending where you don't need to have the element at hand. While airbenders have it easy because the…",

I've been an energy drink fiend since high school—a fact that I'm neither proud nor ashamed of—but Monster was never a favorite. CoD season used to be the only time I'd pick up a can or two, but that changed this year when I switched to zero sugar drinks and discovered the Monster Zero Ultra line is one of the only bubbly energy options that doesn't taste like medicine. Lately I've been all about the watermelon flavor. And that's exactly the can I planned to pick up at my corner store yesterday to score some meaningless Black Ops 7 goodies.

But the final result didn't live up to that early promise: In a message posted to Steam, Pahto Labs said Starlight Re:Volver's failure was largely due to the underwhelming quality of the game. \"We had ambitious goals of making a bustling social hub with a robust roguelite gameplay system, but we spread ourselves too thin,\" the studio wrote. \"Our sales numbers are a reflection that the game wasn’t fun enough to sustain a consistent, healthy player bas…",

But it's still making corrections before that, too, and interested run-and-gunners will have a chance to check out the latest updates in another round of playtesting set for December. Unlike the recently concluded October playtest, which was open to players in North America and Europe, this one in December will be accessible only to those in North America. Otherwise, it looks to be pretty much the same deal, including that it's invite-only, invitations cannot be shared, and the whole thing is \"strictly under an NDA,\" meaning you can't stream it or \"share your playtest experience publicly.\" That strikes me as not great. PC Gamer's senior video producer Scott Tanner just broke it to me that March 2026 isn't much more than three months away, and maybe I'm being a little alarmist but Bungie maintaining such a tight lid on Marathon at this late stage seems discomfitingly cautious for a game that was meant to be Bungie's next big thing.

The researchers from the University of Vienna (via The Register ) say that the data acquired would, \"to our knowledge, classify as the largest data leak in history, had it not been collated as part of a responsibly-conducted research study.\" But this \"leak\" may not quite be what it seems. The researchers claim to have scraped phone numbers, timestamps, \"about\" text, profile pictures, and public keys for E2EE encryption, the release of which, \"would entail adverse implications to the included users.\" So, what exactly is going on here and if you use WhatsApp do you need to be worried? This research relies on the fact that WhatsApp allows some user details to be acquired by inputting phone numbers. That includes the profile photos already mentioned. However, the key point is that users can opt to keep most of that data and profile images either entirely private or restricted to known contacts. Perhaps the only real surprise here is that the WhatsApp platform does not implement any explicit rate limits for querying phone numbers (at least it didn't before this research was conducte…",

Well, that was the idea, at least, but the Aphelion blueprint seemingly wasn't dropping for anyone. Thanks to the new 1.3 update patch notes , the drop rate has been increased, and it's officially out in the wild—for real this time. Don't expect it to be easy, though, you'll have to put in the work to get one. Although niche, the legendary weapons are unquestionably some of the best guns in the game, and the Aphelion is no different.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter.

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",

Nvidia's post explains that as ChatGPT competitor Claude is being scaled up using Microsoft Azure—which itself uses Nvidia's hardware—it made sense for the three companies to enter into a more formal relationship.

It's almost more money than my bog-standard grey matter wants to compute. But back to silicon—Nvidia says it will also collaborate with Anthropic at a technical level.

Last week, I went on three raids in a row without firing a shot. It's at this point that solo players looking to zest up their routine might turn to the dark side: picking fights out in the open, setting traps at extraction points, or the least forgivable 2012-ass DayZ behavior of all, shooting randos in the back after establishing a \"Don't shoot!\" truce. Banditry did cross my mind. PvP is pretty fun in Arc Raiders, after all, and after 43 hours I still haven't gotten to do very much of it .
