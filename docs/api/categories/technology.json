So, where does one find a handy source of money for all of this? In the case of Anthropic, it's turned to the military as the pot of bountiful cash, but according to one report, it's now discovering that all that glitters isn't gold. The agreement between Anthropic and the then-named Department of Defense to \"prototype frontier AI capabilities that advance U.S. national security\" was announced last July, and while it was only given a capped $200 million budget—a fraction of the money it's received from Microsoft and Nvidia —the makers of Claude were looking \"look forward to deepening our collaboration across the Department to solve critical mission challenges\".

The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect.

Beyond the possibility of creating fabrics where every fibre is its own miniature system, the scientists say that the tech could also be leveraged into brain-computer interfaces. The study into the fabric-like tech was led by Professor Huisheng Peng at Fudan University. The researchers built circuits onto an elastic substrate, before rolling it into a thin, resilient fibre which can function as a complete microcomputer system. \"FICs can process both digital and analogue signals similar to commercial arithmetic chips and perform neural computing with high recognition accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art in-memory image process…",

However, the new permanent Trophy Display project gives Expired Respirators a new purpose: you'll need them to complete the second stage, Soaring Menaces. Given how useless they typically are, chances are you're stumped as to where you can find them. Below, I'll go over the best place to find Expired Respirators, and it's nice and simple.

Testing Annex is a small area, but it's got plenty of containers to loot, especially in the science lab on the northern side of the building. I recommend checking filing cabinets, desks, medicine stands , and other containers inside Testing Annex. It'll most likely take you a round or two to grab the three Expired Respirators that you need, but there'…",

It's been going from strength to strength, thanks to continual Proton updates, attention garnered from the Legion Go S and the upcoming Steam Machine, and as of today, even official Nvidia GeForce Now support . And now it's getting the active and single-minded focus of a conglomeration of different Linux distributions. It comes in the form of the Open Gaming Collective (OGC) , a group formed, at least in part, of developers for various and somewhat disparate gaming-oriented Linux distros. Developers of these distros, such as those working on Bazzite, Nobara, Asus Linux, PikaOS, and many more, will work together to \"a unified set of gaming-focused components used across the Linux ecosystem\" (via GamingOnLinux ). The various distros represented aren't all built on the same base OS, either; Nobara and Bazzite, for instance, are Fedora-based, while PikaOS is Debian-based, and ChimeraOS is Arch-based.

After spending a week with a pre-release build of Destiny of the Railforged , my enthusiasm is renewed. Though the DLC doesn't touch every aspect of Monster Train 2 (there are no new Alcove events, for example), it's a substantial package that makes an already large experience feel supersized. Also there's a card that lets you grab units—friendly or enemy—with a giant claw and move them to another floor, which feels cool as hell. Yoink .

Protagonist Aava is a renown mountain climber with a formidable reputation and reclusive spirit. We meet her at the foot of Mount Kami: an impossibly lofty summit once home to a society of troglodytes with a preference for living vertically. It's her self-assigned mission to be the first to surmount it. What follows is a 15 hour odyssey, or a potentially endless one, about the excruciatingly careful placement of hands and feet on vertical surfaces. It feels grander in scope than anything I've played in recent memory, and it's among the best videogames I've played in years. The climbing feels unrefined at first, because I've never climbed like this in a game before. Moving one of Aava's limbs is as simple as pressing A, moving it with the analog stic…",

In beta, at least. Before now, you'd have to either access it via the limited browser version, or use third-party apps, such as GeForce Infinity, but a native Linux client will unlock higher resolutions up to 5K, and higher frame rates, too.

Unfortunately Ubuntu is the only officially supported distro for now, although Nvidia does want to bring it to further ones and is \"actively evaluating\" them.

First up is a report that Meta is planning to double its spending on AI this year to $135 billion. Let's just repeat that figure. $135 billion. It's an incredible amount of money. It's frankly incredible that Meta has that kind of money to spend speculatively on something that, currently, isn't proving lucrative for anyone apart from the people selling the picks and axes to help you search for the money. The BBC reports that Meta's CEO said yesterday that he expects \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\" Of course, you could argue that the big change in the way that Meta itself will \"work\" is that this spend represents a massive pivot away from virtual reality and the Metaverse, which was what Zuckerberg used to say would change the way we all work, in favour of AI.

Between June 2020 and December 2025, Cain was in what he called semi-retirement. He was still working on games as a consultant, but as a freelance, remote contractor. After moving to Seattle, he couldn't stay at Obsidian full time as it wasn't prepared to have out-of-state employees. He says that working on different games and with different teams was \"so much fun,\" but \"when you're a contractor you're constantly looking for the next thing.\" I freelanced for two years, and I never managed to escape that overwhelming feeling that I needed to find more work, so I completely understand why he went back to California and Obsidian. \"I'm not in charge of a project, I'm not a director,\" Cain says. \"You can think of it as more of a consultant.

It's not difficult to see why this might be the case. After all, Windows 10 experienced something of a slow death in 2025 , as Microsoft turned off the lights and pushed the majority of users over to Windows 11. Sure, there's the Extended Security Updates program for those that really want (or have) to dig their heels in, but otherwise it's unsurprising that vast numbers of regular PC users have eventually made the switch, reluctantly or otherwise.
