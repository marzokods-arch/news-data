However, the situation is much different this year with an ardent anti-vaccine activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the country's top health official. Since taking the role, Kennedy has worked diligently to dismantle the country's premier vaccination infrastructure, as well as directly hinder access to lifesaving shots. That includes restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines—something he's done by brazenly flouting all standard federal processes while providing no evidence-based reasoning for the changes. How we got here In late May, Kennedy unilaterally decided that all healthy children and pregnant people should no longer have access to the shots .

Chips get gradually faster, cameras get gradually better, but Apple hasn't done a seismic iPhone X-style rethinking of its phones since, well, 2017's iPhone X . The rumor mill thinks that Apple is working on a foldable iPhone—and such a device would certainly benefit from years of investment in the iPad—but if it's coming, it probably won't be this year.

After a brief delay, the European Commission has announced a substantial 2.95 billion euro ($3.45 billion) fine relating to Google's anti-competitive advertising practices. This is not Google's first big fine in the EU, and it probably won't be the last, but it's the first time European leaders could face blowback from the US government for going after Big Tech. The case stems from a complaint made by the European Publishers Council in 2021. The ensuing EU investigation determined that Google illegally preferenced its own ad display services, which made its Google Ad Exchange (AdX) marketplace more important in the European ad space. As a result, the competition says Google was able to charge higher fees for its service, standing in the way of fair competition since at least 2014. A $3.45 billion fine would be a staggering amount for most firms, but Google's earnings have never been higher. In Q2 2025, Google had net earnings of over $28 billion on almost $100 billion in revenue. The European…",

The company released the feature for all logged-in web users following years of user requests for the capability. The feature works by letting users hover over any message in a ChatGPT conversation, click \"More actions,\" and select \"Branch in new chat.\" This creates a new conversation thread that includes all the conversation history up to that specific point, while preserving the original conversation intact. Think of it almost like creating a new copy of a \"document\" to edit while keeping the original version safe—except that \"document\" is an ongoing AI conversation with all its accumulated context. For example, a marketing team brainstorming ad copy can now create separate branches to test a formal tone, a humorous approach, or an entirely different strategy—all stemming from the same initial setup.

Now, though, a developer on Star Wars Outlaws is saying that a technical limitation of the Switch 2's Game Card interface may be driving some publishers away from fully physical game releases on the Switch 2. Writing in a Bluesky thread discussing the performance of the Outlaws' Switch 2 port [which is only available as a download or Game Key Card], Snowdrop Audio Architect Rob Bantin chimed in to discuss why a full physical release wasn't in the cards for the Switch 2. \"Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for,\" Bantin wrote. \"I think if we’d designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we’d build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case, I think our leadership made the right call.\" Read full article Comments",

    "body": "On Wednesday, Microsoft released the complete source code for Microsoft BASIC for 6502 Version 1.1, the 1978 interpreter that powered the Commodore PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and Apple II through custom adaptations. The company posted 6,955 lines of assembly language code to GitHub under an MIT license, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the code that helped launch the personal computer revolution. \"Rick Weiland and I (Bill Gates) wrote the 6502 BASIC,\" Gates commented on the Page Table blog in 2010. \"I put the WAIT command in.\" For millions of people in the late 1970s and early 1980s, variations of Microsoft's BASIC interpreter provided their first experience with programming. Users could type simple commands like \"10 PRINT 'HELLO'\" and \"20 GOTO 10\" to create an endless loop of text on their screens, for example—often their first taste of controlling a computer directly. The interpreter translated these human-readable commands into instructions that the processor could execute, one line at a time. Read full article Comments",
