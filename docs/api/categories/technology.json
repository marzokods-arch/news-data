Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points. Using those measurements, they resized images of the overhead view of each in-game map until they shared a scale of 1 pixel per meter. \"There's always the risk of …",

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

    "body": "For Embark Studios, it was a classic 'good news, bad news' weekend. Arc Raiders hit a new high in concurrent Steam players on Sunday, falling just shy of 355,000 people playing all at the same time. That's very good indeed—what's less good is that 355,000 people playing all at the same time put a little extra strain on the game's servers, and there was, as Embark put it, a wobble . Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues. The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray. It doesn't appear that the game was down completely, nor does it seem the troubles lasted for very long. Up, up, up, whoa whoa whoops! (Image credit: SteamDB) Even so, Embark wants to say sorry for the hassle. \"We are overwhelmed by how many of you joined the fight against the ARC. Your bravery and resilience are truly inspiring,\" the studio…",

Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element.

While it's not quite as involved as What We Left Behind or Eyes in the Sky , both of which require visiting three separate regions, it might very well prove your kryptonite if you hate searching for hidden items. You'll need to collect the First Wave Compass, First Wave Video Tape, and Old Field Rations, all of which you can grab in the environs of the Scrap Yard. All that said, here's how to complete the Broken Monument mission in Arc Raiders. Reach the hallowed grounds by the Scrap Yard This step completed for me when I reached the south end of the Scrap Yard on Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you've got to head to the Scrap Yard location in the south of Dam Battlegrounds, where you'll then have to find three separate items.

YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance.

Every other week, I'll be sharing my thoughts on the genre, interviewing fellow MMO-heads like me, taking a deep-dive into mechanics we've all taken for granted, and, occasionally, bringing in guest writers to talk about their MMO of choice. Alright, let me roll up my sleeves and deliver unto you some lore . Not just any lore: mod lore . Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when. In fact, Blizzard was so dependent on its AddOn community that two things wound up happening. First, it didn't overhaul its user interface until 2022 . Blizzard spent 18 whole years assuming that any player who didn't want to wrestle with…",

I've only ever cosplayed once, really—aside from the odd Halloween costume which I know doesn't really count—but that doesn't mean I don't try to stay as in the loop as possible. I've always been more of a lurker, spending hours scrolling through social media admiring everyone's commitment to their favourite characters, and I am constantly impressed by the creativity the cosplay community showcases. Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. It's been a big weekend for all sorts of cosplayers with MCM ComicCon and EGX in London, and the turnout of people rocking up dressed in their nerdiest best has not disappointed. So, instead of saving all of my favourites to a folder I'll inevitably visit once in a blue moon, trying to convince myself I'll sink more time into cosplay one of these days, I thought I'd share them with you…",
