That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions. It creates greater ownership and greater accountability long-term in a project. Otherwise, you end up with a bunch of idea guys who write all the documents and the rest are there to follow. …",

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game. Even after unscrupulously looting my way across the first few regions, this still put a serious dent in my hoard of bits.

The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.

The technology used to build games today has evolved more than a little bit beyond what was at hand when EA first put the words \"we are an association of electronic artists\" to paper, and the general concept of AI has been…",

Today, that soothsayer is Matt Shumer, an investor who offered a demonstration of his vision for AI's videogame development potential—and was quickly blasted for it, because the vision sucks to look at. Shumer—CEO of HyperWrite, a company offering cutting edge AI tools like \"Team Member Praise Generator\" and \"AI Sympathy Message Generator by HyperWrite for Heartfelt Cards\"— posted a video on X yesterday with the caption \"AI games are going to be amazing.\" Judging from the boastful \"(sound on),\" he seemed convinced the video would illustrate the inevitability of our magnificent AI future. AI games are going to be amazing(sound on) pic.twitter.com/66aOdWJr4Y October 23, 2025 In actuality, what he uploaded was an embarrassingly incoherent AI-generated mockup of imitation shooter gameplay that feels like it could trigger new and exciting forms of psychosis if you watch it long enough.

It's such a bedrock computing experience that last October, when my PC's notification bleeps suddenly sounded like they were being filtered through a dirty fish tank, I made the most natural assumption in the world: Windows had gone and screwed itself up again. Turns out for once (once!!) I was putting the blame in the wrong place. It wasn't Windows' audio output that was messed up—it was just Discord's notifications, which had been sneakily spookified for the Halloween season. I wasn't the only person on the PC Gamer team who was completely thrown by the noise and thought their computer sound done broke. The new notification noise being enabled automatically had more than a few people searching for how to turn it off . Undeterred, Discord has brought Halloween-themed sound effects back for another year and forcibly enabled them for everyone again as a delightful \"surprise.\" But to head off the inevitable confusion and annoyance of holiday events past, this time there's a pop-up to warn everyone about what's happening.
