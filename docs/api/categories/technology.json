Developed by Quantic Dream—known for narrative games like Beyond: Two Souls—the upcoming free-to-play 3v3 action-strategy game has the lanes and towers of the genre titans, but shakes up the formula with a couple of key changes. Join the beta Join the Spellcasters Chronicles beta on Steam Rather than a top-down view, you get an over-the-shoulder perspective that puts you right in the middle of the action. And especially intriguing to card gamers like myself, it's also a deckbuilder in which you can construct and expand a deck of incantations and summons that help shape your strategy. Of course, being a MOBA, the goal is to destroy your opponent's life stone by wresting control over the map lanes and capturing altars to help you build your army. Let's put the cool mechanics aside for a second though, because what totally steals the limelight in the closed beta trailer are the stunningly expressive character designs and art direction. The hero designs wouldn't look amiss alongside Hades' Greek gods or the lege…",

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival now on Steam In an interview aired along with cinematic and dev diary footage during the show, game director Emil Esov and narrative director Antony De Fault spoke about their upcoming game: \"a discomforting and dark story,\" according to Esov. This singleplayer horror spectacle doesn't shun the taboo indulgences of sadism and masochism, but instead embraces them in their most brutal and visceral form. \"Anything less would not be a Hellraiser game\", says Esov. As they speak, scenes of intensely violent melee combat between the player and leather-clad assailants—I imagine emboldened by their immense pain thresholds—flash across the screen. There are meat-hooked bodies, splayed victims, and a plinth holding a heart that seems to beat without a body. \"I don't think anyone saw a Hellraiser game of th…",
