How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed—based on my few minutes using it back then—pretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020–2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on.

These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively.

Oh, and while we're at it, how about ditching the optical sensor? That is the basic proposition offered by the Mirai Create Super EMR Mouse. Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly. EMR devices like this run on the same principles as Wacom's pen and digitiser pads. So, the power for the device actually comes from the pad, which contains an array of resonance circuits made up of a capacitor and an inductor coil. Wh…",

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) The wheelbase itself will be available as a standalone unit starting at $350/€300, and comes with full TrueForce support, which uses game data in combination with audio to approximate some of the details that other direct drive wheels can miss, like engine rumble and precise kerb simula…",

Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

    "body": "Can't be bothered to swap your weapons to deal with different elements in Borderlands 4 ? Then you need to get the Rainbow Vomit . This grossly named legendary shotgun is just as disgusting in the damage department as it is in looks, in large part because it shoots three different elemental pellets at once. Like the Kickballer , you can't farm it right away; you'll have to complete a whole bunch of side missions—or the main campaign—before you can reliably grind this legendary shotgun. Here's what you need to do and who you need to kill to get your hands on the Rainbow Vomit. How to get the Rainbow Vomit in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm the Rainbow Vomit from Leader Willem to the east of Grindstone of the Worthy in Carcadia Burn , next to The Excrucible and the path into Terminus Range. To unlock this boss, you need to complete the following side missions in a chain, starting in Carcadia: Enter the Electi Part 1 Enter the Electi Part 2 The Council Divided A Traitor Within The Mole's Gambit (Image credit: Gearbox) You can start Enter the Electi and this faction questline from Levaine in Carcadia, the faction set…",

    "body": "In an interview with Japanese outlet 4Gamer , AMD has revealed that the upcoming Redstone update for its FSR upscaling platform can run on not just AMD GPUs but graphics cards from other vendors. Yup, that's right, that includes Nvidia GPUs. Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency. We believe that the ML2CODE solution is the bes…",

The ban is said to specifically prevent certain Chinese companies from ordering and testing the RTX Pro 6000D, a product designed specifically for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) handed out the ban to several companies, including TikTok owner ByteDance and Alibaba earlier this week, according to three of the FT's sources. Speaking to reporters in London on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that he expected to discuss the situation with US president Donald Trump during his state visit to the UK this week. \"We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,\" he said. \"I'm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the US, and I'm understanding of that. We are patient about it.\" The ban looks to be the latest move in a long and sometimes-troubled relationship between Nvidia and China in regards to its AI GPU products, and comes mere weeks after the older H20 models were reportedly paused from production as a result of security…",

Deals in the tens of billions of dollars are usually the preserve of those big American tech companies. But US President Donald Trump is currently visiting our little island and already the cash is splashing, as Reuters reports that a $42 billion pact has been made. The 'Tech Prosperity Deal' reached between Trump and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer includes a bunch of things, such as joint AI healthcare model development and work on quantum computing and civil nuclear projects. The pact includes some specific deals by big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. On the latter front, and certainly to the interest and envy of many a PC gamer, Nvidia has said it will deploy 120,000 GPUs across Britain, with up to 60,000 of these being Blackwell chips for Nscale . That AI supercomputer upgrade, in collaboration with OpenAI and Microsoft, will be the biggest in Britain. We've seen Nvidia announce its partnership with Britain and European countries already, but not on this scale. For instance, in June, Nvidia announced its partnership with France, Britain, and Germany to deploy thousand…",
