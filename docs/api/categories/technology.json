Van Buren's the mythic could-have-been that almost-was, a Fallout RPG that would have had everything we loved about the first two games in it and none of the stuff we didn't love about the Fallout 3 we eventually got. Because it never got made it can stay perfect in our imaginations, never having to live up to reality. That doesn't stop modders from wanting to make it real in their own ways, though. There's a mod to recreate Van Buren in Fallout 2's engine called Fallout Yesterday , and a project that's supposedly remaking the whole game as it would have been . However, since a bunch of ideas from Van Buren were eventually re-used in Fallout: New Vegas—like Caesar's Legion, the Big MT, and Joshua Graham—you can see why there would be an advantage in remaking Van Buren as a mod for the game that already has some of the relevant assets.

It now features a mystery-driven narrative, and interactive conversations with a modern English script and a 17th century script (player's choice). \"The feedback we've gotten from our playtesters suggests that players are especially invested in this narrative layer.

Somewhere around \"You've got to be kidding me\" long. At the time of writing, the average rushed completion time for the main story on Howlongtobeat is comfortably over the 60 hours mark. And the honest truth is, I just didn't want to play a game that long that badly. I already have plenty of other, shorter Dragon Quest games to play, and my shelves and Steam library are filled with RPGs famous for being complex, engaging, exciting… basically anything other than ridiculously time consuming.

Another 59% of no-AI respondents said they're not interested in embracing the tech because of privacy concerns—very valid—while 43% simply aren't interested in paying more to have the tech on their devices, most commonly smartphones. Only 15% of respondents said they weren't interested in AI-enabled devices because the technology seems too complicated. That seemingly puts the lie to the idea that consumers are rejecting AI because it hasn't been explained to them clearly enough, presumably slowly and with small words. Instead, it seems that most people on that side of the AI divide are already familiar and comfortable with their devices, and they're not especially comfortable with the idea of tech oligarchs watching and listening to everything they do.

Nioh 3 is an astonishing action game, probably an all timer for me. I've poured nearly 20 hours into Team Ninja's latest—which we just awarded a 90% in our review —and I'm relieved that the relative calm of Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin hasn't influenced the batshit frenetic pace of the Nioh games. Nioh 3 is more frenetic than Nioh 2, which was more frenetic than Nioh. Team Ninja's project feels akin to id Software's approach with Doom Eternal: no finger can be permitted to rest. It's a project in pushing against the limits of player exhaustion. After 20 hours I still don't understand all the systems in Nioh 3, but there's one I'm already super familiar with from past Nioh games: pressing RB to perform a \"ki pulse\" after every attack. This replenishes a bit of \"ki\" (which is basically stamina) and also cleans up all the black murky mess enemies leave around which can severely handicap your damage output. It's kinda like Gears of War's active reload system, except in a game that also has you switching between …",

Most fans agree on a few things, at least, such as the new location teased in the episode and the reveal in the post-credits sequence , which both promise some interesting things to come in Fallout Season 3. And one particular moment from the episode was pretty stirring: when an NCR sniper took the head off a deathclaw to save the day, a slow-motion sequence that pays homage to the opening cinematic of Fallout: New Vegas. Here are both sequences: But that moment has also given rise to discussion about exactly who that anonymous sniper actually is. Some think it's an extremely important character indeed: Courier 6, the actual character we all play in Fallout: New Vegas. It's not a bad theory.

Nesmith is asked at one point about the debate over $100 games, which has been going on for years now but feels especially acute in the year of our lord Grand Theft Auto 6, which some expect to set a new premium price point. The argument is that spiralling budgets and the relatively steady price of games over the years makes such an increase inevitable , and perhaps even essential to the industry's future well-being. \"I remember for 15 years, the price of a newly released game was $59.95,\" says Nesmith. \"For 15 years, it didn't change. Not even a cost of living increase. Not even recognizing inflation. It stayed at that price point.

Starting next week, Overwatch is going to look a lot different—literally, with a new UI, five new heroes, and the kick off of a whole new storyline. Its 21st season—coming February 10—will instead be known as season 1 of The Reign of Talon, a year-long narrative that will be told through in-game events, cinematics, short stories, and comics.

Well, how about a new class of old-school magnetic hard drives optimised for AI and with \"flash-like\" performance that might take the pressure off NAND memory and SSDs? That's exactly what storage specialist WD has announced. In a blog post , WD has detailed a pair of new HDD technologies. \"Two breakthrough technologies can help solve the problem: High bandwidth drive technology (HBDT) enables multiple tracks to be read/written simultaneously, while dual pivot technology adds a second actuator to increase both capacity and performance,\" the blog says. WD claims this results in, \"4x throughput gains without sacrificing economics. Combining HBDT (2-track) and dual pivot can boost throughput from 300 MB/s to 1.2 GB/s—a 4x increase. A future design that scales to 8-track HBDT could deliver flash-like performance at HDD total cost of ownership (TCO).\" A boost from 300 MB/s to 1,200 MB/s is certainly a huge leap. Indeed, WD says that this approach could scale out to yet faster drives. If WD can flog some HDDs to the AI bros, maybe that will leave some SSDs spare for PCs. (Image credi…",

While Koei Tecmo did release a demo for the game, letting you explore the first big region, players who've already gobbled that up will be anticipating the full, unrestricted release of the game so they can pick up where they left off. Compared to previous games, Nioh 3 features an open world, letting you run around fighting roaming bosses, exploring, and ticking off map-based activities. It's quite a big step for the series after the more linear style of the past instalments. So, if you want to try it out for yourself, here's when you can play the game for real, plus info about preloading. Nioh 3 release times for each region The PC release date for Nioh 3 is February 5 in the US, though some of you will be waiting until February 6 .

If that's all a bit bewildering, there is, of course, a catch. It seems that those GPUs are for AI, not gaming. At least, that's the implication. Let's start off with what Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan actually said . In response to the pretty unambiguous query, \"does Intel build GPUs in the future?\", Tan said this: \"Yes. And I just hired the Chief GPU architect. And then so he's very good. I'm very delighted he joined me. And it takes some persuasions. And then I told him that not just CPU, GPU is also very important, different or different application workloads.\" As far as we are aware, it's the first time Tan has made such a clear and unambiguous commitment to making GPUs since he arrived as CEO of Intel in March of 2025. The catch is the context. Tan was speaking at the Second Annual AI Summit, and pretty much all of the interview was about just that: AI, servers, enterprise and so on. In other words, not the PC, not gaming. Tan did…",

If you're an executive that's never played a videogame before, you might think that the largest obstacle between your consumer and a bigger library is difficulty.

What I cannot fathom is why anybody would even think to want this latest patent , ( spotted by VGC ) beyond a brief bout of novelty. Sony's proposed AI-generated future involves \"LLM-based generative podcasts for gamers\". Oh boy. The pitch is this: You boot up your console, which has \"a large language model (LLM) to identify data associated with a video game player's profile\" baked into it.

But wait a minute… wasn't there another war in the works? A different war than the one approaching New Vegas? What's happening with that? Earlier in the season, Maximus seemingly kicked off a war between the various Brotherhood of Steel factions by bashing Paladin Xander Harkness in the head with a super sledge to stop him from slaughtering a bunch of ghoul children. It was the very thing elder cleric Quintus had warned him about, because if Harkness was killed it would touch off a civil war between the powerful Commonwealth BOS (where Harkness was from) and the weaker west coast BOS factions. We've heard nothing about that situation since the fourth episode of Fallout Season 2, and it's not revisited in the season finale……",

It's just this one image, in essence. You can design the entire game as if it was a painting.
