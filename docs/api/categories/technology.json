As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them.

It's likely that you'll stumble upon this minigame before seeing the proper tutorial for it. Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession . Despite the fancy concept of studying your opponent's words and picking the correct comeback cards to win, Gift of the Gab is really a stat-based minigame—which means it's only winnable once you have access to stat boosts, card upgrades, and craftable talismans as part of the Scholar skill tree.

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet. As reported by 4gamer and translated by GamesRadar , Hashino sees the genre as three distinct eras—the past (JRPG 1.0), present (JRPG 2.0), and future (JRPG 3.0). The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like. According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the \"classics\", which is not a small number of enduring pioneers, including Final Fantasy—which continues to release entries to this day after more than 35 years—alongside Atlus' own Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. JRPG 2.0 is the genre as it is now, the modern iteration with \"its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player\"…",

I've praised Arc Raiders a lot since launch, perhaps above all else because it's finally an extraction shooter that's forgiving and welcoming for a wider audience, even as a fan of the genre's traditionally hardcore roots. However, there's a degree to which Arc Raiders' obsession with a fair playing field is its own worst enemy, and it unfortunately strikes deep into its core: the gear system just isn't all that exciting. The confusion I've seen from people wondering what they're supposed to do after they've unlocked everything and completed all the quests should have an easy answer: get better loot, kill things, eventually lose it, and do it all over again. But high-end loot isn't a satisfying and rewarding chase. Firstly, the abundance and strength of free loadouts mean there are a lot of players risking literally nothing in PvP match after match, while those bringing in gear have a high chance of losing it all.

But what's worse than losing all the stuff you came in and found during your run is losing it all because you did something truly stupid. I've been there before, crossing the creek in Dam Battlegrounds ahead of my group, I failed to look both ways before heading towards the Red Lakes Balcony Lift and ended up getting swarmed by a Snitch and a horde of Hornets. Needless to say, I choked and got downed by this gaggle of arcs. My team couldn't get to me in time, and I lost everything, including some items I needed for quests, what a gut punch. (Image credit: Embark) But it'll happen to us all at some point, playing Arc Raiders. Everyone pushes the boat out too far, gets forgetful, or clumsy. There's no shame, but it is infuriating when it happens to you, especially if you've got good loot in your loadout when it happens, which is exactly what happened to player seaskyways. \"I lost 100k worth of stuff in the stupidest way imaginable,\" seaskyways says in a Reddit post . \"I will not top this death anytime soon (hopefully).\" The player also adds a video alongside this post showing exactly how they slipped up.

    "body": "So far we've been thoroughly spoiled in Two Point Museum , treated with an abundance of free updates—from staff memorials to the ever-expanding Digiverse expedition map—and its first major paid DLC Fantasy Finds . Having recently completed Fantasy Finds, I was impressed at the sheer breadth of content and the incorporation of light RPG mechanics that let me live my best Baldur's Gate life in a museum. But, I was a little dubious when the Zooseum DLC was announced—this could be its own game, no? It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

    "body": "The Communication Hideout quest in Arc Raiders has a few tricky steps, one of which involves locating a missing battery cell around the Red Tower, while another involves tracking down a terminal concealed around the outside of the building. On the plus side, though, this quest doesn't require you to extract anything, so you can bring a free loadout . On the whole, it's a pretty straightforward quest all centered in and around Red Tower, so here's how to complete it and overcome those trickier stages, like finding the missing battery cell and the antenna terminal. Find the missing battery cell and power up the generator The battery is located in a box to the northeast of Red Tower (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you'll need to head to the Red Tower location in the south of the Buried City, where you'll then be asked to \"Find the missing battery cell\". This is located in a metal box in the street to the northeast of Red Tower, marked on the map above. You'll find a yellow-marked metal box against the side of a boarded-up kiosk next to a palm tree—this resembles the boxes you've found previous quest items in. Simply interact with it to produce the missing battery cell. Imag…",

It's like the Steam Deck in that way, but it might cost quite a bit more than Valve's celebrated handheld, as Valve coder Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on the Friends Per Second podcast . \"If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,\" Griffais said on the podcast. \"Ideally, we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal, but we're working on refining that as we speak. Right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is gonna be.\" When asked if the Steam Machine would be subsidized like a console, which tend go for around $450-600 USD these days, Griffais said no. That isn't to say the device will necessarily be priced like a prebuilt PC, though. As he continued on the podcast: \"Obviously our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance, and then, you have features that are actually really hard to build if you're making your own gaming PC fr…",

I just had to exist with the knowledge that there was some sort of creature out there that scared my incredibly goth sister so much you couldn't even utter the name. As you can imagine, my child brain ran wild with theories of what it could look like from the vague descriptions she'd given which, in turn, petrified me. Until the day I remembered her terror and finally experienced Pyramid Head for myself. Don't get me wrong, Pyramid Head is a scary horror villain, however it's nowhere near what I was led to believe it would be. Even now, I could name a hundred enemies scarier than Pyramid Head (with the Janitor from Little Nightmares being right at the top. No I will not elaborate.)
