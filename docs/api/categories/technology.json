Now though, as the developer gnaws through the last few items on its to-do list, it has formally revealed when the game will depart early access, and it's happening in March. Announcing the date in a Steam post , Mechanistry also showed off the game's intro cinematic, which it has temporarily redubbed as a \"lore trailer\". I query this title, not only because lore isn't generally foregrounded in this manner, but also because the arc of the trailer is \"some beavers cross a desert and then start building a city,\" which is not exactly deep worldbuilding. It is a nicely animated video, though, with some supremely gravelly narration from British actor Shaun Dooley. As Mechanistry notes in the post, Timberborn has come a long way since its debut into early access in 2021. Previous updates have introduced water pumps , robotic beavers and hazardous polluted water , alongside whole new transportation methods such as ziplines and water tubes.

At one point in development her life would have been at stake if you crossed the expansion's villain Gaunter O'Dimm. The restored scenes use dialogue found in the game files, which suggests this plotline was cut quite late in development, but everything else has been made from scratch.

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

Is there a Stardew Valley 1.7 release date? There's no release date for the Stardew Valley 1.7 update yet.

Well, they require lithium which has to be mined out of the Earth itself, so that won't last for all eternity. Oh, and they can explode, making them a risk when left next to your bed or in an unmanned part of a plane, so that's not ideal. Luckily, a new breakthrough means we may be able to move on from them. Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

In the case of Intel, the Chinese market alone is said to account for 20% of its overall revenue. Reuters' sources say that Intel currently has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for its fourth and fifth-generation Xeon server chips, and that the company is currently rationing deliveries. In a statement to the outlet, Intel said that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demands for \"traditional compute\", and that the company expects \"inventory at [its] lowest level in Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026.\" While AI is driving such heavy demand for all sorts of computing components, chip manufacturers appear to be struggling to keep up.

At least, that's what ransomware is supposed to be. Recently, a new one has been spotted that couldn't be removed even if the hackers wanted to. Nitrogen's ESXi ransomware, as spotted by Coveware (via The Register ), has a \"coding mistake in the ESXi malware [that] causes it to encrypt all the files with the wrong public key, irrevocably corrupting them.\" Effectively, once ransomware gets into your device (often via suspicious links or PC vulnerabilities), it then encrypts your valuable files and stores a randomly generated key that only it knows. That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back. Coveware points out that when the public key is accessed, the ransomware mistakenly overwrites the first four bytes of the key, which means \"no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"…",

For example, I only got three skill points when I reset last time, but instead of $2 million, I now only have to pay $600k for the remaining two. In fact, $2 million would get me those old skill points and two of the second Expedition ones as well. While I think the old system was fine, it definitely makes those bonuses easier to claim for everyone involved, which is a good thing when we're taking the time to complete the project and offer up our loot-filled stashes.

Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows. As of yesterday's Steam (and Steam Deck) client beta update , Valve has put paid to a bug that meant the platform would sometimes forget it can run Windows games on Linux. Cut it some slack; it's 23 years old. The bug in question afflicted users with especially large libraries—though Valve doesn't say how large—and would \"result in Proton games showing up as 'Not valid on current platform'\".

The big tentpole additions are a new raid quickplay option and a major wardrobe update, the latter introducing a fashion template system that, on paper, lets players quickly and easily change their looks. This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates. This one, then, is all about the quality-of-life additions. So how much quality of life have these two new features actually brought?
