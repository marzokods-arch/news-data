Most are usually big, bulky, made with plastic to keep the weight low, and have large stems to hold all the tech. It all adds up to quite an uncomfortable experience and often looks out of place. That is the most significant pain point that Dymesty addresses with its AI Glasses. Dymesty created AI glasses that professionals would genuinely desire to wear daily, with exquisitely crafted frames and sophisticated always-on functionality. Rejecting clunky plastics and poor ergonomics, Dymesty fused premium eyewear design with cutting-edge AI — resulting in an experience as beautiful as it is intelligent.

    "body": "The Pixel 10 Pro sits in quite an awkward spot this year. The main differentiator between the standard Pixel and the Pro model has long been the third camera, but that gap closed with the Pixel 10 also rocking a three-cam setup this time. Getting a solid telephoto camera on a $200 cheaper phone already sabotages the 10 Pro’s position as the real ‘Pro’ for most people. Since Google’s phones are known for cameras — they are called Pixels after all — the Pixel 10 Pro could’ve redeemed itself by offering better hardware. And I don’t mean the sensor or the lens, which are indeed an improvement over the 10. What I’m talking about is the supplementary camera hardware — something the iPhone 16 Pro Max does so much better that I wish the Pixel 10 Pro had stolen.",

Samsung also launched phones with stable One UI 8 in July. The company has confirmed that more Galaxy devices will receive the stable update this month. Meanwhile, other Android manufacturers, such as OPPO, Xiaomi,vivo, and OnePlus, are now expected to announce their Android 16-based updates by October, which is far behind Google and Samsung’s rollout. Google launched Android 16 for Pixel devices in June, while Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, and Flip 7 FE with stable One UI 8 based on Android 16 in July. Other Android OEMs have been running Android 16-based developer betas for some of their flagships, and for a while, it seemed that these OEMs would be quicker than Samsung in releasing the Android 16 stable update to their devices. A new leak suggests that might not be the case, as several OEMs are now said to be preparing for their Android 16-based platform update announcements by October. Leaker Yogesh Brar has shared that announcements for OPPO’s Color OS 16, OnePlus’ Oxygen OS 16, vivo’s Origin OS 6 and Funtouch OS 16, and Xiaomi’s …",

The company has also revealed two new Chromeboxes and the Swift Air 16 lightweight Windows laptop. The Chromebook Plus Spin 514 starts at $699.99. IFA 2025 kicks off this week, and Acer isn’t wasting any time. The PC maker has just announced a variety of new Chrome OS devices and PCs ahead of the annual tech expo. Perhaps the most notable Chrome OS device is the aluminum-clad Chromebook Plus Spin 514, which features the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chipset. This processor is basically the Dimensity 9400 flagship chip for smartphones, but with a slightly downgraded GPU. Otherwise, it still has one heavy-lifting Cortex-X925 CPU core, three Cortex-X4 cores, and four Cortex-A720 cores. In plain English, the Chromebook Plus Spin 514 is one of the most powerful Arm-based Chromebooks on the market.",

It is reported that Samsung will unveil the dual-folding phone in October, with sales set to begin in November. Samsung reportedly plans to initially sell 50,000 units of the phone. The launch of the Samsung two-times folding phone, which is expected to be officially called “TriFold ,” has been on the horizon for quite some time. Back in July, Android Authority exclusively reported on the intended orientation for usage, along with how the dual-hinge phone will fold or unfold. Since then, we have heard numerous rumors about the launch timeline. The most recent one points to a launch at the end of September, when Samsung is also expected to release its Project Moohan XR (extended reality) headset. However, Korean media is now contradicting those reports and suggesting it may not arrive until later in the year. South Korean daily ETNews (Korean) reported on the launch of Galaxy TriFold’s timeline earlier today. According to this report, Samsung might unveil the dual-hinge phone in Korea as early as “next month,” although the actual launch might take place lat…",
