It's real pretty, but Starhelm is also making some exciting promises on the gameplay front: Shadowglass is planned to be an immersive sim drawing on the stealth game GOAT, Thief: The Dark Project. Shadowglass will have open-ended levels inhabited by guards and traps, while mention of daytime heist planning and persistent consequences makes it sound like Shadowglass will have an open-ended, interconnected world⁠.

It started in 2019, and since then it's published a slew of successes. It's rare that I don't have a Hooded Horse game in rotation these days. One of the things that makes its success so surprising—though I'm beginning to think it's one of the core reasons it's done so well—is that Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender started the company with no industry experience, aside from his passion for modding. \"I did a bunch of different things, so I bounced around a lot,\" Bender tells me. \"I don't think I was particularly reliable in terms of career orientation.\" He graduated from college early, went to law school at Stanford, spent a year as a lawyer, then went back to school (to Harvard this time) to do a master's degree in Regional Studies: East Asia.

Part of the problem, very likely, is that the Asus RTX 5080 Prime in question has a very, very similar 2.5-slot, triple-fan design as the equivalent RTX 5060 Ti Prime model. So, at a glance, they look essentially the same—heck, this Asus AMD Radeon 9070 XT Prime looks very similar, too . Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.

    "body": "We reported yesterday that that Nvidia's long-awaited N1X Arm chip for the PC could be just months away , but doubts remain over the readiness of the Windows OS for such processors. Well, wouldn't ya know it, Microsoft has announced that the Xbox app is being released for Windows on Arm. Available from today, in a blog post Microsoft says the app will bring gamers, \"the experience you know and love—ready for you to download, play and enjoy.\" The blog post also called out the fact that Windows on Arm's Prism emulation layer, which allows x86 software including games to run on Arm chips, has been updated to support AVX and AVX2 insturctions. That should broaden support and reduce the number of existing PC games that won't run on Arm PCs. Microsoft claims that, \"today, more than 85% of the Game Pass catalog is compatible with these PCs, and we’re actively working with partners to expand support even further.\" It also says, \"Epic Anti-Cheat (EAC) support also enables fan favorites for games on Arm-based Windows 11 PCs, including popular titles such as Gears of War: Reloaded, Fortnite and more.\" If this is all very promising, there is a catch.

That said, the Secretlab Pokemon Collection has caught my eye, much to my personal hardware budget's dismay. That's right, the Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair is getting a Pokemon makeover, offering three different—and dare I say downright tasteful—designs. You can catch at least one of these premium seats from Secretlab directly right now. Each edition is designed around a heavy hitter critter from the original 151, featuring their Pokedex number and Pokemon type symbol.

Turns out, if you build an entire game around requiring 12 separate WeakAuras (programmable UI elements) and nameplate mods, that's not the best experience for anybody. Even as an experienced player, I spent ages futzing around to get my WeakAuras just-so.
