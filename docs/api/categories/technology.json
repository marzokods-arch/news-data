Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.&nbsp; They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere.&nbsp; Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future. —Caiwei Chen Sodium-ion batteries are one of&nbsp; MIT Technology Review’s &nbsp;10 Breakthrough Technologies this year.&nbsp; Take a look at what else made the list .&nbsp; CES showed me why Chinese tech companies feel so optimistic —Caiwei Chen I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute.

As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required. CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.&nbsp; China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant.
