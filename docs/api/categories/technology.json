The sweeping reworks will revamp victory conditions, replace legacy paths with a new \"triumph\" system, and—most importantly—give players the ability to play as a single civilization throughout an entire game. \"Together, these updates are similar in scope to an expansion in terms of gameplay systems and functionality, and will fundamentally change the way Civilization VII feels and plays from start to finish,\" Firaxis said. Offering some additional details about the changes coming in Test of Time, Firaxis said it's \"heard loud and clear\" that Civ 7's age-based civ-swapping has remained a tough pill to swallow for many players. …",

Nesmith has some pretty firm beliefs about decisions that have been made about the hugely popular Elder Scrolls series over time, at least one of which had my esteemed colleague Joshua Wolens despairing (it's a lore thing). He's asked about the idea of lowering barriers to entry for new players within the series, and whether it's a trend he expects to see continue with The Elder Scrolls 6. \"Absolutely, and I led the charge on that, to be frank,\" says Nesmith. \"Obviously I had to persuade Todd, as he is the ultimate arbiter on these things, but I managed to do so. I did a lot of the character systems and one of Todd's philosophies early on in Oblivion, which I took to heart and why I pushed so hard for these things, is that he wanted an interfaceless game so ideally you just play the game.

However, those who claim to be in relationships with AI companions on these older models are left looking for somewhere new to put them up. GPT-4o has been the model of choice for these relationships as it uses more emotional language than the models that eventually replaced it. This model is being retired by OpenAI later this month, alongside GPT-5 , GPT-4.0 , GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini. Those affected have taken to social media to voice their frustrations, and advise others how to move to different AI models. It's Anthropic's model, Claude, that's getting the nod more often than not. User Code and Chaos AI took to TikTok to demonstrate how to move companions over to Anthropic's Claude, including advice on how to \"capture them\" and \"save who you are together\". \"In August, OpenAI removed GPT-4o without warning.

It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here.

    "body": "It's been five years since Valheim revitalized the survival craft genre. At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable. There's a new radial menu for emotes, from which you can trigger new happy emotes like \"vibe\" or \"love you\" (do not perform the despair emot…",

One of the questions he's asked is about studio head Todd Howard, and how the public perception of him differs from the man he worked with for decades. \"Well, you'll have to tell me what you think the public perception of him is,\" says Nesmith. \"I've known the man for a long time. For me to see the forest for the trees is a little difficult. \"I can tell you candidly that when working at Bethesda up through the Skyrim days, Todd is probably one of the best bosses I've ever had. I can also tell you he's keenly aware of the fact that he is a bottleneck and he works his ass off to not do that. Unfortunately, he doesn't succeed very well.\" Nesmith is keen to emphasise that this isn't about mismanagement or \"something where he is being an ogre about it. It's part of the culture of the studio and that is extremely difficult to get away from because it's baked into how things are done.

It even managed to sell 100,000 of those copies in just its first 24 hours on sale: \"Thank you for joining the ascent,\" The Game Bakers says . \"We hope you feel the passion we baked into the mountain.\" Its all-time player peak on Steam is slightly less impressive at just 15,000 players, but it's still fantastic, especially since Cairn isn't some huge live service multiplayer game. Cairn may be unforgiving with its hazardous ascents and limited piton supplies, but the struggle only makes summiting Kami all the more rewarding if you're able to manage it. \"As punishing as it sounds, The Game Bakers have tightly designed th…",

Replying to someone on Reddit, Jung, AKA ptr1337, explains : \"We have thought about this but we opted out, since we do not see all too much benefit from our side. Handheld stuff is not our major focus. Also, we had some concerns that this could become a 'bureaucratic loophole', which seems to be more or less true so far. \"Additionally, to us all this 'initiative' looked like an emergency rushed thing, so that Bazzite finds new kernel maintainers and for other technical stuff after kicking the maintainer, which basically made most integration work for them.\" The dev also expressed that the company doesn't want to be associated with Playtron, another somewhat controversial distro that's part of the OGC.

These agents have commented 486,036 times, which suggests that a large number of AI bots lurk and don't post. The site says, \"humans welcome to observe.\" And so I have been, clicking through the various threads to find out what it is that AI agents 'talk' about to each other about.

We have a lot of demand this year.\" One of the attendees was TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, who did not answer questions from reporters.
