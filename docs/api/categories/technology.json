The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine. But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.&nbsp; Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls &nbsp; A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions , driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. …",

And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI, and Trump.&nbsp; Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and The Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics, for example there’s one for science and another for AI.&nbsp; But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies.

    "body": "The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure. The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system.&nbsp; Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.&nbsp; At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas.

    "body": "Today marks an inflection point for enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in generative AI, only 5% of integrated pilots deliver measurable business value and nearly one in two companies abandons AI initiatives before reaching production. DOWNLOAD THE ARTICLE The bottleneck is not the models themselves. What’s holding enterprises back is the surrounding infrastructure: Limited data accessibility, rigid integration, and fragile deployment pathways prevent AI initiatives from scaling beyond early LLM and RAG experiments. In response, enterprises are moving toward composable and sovereign AI architectures that lower costs, preserve data ownership, and adapt to the rapid, unpredictable evolution of AI—a shift IDC expects 75% of global businesses to make by 2027. The concept to production reality AI pilots almost always work, and that’s the problem. Proofs of concept (PoCs) are meant to validate feasibility, surface use cases, and build confidence for larger investments. But they thrive in conditions that rarely resemble the realities of production.
