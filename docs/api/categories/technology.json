The telephoto camera is expected to remain largely the same, though the periscope zoom could receive a wider aperture. These rumored changes follow years of criticism regarding Samsung’s minimal hardware evolution in its flagship imaging systems. Samsung’s flagships have undergone minimal hardware evolution over the years, particularly in the camera department. The upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to disappoint with the same camera hardware, and super early leaks for the Galaxy S27 Ultra also painted the same picture. However, a new leak suggests that Samsung might finally stop being so lazy and actually provide us with a camera upgrade in the Galaxy S27 Ultra.

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section. Pricing starts at €699 with one year of service included, followed by a paid subscription for AphyOS features. Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows. It’s a cleaner way of formalising something many privacy-conscious users already do manually by keeping safe apps separate from e…",

RAM kits that sold for reasonable sums just a year ago now routinely cost two to three times as much, and prices continue to rise while some sets are increasingly challenging to obtain entirely. Smartphone owners may feel insulated from these swings, since we don’t buy or install mobile RAM ourselves.

We asked readers to share their thoughts about the new chip, and whether they found it an appealing option. A large fraction of respondents appear to be fans, while others still have a few reservations. Not every car needs to be a Ferrari. Even if you have the means to pick one up on a whim, just being a very fast car doesn’t necessarily make it the ideal vehicle for every occasion — god forbid you need to store anything in the trunk. That same situation applies to smartphones and the chips powering them. Every year, we see companies like Qualcomm introduce their latest silicon, trying to wow us with performance metrics that make the previous generation’s chips look positively glacial in comparison. That’s an important part of progress, absolutely, but just because there’s a new super-high-end option out there doesn’t mean it’s the best chip for the phone you need.",

From jotting down quick ideas in Google Keep to drafting articles in Docs or unwinding on YouTube, I rely on Google’s tools more than I sometimes realise. These apps follow me everywhere, slipping into my day-to-day routine without much thought — until I actually stopped and considered how much I depend on them. That moment came recently when I started thinking about moving away from Google’s services. It wasn’t because I disliked them; I was simply curious whether I could simplify my setup or reduce my reliance on one company. But as someone who reviews multiple smartphones every year — and constantly switches between iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac — it didn’t take long to realise that walking away from Google would make my workflow significantly more chaotic.",

Today, a new report includes some key details about the project, which could be some kind of AI-integrated pen. According to a tweet from industry tipster Smart Pikachu , OpenAI’s forthcoming gadget will “likely” be produced by Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that assembles products like the iPhone and recent Pixel phone models. The tweet goes on to say that the initiative could take the shape of “a pen” and/or “a ‘to-go’ audio device.”",
