The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb!

Crossroads of Ravens opens with our young hero, Geralt not-yet-of-Rivia, about to be punished for the crime of rescuing a peasant father and daughter. Multiple authorities take him to task for daring to play hero, all for entirely self-serving reasons, until an older witcher named Preston Holt steps in to save Geralt and position himself as the boy's new mentor. Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for. Will he have to move into a moldy sharehouse and get a part-time job? Well, no. But he is going to meet a semi-retired senior witcher and be offered a mixture of post-graduate trâ€¦",

That's true of the games, anyway, but apparently it's not the case in the books they're based on. In a new AMA on Reddit , Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski said the whole idea of individual Witcher schools is based on a mistake, and it hasn't gone away because \"videogame people\" won't let it go. \"A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish,\" Sapkowski explained. \"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot.

Sure, I dabbledâ€”but then I'd turn around to see the literal cathedrals folks were building with their blocks and I simply decided to go play something else. We're not all destined to be architects, and I'm more than okay with that. Throw in a bit of redstone, and I'm happy observing others' creativity safely within the confines of my hardware writing lane. One YouTuber called sammyuri has shared an especially extreme Redstone build, building ChatGPT in Minecraft (via Techspot ). Dubbed CraftGPT, this version of the Large Language Model is decidedly compact as far as these things go, featuring only about 5 million parameters (as that's all the creator's \"poor old laptop\" could handle). However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space. Featuring 439 million blocks, this build required the Distant Horizons mod to keep everything on screen and operational. Beyond that, sammyuri claims that this build was made using only vanilla Minecraft's own redstone mechanics. Built over many months, I find that's a creative use of time still preferable to all the hours I spend doomscrâ€¦",

As reported by The Verge , three laptops are launching under the Energizer name, each designed by Avenir Telecom, a French communications company: The Energizer EnergyBook Pro 15, the EnergyBook Pro XL 19, and the Energizer EnergyBook Pro Ultra.

For context on this figure, of all the batteries we've tested lately, the absolute max capacity we've found is 175 Wh on the likes of the Acer Predator Helios 18 AI or Razer Blade 16 . Both of these laptops have RTX 5090s and cost thousands of dollars. Those bigger batteries are an attempt to get normal battery life out of high-end hardware. The Pro Ultra, however, comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. You don't need a huge battery to get decent battery lifeâ€¦",

So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections.

    "body": "Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson says the company's acquisition by a consortium made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners investment firm, and private equity firm Silver Lake represents \"a new era of opportunity,\" and that \"our values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged.\" Wilson shared the sentiment in a memo sent to employees shortly after the deal, valued at $55 billion, was made public. \"This moment is a recognition of your creativity, your innovation, and your passion,\" Wilson said. \"You have built some of the worldâ€™s most iconic IP, created stories that have inspired global communities, and helped shape culture through interactive experiences. Everything we have achievedâ€”and everything that lies aheadâ€”is because of you. \"We are entering a new era of opportunity. This is one of the largest and most significant investments ever made in the entertainment industry. Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment.

    "body": "Every year there's space penciled into the PC games release calendar for an unlikely indie game hit to blow the doors off the Steam charts. This year it was Schedule 1 that had my group chat in a chokehold for several weeks. If you missed out on the drug-dealing crafting sim back in March, you're not out of the game for good. It got a pretty big \"Cartel Update\" back in August and has now hit the Steam Autumn Sale with a juicy 30% discount. Despite the goofy-looking characters, we clocked early on that Schedule 1 isn't just a meme game and that it totally gets around the crafting game malaise by turning crafting into fun minigames . There's your free talking points for any friends who skipped the initial wave on this one who you may be able to twist into getting it on sale. It's me; I'm the friend in the group chat who missed it and is feeling a bit tempted by the discount. You can snag Schedule 1 on Steam for $14/Â£11.72 until the Autumn Sale closes next week on October 6, which isn't bargain bin but is a nice cut out of the $20 it normally goes for. Schedule 1 has actually already had a 30% discount during this year's Summer Sale and in early September, so you can probably count oâ€¦",

    "body": "PC Gamer retro-gaming aficionado Rich Stanton was seriously impressed with Terminator 2D: No Fate when it was revealed earlier this year, saying it \"looks like the best Terminator game since the Genesis.\" And for the record, no, he wasn't kidding . It's bad news for Rich, then, that he's going to have to wait a little longer than expected before he can start playing. Publisher Reef Entertainment announced today that the planned October 31 release date has been bumped to November 26 , for a pretty simple reason: Global financial instability. \"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector's Editions,\" the publisher wrote. \"Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.\" The Terminator 2D: No Fate Collector's Edition is a pretty swanky package, with a Steelbook case and collector's tin, art book, flipbook, a \"premium metal paperweight,\" two cloth posters, a fake arcade token, and more. It's the kind of thing that makes big box collectors think, yes, I would spend $100 on that. Alas, a PC edition of the CE is notâ€¦",
