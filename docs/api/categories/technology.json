Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone. Read full article Comments",

According to reporting by Stat news earlier this week, two immunization program experts—who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the Trump administration—said that because there is no sign-off, states are not yet able to order COVID-19 shots for children who receive vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The federal program provides vaccines to children who are Medicaid-eligible and under- or uninsured, which includes around half of all children in the US. Typically, federal vaccination recommendations come about after a panel of expert advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—publicly reviews vaccine data and votes on recommendations for use. Then, the CDC director decides whether to adopt those recommendations. While directors don't always adopt ACIP's recommendations, they usually do—and often on the sa…",

We've heard the same story for a while, one of diminishing sales as customers tire of a stale product lineup and are repulsed by the politics of the company's CEO. But Q3 2025 tells a different tale. It's been a good three months for the beleaguered automaker, one that appears to have cleared out a lot of old inventory. Tesla built a total of 447,450 electric vehicles between July and September this year. That's actually a 4.8 percent decrease compared to the same three months last year . The Models 3 and Y production lines saw less of a slowdown—Tesla built 435,826 of these EVs, a 1.8 percent decline on last year. But the Models S and X, grouped together with the US-only Cybertruck, saw the greatest cutbacks. Just 11,624 of these collected models were produced, a 55.1 percent decrease compared to Q3 2024.

And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna. Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Argentina's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas.

Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5 , an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2. Read full article Comments",

In the bluntly titled paper \"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,\" the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world. In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 \"can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for\" (that's the \"zero-shot\" part of the title) and that video models \"are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.\" But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers se…",

Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.” \"It was a religion for me,\" del Toro said during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. \"Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints.
