Supports in Battlefield 6 can fully revive teammates with a charged defib hit and can also dish out regular ammo refills, making them the most self-efficient and reliable class to play.

Some noticed the XP purge actually began on October 17, the same day BF Studios announced other XP changes , but now it's official. The change comes after a week of XP farms being the most popular way to bypass Battlefield 6's career grind. Battlefield 6's Portal browser promised a slice of '07 FPS culture : custom rulesets, weird maps, and community servers with a revolving door of regulars. That all went up in smoke on launch day, as XP farm lobbies started cropping up en masse, clogging up all the server space so badly that nobody else could host anything for days. While I'm still occasionally seeing the \"Global Quota Exceeded\" error, a quick tour around the Portal browser this morning revealed a lot more legitimate servers full of players (hardcore playlists, jet practice lobbies, and a chill Conquest servers simply called \"Manny's Server\") and fewer XP farms.

Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way.

Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve.

Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice.

    "body": "Large parts of the internet are still in a state of recovery today, after yesterday's AWS outage took out large portions of our beloved world wide web thanks to what appears to be a relatively simple DNS error . Even Fortnite, Roblox and Reddit dealt with significant disruption , a fate worse than death for many of their users, I'm sure. As the dust begins to settle and services have, in large part, recovered, it's just left to the analysts to determine exactly how much financial damage was accrued. One such candidate is the CEO of internet monitoring firm Catchpoint, Mehdi Daoudi, who spoke to CNN about the fallout from AWS' rather public faceplant. \"The incident highlights the complexity and fragility of the internet, as well as how much every aspect of our work depends on the internet to work,\" said Daoudi. \"The financial impact of this outage will easily reach into the hundreds of billions due to loss in productivity for millions of workers that cannot do their job, plus business operations that are stopped or delayed— from airlines to factories.\" While that figure initially seems excessive, when you take into account the scope of the outage, it's perhaps not too far out of th…",

    "body": "I want to preface this by saying Little Nightmares isn't the type of horror game that has kept me up at night, but on more than one occasion I have let out a yelp and jumped away from my monitor while playing the first two games. The demo of Reanimal however, the newest horror adventure from Little Nightmares developer Tarsier Studios, had quite the opposite effect. The demo wastes no time in immersing you into its world.There's no introduction, no story to follow, you just wake up in a boat in the middle of the sea, engulfed by darkness. From there you're given a prompt on how to sail, but for the most part you just have to figure everything out: where to go, who you are, and who you've just pulled into your boat from the water. There is a significant lack of hand-holding throughout the demo, which is noticeable from the get-go. You're given visual clues to follow, such as red lights floating in the ocean, but aside from that you are left to your own devices. You do have an AI/co-op partner, though. I will say, it is nice having a companion who will occasionally help you out by walking over to a door and calling out to you if you're taking slightly too long to figure things out. …",
