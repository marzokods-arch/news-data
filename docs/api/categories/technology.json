Google has since come out to dispute this claim (via its X account ), attributing \"inaccurate reports\" to \"stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases.\" As spotted by Bleeping Computer , this report was picked up by major outlets , but it seems to have come from a database that compiled \"various credential theft activity occurring across the web\". Effectively, the data appears to be a broader database, rather than the result of a single new attack, and crucially, doesn't represent \"any one person, tool, or platform.\" This all stems from a new update made to Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), a website where you can check if your data has been breached. Last week, HIBP owner Troy Hunt posted to his blog , announcing that they had added 183 million unique email addresses to the site, with over 14 million being addresses that were never before present on the site. HIBP was sent 3.5 terrabytes of data through a new source, which compiles data taken from stealer logs (like phishing scams and malware) and credential stuffing (data breaches where data is easily crackable).

Humans who create things can beat technology just by creating things.\" He continued: \"However, humans probably can't beat business. But we don't really need business. This idea that people need to do business while they're alive is just a result of us all being poisoned by capitalism.

Now no lesser an authority than John Carmack, he of OG Doom fame, reckons the little gold box of AI power has thermal issues limiting its performance. And that has us doubting whether the chip inside the DGX Spark would make for a good laptop APU, more on which in a moment. In a post on X, Carmack says his DGX is topping out at just 100 watts of power draw , far below what he says is the DGX's 240 watts rating. The result is roughly half the performance quoted by Nvidia. DGX Spark appears to be maxing out at only 100 watts power draw, less than half of the rated 240 watts, and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted performance (assuming 1 PF sparse FP4 = 125 TF dense BF16) . It gets quite hot even at this level, and I saw a report… October 27, 2025 Despite that lowly performance, Carmack says the DGX still gets quite hot and he claims to have seen reports of spontaneous rebooting, implying even more serious thermal issues.

    "body": "Humble Bundle continues to come out of left field with some wild deals that intersect with my very specific interests—just last week, you could sweep up $365 of TTRPG sourcebooks . Now, like a true transmutation wizard, the folks over at Humble have turned $203 of comics into $18. The Critical Role comic collection bundle features 21 books, including entries from both the Vox Machina and Mighty Nein Origins series, volumes one and two of the Chronicles of Exandria: Mighty Nein run, and two Tales of Exandria volumes that cover the stories of The Bright Queen and Artagan. In case you have no idea what Critical Role is, it's a livestreamed D&D campaign turned multimedia empire that's currently in its fourth campaign —starting as a crapshoot experiment by Geek & Sundry back in the day, the now-independent company's got its own TTRPG systems, animated series, and (obviously) comic runs. As per usual with these Humble Bundles, there are also some other tiers, with the full bundle costing $18/£13.19. You can find the full bundle details and pricing below: Critical Role Vox Machina: Origins Volumes 1, 2, and 3 Critical Role: The Chronicles of Exandria The Mighty Nein, Volume 1 Critical Ro…",

The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case.
