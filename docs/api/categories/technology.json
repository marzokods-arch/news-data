In charge of the show is Craig Mazin, co-creator of HBO's The Last of Us show, who says he's played \"nearly 1,000 hours\" of Baldur's Gate 3. \"I am a devoted fan of D&D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it,\" says Mazin. Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.

    "body": "The Samurai style in Nioh 3 is much closer to the methodical, more hardy, planted sword master that you'd expect from a soulslike, at least compared to the shadowy ninja. However, Nioh 3's samurai has one defining factor that makes it hard to get to grips with for newcomers: Ki Pulse. Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless. One early item that really helped me is the Running Water skill , which lets you perform a Ki Pulse by dodging. It's as simple as it sounds, but it's another way to get your stamina back after a combo while also evading att…",

It's not so much about finding a rare, one-of-a-kind sword or helmet in a cave, so much as it's about hunting for ever-bigger stats on generic gear. In this way, you're encouraged to routinely swap your equipment for something shiny and new. But what you do with all your old, potentially unused gear is vital. You can sell it at a merchant, scrap it at the blacksmith, or use it as an offering at a shrine to get Amrita—souls, for all you FromSoftware knowers. But it's more complicated than it sounds, and it's easy to shortchange yourself. You might've noticed that the gear you use gains 'familiarity' as you kill enemies—it's the little progress bar at the top of the item description. This is crucial because the items you've got high familiarity with are worth much more Amrita when you use them as an offering at a shrine. You can offer gear to a shrine by selecting 'Preparations' and then 'Make an offering'.

Not only is Jakotsu-baba a real pain by himself, but he's also inside the Crucible—basically a nightmare realm, where any damage you take also decreases your maximum health. What's already a hard fight is now a true test of skill, as every hit you take sets you even further back.

I swear, I spend 30 minutes designing a character and someone completely different wanders out. Since Nioh 3 has a character code system, you can share your character creations with others, or yoink the very pretty ones strangers have spent hours handcrafting—all you need is a code. Below I'll explain how to change appearance and also use and share these character codes in case you want something premade. How to change appearance in Nioh 3 You can change your appearance in the Eternal Rift after you defeat Jakotsu-baba (Image credit: Koei Tecmo) To change your appearance in Nioh 3, you first have to beat the Jakotsu-baba boss in the Hamamatsu Castle Crucible, which will unlock the Eternal Rift hub area. Once unlocked, you should: Fast travel to the Eternal Rift Head upstairs in the building on your left Continue into the room past Saito Fuku Look for the mirror on top of a box with a cushion in front of it I…",

So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point. Yowza, now I understand the hate.

With an included 2.4 GHz wireless receiver and intuitive Bluetooth mode, the G522 Lightspeed can be set up in seconds. It feels comfortable wrapped around the ears. The cushioned pads are spongy and airy, with enough padding, but not so much that you can't hit the frame with your finger with a press. The cups grip just enough to clamp onto the head without adding clamminess in the process. That comfort is enhanced by an adjustable headband sitting just below the plastic shell of the top of the headset. Unfortunately, that band only has two adjustable holes on either side, meaning there are only three adjustment settings total. That does mean if you have a particularly big head , you may find it a little tight. However, for me, I m…",

Put your shades on so you don't damage your eyes when you bear witness to all the unannounced PC games, interviews with passionate developers, and updates on the videogames already at the top of your wishlist. Of course, there will also be banter between our hosts, deep dives that take you behind the scenes of some of our most hotly anticipated games, and more world premieres than you can shake a stick at. Please don't actually shake any sticks at them, though, they're skittish. In the crowded sea of summer showcases, the PC Gaming Show stands out from the pack as the only one made by PC Gamers, for PC gamers. FPS, RPG, RTS, any acronym you can think of, there will probably be a game of that genre in our line-up. And if there isn't, you can send a pigeon to our complaints department. If you're a developer who wants a chance to show off an upcoming game, hit up Editorial Director Jake Tucker (jake.tucker@futurenet.com) and VP of Gaming Melissa Makhmaltchi (melissa.makhmaltchi@futurenet.com).

In an email interview with PC Gamer, Nioh 3 director Masaki Fujita said the threequel incorporates lessons learned from the ARPGs Koei Tecmo has released since Nioh 2. But Nioh 3 wasn't only informed by Team Ninja's own work. According to Fujita, Neowiz's Pinocchio soulslike Lies of P was a source of creative inspiration for Nioh 3's boss and combat design. (Image credit: Koei Tecmo Games) When asked how player reactions to Koei Tecmo's recent soulslike and ARPG releases influenced Nioh 3, Fujita said 2023's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty underscored that, while loot is a key part of Nioh's appeal, \"there's a need to control the complexity of the game.\" Likewise, he noted that some players felt the relationship between Wo Long's protagonist and their counterpart in the Blindfolded Boy was underdeveloped, leading Team Ninja to \"go into more depth\" with how co…",

Though the Superstrike goes one further with haptic feedback, too. I got my hands on the mouse recently and I'm really impressed . However, it's not a cheap thing. It's set to launch on February 10 for $180 / £160 , which is even a little more expensive than the very expensive Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro , the best gaming mouse currently on the market. And given the Superstrike is aimed at competitive gameplay, I do worry that the advantage it gives might be restricted to only the very few who can afford it. Thankfully, though, while visiting its Swiss labs, Logitech helped somewhat quell my concerns on this front. Of course, the price tag for the Supestrike is what it is, but this is bleeding-edge tech, and it will hopefully become cheaper to implement, or be used in cheaper products in time.

The mouse uses what Logitech is calling a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS), ie, a mix of haptic feedback and inductive tech for the LMB and RMB switches.

Reportedly, they can also be used for in-store returns of online purchases that aren't otherwise stocked.
