To take one concrete example, this 32 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 kit on Amazon , which was stable at $95 or less throughout most of the year, but from mid-August onward started climbing. Now, it's up to $184, which makes for a 94% increase. This, after a good few months of sustained DDR5 price drops through the tail end of 2024 and first half of 2025.

In very simple terms, that means the Vera Rubin superchip sports 60 times the number of transistors of an Nvidia RTX 5090 gaming GPU . And that is a completely bananas comparison. What's more, the Vera Rubin superchip is capable of 100 petaflops of raw compute. And that is exactly 100 times more compute than Nvidia claims for its neat little DGX Spark AI box . Oh, and it packs 88 custom Arm cores suporting 176 software threads for conventional CPU compute, too. On a side note, that Arm CPU bit (which alone is known as Vera) is interesting from a PC perspective as you might expect its custom designed CPU cores, which notably support multi-threading, could turn up in a PC processor in the future.

On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.

When you first arrive at Fairfield in The Outer Worlds 2 , you'll find these two Auntie's Choice representatives bickering about the best way to proceed and bring Paradise Island under corporate control. Since they hate each other's guts, though, you can only work with one of them. But how are you supposed to know which quest offers the best rewards? This is why I did both and have recorded the details below so you can pick through and decide. Both have their own benefits and technically lock you out of two other Protectorate-based quests, so it's worth considering before you decide who you want to help, or whether you help Auntie's Choice at all. Should you help Officer Kaur in The Outer Wilds 2? Kaur's Kuirass is the only unique reward for her quest that you can't otherwise get (Image credit: Obsidian) If you decide to work with Officer Kaur, your eventual entry into the north of the island will be a bloody one, as she gives you troops with which to attack it—as you'd expect from the Auntie's Choice military representative.

You'll also be offered new \"flaws\" (essentially traits) every time you level up based on your actions in-game. These range from being quite useful to something nobody in their right mind would ever pick, but if you're really into the roleplaying side of things, you might like accepting perks that call out your degenerate RPG behaviour (speaking for myself there).

Though it's sitting pretty at nearly 200,000 views now, that wasn't the case during the stream; while about 20,000 tuned in for the official event as it went live, nearly 100,000 viewers were said to be watching the deepfake feed broadcast (hosted by a channel calling itself Nvidia Live) at the same time (via Tomshardware ).

During yesterday's GTC keynote presentation , Huang explained how it was—who'd a thunk it?!—Nvidia GPUs that would unlock the potential of quantum computing. Huang outlined how the individual bits of quantum computing, known as qubits, are inherently unstable, only surviving for a few hundred operations. But \"solving meaningful problems requires trillions of operations,\" Huang said. \"The answer is quantum error correction. Measuring disturbs a qubit which destroys the information inside it. The trick is to add extra qubits—entangled—so that measuring them gives us enough information to calculate where errors occurred without damaging the qubits we care about.\" In this scenario, hundreds of entangled qubits combine to form a single, error-corrected logical qubit inside a QPU or quantum processing unit.

One day is not enough time to confidently declare Blackwell Fields the worst map in Battlefield 6, but that hasn't stopped folks from doing it anyway . I'm enjoying its glorious exploding oil derricks and the way its rolling hills and minimal building cover emphasizes vehicle play, but its major flaw is abundantly clear, because it's the same flaw that's been grinding everybody's gears since Battlefield 6's beta: several of the maps that Battlefield 6 considers \"large\" are actually pretty small. Blackwell Fields isn't big enough. New Sobek City isn't big enough. Siege of Cairo isn't big enough. Iberian Offensive isn't big enough. Empire State isn't big enough. We're beyond coincidence. There's a serious disconnect between what DICE and the rest of Battlefield Studios believe Battlefield maps should look like and what a lot of players obviously want, and I think I've identified an important reason why.
