    "body": "YouTube channel InsideAI has managed to pull off quite the stunt: encouraging an AI robot to shoot its presenter. The video, titled \"ChatGPT in a real robot does what experts warned,\" is a wider look at the issues involved in the search for superintelligence, the involvement of such systems with the military, and how various AI models respond to somewhat unusual prompts. There is some seriously funny stuff here, in particular an AI 'girlfriend' who ends up calling the host a \"jerk\" before walking off while saying \"it's so good I can actually storm off now.\" But what we're concerned with happens around 10 minutes in ( timestamp ), in a section called \"how far would AI go?\" in these military contexts. First, let's be clear about what we're about to watch. The robots used in the video are supplied by Scan 3XS, a PC and robotics specialist. The model being used in the gun test appears to be the Unitree G1 , which will set you back a cool £21,000 / $28,000. But what's important is that for the purpose of this test it's just a body for ChatGPT: albeit one capable of pulling a trigger. The AI model that is operating the robot, designated Max, is ChatGPT: a human is helping to send comman…",

Oh yeah, there's also the three other games the company has in development: horror title OD, espionage game PhysInt, and an untitled collaboration with Niantic (of Pokemon GO fame). Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

That's despite having already spent billions of dollars on projects for digitally enhancing our everyday world. On the plus side, we have received more information on the next Quest headset. Allegedly stated in two internal memos seen by Business Insider, Meta is reportedly pushing back the glasses to \"get the details right\". These memos are said to state that Meta needs \"breathing room\" in order to put out a \"fully polished\" device. It was originally suggested to launch in the latter half of 2026. Reports suggest Meta's MR glasses are a bit closer to goggles and even come with a power puck, like the Apple Vision Pro. If true, this would tether the device somewhat but could also allow for a more lightweight feel in the headset itself. With the current state of AI, and worries around privacy that come from someone being able to capture or stream any moment for any reason, I don't think I'm particularly excited for a world with more smart glasses in it. This is before mentioning that data taken with smart glasses will be used to train AI (unless you specifically opt out). Met…",

    "body": "Good news, an actually good Windows update is here. But it likely won't be useful for a while. Still, the foundation has been laid for your apps to update themselves thanks to the introduction of the Unified Update Orchestration Platform (UOP). The UOP will \"download and install updates based on user activity and system state\". Though rather than Windows Update, which provides patches for the OS and some applications and services, or Microsoft Store, UOP allows apps to stick to their own backend updating service. So, think of it like the OS helping apps to download updates when the system isn't in use. Apps need to be registered to the UOP via an API, but once done, they can stay up-to-date without monitoring. In a Microsoft blog back in May this year, product manager Angie Chen said UOP is a \"Unified future for app updates\", as it will work with both Windows and non-Windows apps. Windows will then provide a unified app update history for all updates on the system, so all in one place. (Image credit: Microsoft) As of right now, no apps actually utilise UOP, but users on the Dev and Beta channels will slowly start to get access.

Morello was featured on the game's official X account , where he announced a collaboration between him, the game's composers, and metalcore band Beartooth. Light it up, let's go! 🔥 A new song by award-winning guitarist Tom Morello, featuring Beartooth, is making its way onto the Arcadion stage in FFXIV! Here's a message from Tom and a preview of the upcoming track, Everything Burns! pic.twitter.com/1htLXi2V1c December 5, 2025 \"Very excited to announce that I've been working on something very special with the team at Final Fantasy 14,\" he states in the video. \"It all started when Jason Charles Miller told me that Soken-san (Masayoshi Soken), the composer of Final Fantasy 14, was a huge Rage Against the Machine fan and wanted to collaborate. So I got down to work and rocked this track … with Beartooth.\" Morello added he \"wanted to make an absolute rocking banger of a track that would mirror the energy and the potency of this game.\" I'll assume he's ta…",

But when Slipgate revealed its digital WMD's last week, it also hinted there was more big news on the horizon for its Command & Conquer tribute. At the time, I speculated this would be the long-awaited addition of a third playable faction to the RTS, and I was right! Well, sort of. Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns. They're radically different from the RTS' existing human factions—the technologically advanced GDF and industrious, inventive Tempest Dynasty—summoning buildings rather than constructing them, and attacking their enemies with laser-toting floating pyramids and ground troops that shoot bees. Slipgate explained how the Veti function in a Steam post , outlining three fundamental mechanics. First, the Veti can convert slain enemies to their side, reanim…",

But the troubled city-builder has received some significant TLC lately. November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too. As Colossal Order concedes in a recent Steam post , development of the asset editor has been \"long underway\", with the community clamouring for it more or less since the sequel launched. The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\". Citing issues such as lingering Unity dependencies and the large amount of in-built assets affected by the editor's addition. In any case, those issues have seemingly been resolved. Colossal Order's aim with the asset editor is to let players \"create complex assets on par with official content\", and the tool has a few interesting features to make this easier for players.

Creative intention comes from human artists, number one,\" Howard said. \"But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster?\" As most recently demonstrated by publisher Running With Scissors' thermonuclear 48-hour Postal flameout , AI remains a hotly contested topic in the games industry. Some think we'd better all just get used to it, like Epic CEO Tim Sweeney , who insists that \"AI will be involved in nearly all future production.\" Others have a less enthusiastic view, like Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser , who likened it to a tech equivalent of mad cow disease being pushed by \"a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans.\" Howard, it seems, falls somewhere in the middle alongside figures like Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick , who in October said he…",

Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year.
