In a follow-up post , Sweeney doubled down: \"This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines.\" I'm not sure that's accurate—my perception is that the divide isn't along political lines so much as it is between billionaires (like Sweeney) who tend to view generative AI as a way to crank out more content with less expense , …",

Much like Skyrim's Anniversary Edition upgrade, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition's main attractions are paid mods called Creations. These have been in the game since 2017, but now Fallout 4 is moving away from the \"Creation Club\" branding in favor of the simpler \"Creations\" menu featured in both Skyrim and Starfield.

No lossless for you (at least wirelessly). If you aren't in the market for a budget set of speakers, the Creative Stage Pro has been named the best gaming soundbar , and for good reason.

    "body": "Arc Raiders has taken the gamers by storm, achieving more than 700,000 concurrent players over the weekend, beating Helldivers 2's player record , and just generally proving that extraction shooters can indeed be fun. But all of these successes have unfortunately been mired by Embark Studio's use of generative AI for its voice acting. To this end, Nexon's CEO Junghun Lee recently addressed Nexon's projects (which include Embark's The Finals and Arc Raiders) and his stance on using AI in making videogames in an interview with Game*Spark (via Automaton ): \"First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.\" (Image credit: Embark) The truth about Arc Raiders' use of generative AI has proved hard to pin down , shifting from claims that there's no AI-generated content in the game to defenses of the use of \"machine learning\" as an efficient way to get work done: \"AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,\" Lee …",

Yet Phison's CEO Khein-Seng Pua says that in \"only three months\", NAND prices have doubled (via Digitimes ). What gives? Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, that's the cost of NAND, not the cost of an SSD. Phison buys NAND (flash) chips from suppliers—the three big ones being Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—and then uses them to make their own enterprise SSDs or to make SSDs for other customers. So, if the TLC flash that Phison is buying has risen from about $4.80 for one Tb (128 GB) in July to $10.70, as Pua claims, NAND has doubled in price, but this has yet to ripple into the SSD market. It will, though; that's unavoidable. SSD makers like Phison aren't going to shoulder 2x costs just 'cause. Eventually, SSD prices will have to rise. The primary cause for the rise in NAND prices is almost certainly undersupply caused by high demand for AI servers , which has now knocked on to SSD manufacturers like Phison. The …",

    "body": "From vital crafting materials to random item quests, you need to grab a whole bunch of odds and ends in Arc Raiders . So much that it's often overwhelming and confusing, leading you to lug back a rucksack full of junk, hoping that at least something in it will come in handy. Simply put, I got fed up and decided to get to the root of the issue; I jotted down all 62 unique items I needed to find for quests, Scrappy and workshop upgrades, and the Expedition Project , which adds up to a staggering 1,195 materials you need to haul back to Speranza. Here's hoping my math skills haven't let me down. Nevertheless, in tallying this all up, I noticed a few interesting things. Firstly, you need to loot the drivers of every single Arc robot in the game right now besides a Queen. As you'd imagine, you generally need more of the basic Arcs' parts compared to the tougher ones, though you need six Bastion and Bombardier Cells, six Surveyor Vaults, and eight Leaper Pulse Units. I think it's safe to say we all hate fighting Leapers , and Surveyor drones are so skittish that they're hard to actually put down. So, if you get any of these items before their relevant upgrade task, hang on to them, or y…",

    "body": "A Japanese analytics agency, Patent Result, has published this year's rankings of domestic game and entertainment companies by the 'strength' of patents they hold, via Automaton . Patent Result values a company's quality over quantity and the strength of the ideas being brought to the table, so the ranking is based on both \"the quantity and relevance of their patents\". How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company. The results are based on the year from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, which includes the timeframe of The Pokémon Company's lawsuit against…",

PC Ones announced on X that, \"due to the recent shortage of memory supply, our store has implemented purchase restrictions on some memory products.\" お知らせとお詫び昨今のメモリ供給不足により当店でも一部メモリの購入制限を設けております。・単体での購入をご遠慮いただいているモデル・購入数に上限を設けているモデルがございますのであらかじめご了承ください。 pic.twitter.com/Ri5dbXPPZR November 8, 2025 Clicking through to PC Ones' memory subsection , most desktop PC memory products are listed as being on \"backorder\" and not available. The few that are in stock have a \"purchase quantity limited\" warning, with each customer restricted to a single unit at checkout. So, is this a sign of things to come? Currently, major US retailers, including Newegg and Amazon, appear to have plenty of stock of the best DDR5 PC memory kits , and no doubt some not-so-good, too. The immediate question is whether the Japanese market is a little closer to what you might call the hardware channel. Allow me to explain. AI data…",

The only problem is that everyone else in the game also has access to them, so you have to get ahead of the loot locusts by discovering some more obscure locations full of great resources. One of my favourite spots is in the Raider Outposts in Dam Battlegrounds. There'll usually be great loot in there as is, some blankets or medical supplies, alongside crafting materials and sometimes a gun case just sitting on the ground floor of the Outpost. Then there's a ladder outside leading to the roof, where there'll occasionally be some crates to break into. But the best place in the Raider Outposts to loot is actually in the ceiling.

    "body": "Give PC gamers a shooter, and they will extract the movement tech locked within it. Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator. There's so much sick movement tech in this game! The po…",
