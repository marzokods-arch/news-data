Some noticed the XP purge actually began on October 17, the same day BF Studios announced other XP changes , but now it's official. The change comes after a week of XP farms being the most popular way to bypass Battlefield 6's career grind. Battlefield 6's Portal browser promised a slice of '07 FPS culture : custom rulesets, weird maps, and community servers with a revolving door of regulars. That all went up in smoke on launch day, as XP farm lobbies started cropping up en masse, clogging up all the server space so badly that nobody else could host anything for days. While I'm still occasionally seeing the \"Global Quota Exceeded\" error, a quick tour around the Portal browser this morning revealed a lot more legitimate servers full of players (hardcore playlists, jet practice lobbies, and a chill Conquest servers simply called \"Manny's Server\") and fewer XP farms.

The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC takes what we like about the standard V3 Pro, adds an 8,000 Hz polling rate, as well as TMR thumbsticks, and comes in at the exact same price. If you play on PC, and have the $200 spare to afford it, the V3 Pro 8K PC is a no-brainer. At 220 g, it's a bit lighter than you might expect (being around 60 g less than the Xbox wireless controller) but that doesn't mean it's not sturdy. Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way. If you want to click as quick as possible, flip it the other way.

Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so.

    "body": "Don your RGB hockey mask, tool up, and get ready to dive into peoples' very minds in Den of Wolves , the upcoming sci-fi FPS co-op heist game from Payday 1 and 2 veterans. PC Gamer went to Stockholm to chat to the developers at 10 Chambers and get a behind-the-scenes look at what makes Den of Wolves tick. Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve. Inspired by movies like Inception, The Matrix, District 9, and Elysium, sticking to sci-fi \"gives the opportunity to play around with stuff and think about what is fun,\" says 10 Chambers COO Svante Vinternatt. Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground. It's chock full of megabuildings so that you don't just \"run…",

    "body": "The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is a peculiar beast: long-anticipated, but trepidatiously so. It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice. Thankfully, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X has an easily-accessible M.2 slot, so you can swap it out with a new one of your ch…",

That's according to Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation, who says that over the past few months, the site has seen a \"decrease of roughly 8% as compared to the same months in 2024\" in human pageviews. After updating its bot detection systems, the Foundation \"found that much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.\" \"We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,\" says Miller, \"especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content.\" The AI answers that Google spits up top of the SERPs, in my experience, tend to reference articles from publications—such as yours truly—more so than Wikipedia.

As the dust begins to settle and services have, in large part, recovered, it's just left to the analysts to determine exactly how much financial damage was accrued. One such candidate is the CEO of internet monitoring firm Catchpoint, Mehdi Daoudi, who spoke to CNN about the fallout from AWS' rather public faceplant. \"The incident highlights the complexity and fragility of the internet, as well as how much every aspect of our work depends on the internet to work,\" said Daoudi. \"The financial impact of this outage will easily reach into the hundreds of billions due to loss in productivity for millions of workers that cannot do their job, plus business operations that are stopped or delayed— from airlines to factories.\" While that figure initially seems excessive, when you take into account the scope of the outage, it's perhaps not too far out of th…",

The demo wastes no time in immersing you into its world.There's no introduction, no story to follow, you just wake up in a boat in the middle of the sea, engulfed by darkness. From there you're given a prompt on how to sail, but for the most part you just have to figure everything out: where to go, who you are, and who you've just pulled into your boat from the water. There is a significant lack of hand-holding throughout the demo, which is noticeable from the get-go. You're given visual clues to follow, such as red lights floating in the ocean, but aside from that you are left to your own devices. You do have an AI/co-op partner, though. I will say, it is nice having a companion who will occasionally help you out by walking over to a door and calling out to you if you're taking slightly too long to figure things out. …",

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",
