But Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) is so good-natured that I just can't see him as evil. \"Keep it up and you'll have big gross calloused hands in no time!\" he reassures a little ghoul struggling to remove a bottlecap bare-handed. The rallying cry for his army of children: \"Most kids are dead by this age!\" Thaddeus sure puts a positive spin on things. Not so positive: Lucy has been captured by Caesar's Legion while saving one of its members (who they immediately decapitate, because that's how the Legion do), but on the plus side she gets to meet Macaulay Culkin. (Did you know his legal name is Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin? I'll let you Google why.) OK, she doesn't really meet Macaulay Culkin, she meets Legate Lacerta, played by Macaulay Culkin, and she has the same reaction we all did when we met the Legion in Fallout: New Vega…",

That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat.

But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course. When it's all working as intended, Quality or Balanced upscaling at most resolutions does an incredible job, and I always enable it in every game that supports the most recent versions. Alas, I c…",

Tech has hit a hard graphics plateau: raw generational updates are now nuanced upgrades measured in single-digit frame gains rather than evolutions anyone with eyes can appreciate, and the subsequent pivot to AI-generated frames and experimental hair follicles aren't really revving anyone's engines when those upgrades cost a month's rent. Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby. A bright spot of 2025 was the continued rise of \"friendslop,\" a cringey internet-spawned label for a broad genre of cooperative games designed for groups of friends.

When players finally departed Oninoshima, Chapter 6's map, it was a sloppy soup of disconnected ideas, with First Order bases straddling bug-fighting military outposts and buildings from feudal Japan. I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons.

I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills.
