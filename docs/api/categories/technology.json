I found one of the early weapon upgrades and kind of stuck with that for the next 30 hours. It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this.

Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it.

'Proper' office furniture can easily cost double that of the best gaming chair , and sometimes even more than that. Right here I have my bottom parked on a Humanscale Freedom Headrest task chair, and it's a serious grown up chair. And it's also $2000. I guess, in the sort of office where you've spent at least that much on your pink iMac and the same again on some beautifully engineered 'executive toy', that sort of outlay to support your spine and sooth your buttocks makes sense. But can we justify that as a PC gamer? Honestly, this PC gamer cannot.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws.
