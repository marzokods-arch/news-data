The lawsuit was filed on behalf of children's digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—representing an estimated 14 million consumers in the UK. Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (via the BBC ) disagreed, however, declaring that \"the certification criteria were satisfied and it was appropriate to grant a CPO on an opt-out basis.\" A website dedicated to the action at steamyouow…",

That studio's Warhammer project now lies in the unreleased MMO graveyard, but there is perhaps a silver lining for fans of the genre: Emmert has returned to his old job as CEO of Cryptic Studios, the creator of D&D MMO Neverwinter, Star Trek Online, and Champions Online. On a call with PC Gamer ahead of the announcement, Emmert said that there's no hard feelings between him and NetEase over the Jackalyptic closure—\"strategies change, and I totally get it\"—but that he was \"down in the dumps\" until he got the call asking him to come back to Cryptic as CEO. \"I've been on cloud nine ever since, and it was just meant to be, I think,\" Emmert said about his homecoming. Cryptic, which Emmert co-founded 26 years ago and previously led as CEO from 2011 to 2016, has itself only survived the 2020s by the skin of its teeth. In 2021, Cryptic wound up in the hands of Embracer Group, the holding company notorious for aggressively acquiring dozens of game studios and then doing its best impression of a malfunctioning cartoon contraption with b…",

Bucher explains that he'd been using OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus service as an assistant for a number of tasks, including writing emails, structuring grant applications, revising publications, and analysing student responses to exams (via Futurism ). \"It was fast and flexible, and I found it reliable in a specific sense: it was always available, remembered the context of ongoing conversations and allowed me to retrieve and refine previous drafts,\" says Bucher. \"I was well aware that large language models such as those that power ChatGPT can produce seemingly confident but sometimes incorrect statements, so I never equated its reliability with factual accuracy, but instead relied on the continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.\" However, in August of last year, Bucher temporarily disabled the \"data consent\" option—because, in his own words: \"I wanted to see whether I would…",

A new report says that three of the biggest players in NAND chips, the flash memory that goes into PC SSDs, are all planning on doubling their prices. Digitimes claims that Samsung is planning on more than doubling the price of its NAND chips in the first quarter of this year, \"amid tightening supply and surging demand driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence applications.\" The site further says that, \"SK Hynix has implemented NAND price increases of a similar magnitude, while Sandisk has previously been reported to be planning a 100% NAND price hike in 2026.\" That means three of the biggest players in NAND chips for SSDs all plan to double their prices, or thereabouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025. Samsung's profits for the same period doubled to a little under $14 billion. As they say, nice work if you can get it. Many SSDs are already almost triple the price…",

The new Looting MK3 Safekeeper augment is currently the talk of the town with its 18 item slots, Heavy Shield compatibility, and, crucially, its \"safe pocket that allows any item to be stored.\" Yes, you heard right, any item, which means players using this augment can now safely squirrel away any precious weapons they may have on them. (Image credit: Embark Studios) This is a big change from the usual augment, as until now, you couldn't carry any guns in your safe pockets. The only way you could stop other raiders from getting their grubby little hands on your precious Osprey or Venator was by disassembling them as quickly as possible before you got downed. While this new augment may not be entirely useful in the PvP lobbies, where most players actually give each other great guns instead of taking them away. Some players have pointed out how it will be useful when you're fighting your fellow raider or taking on a Matriarch or a Queen: \"you don't wanna lose your jup/equ/aph in the fal…",

It's not just the fact that, as a generally not small woman, my feet don't touch the ground while sitting in this gaming chair, but also the fact I'm perched atop a 5000 mAh lithium ion battery. Yes, this is a $699 / £580 gaming chair offering an array of features that require a considerable amount of juice. But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg. But even adjusted to my preferred tilt angle and the lowest possible chair height, my feet don't touch the floor, swinging in the air like a tiny tyrant.

The main issue is that A Prime Specimen seems to be bugged right now, though I'll explain that below. The first step of A Prime Specimen is to obtain two Arc Powercells. These are the common Arc material used to craft shield charges, so you'll likely already have a stockpile that you can bring into a raid (that's what I did). Otherwise, you can find them on any Arc machine. So, grab two Arc Powercells and head into Blue Gate to find an Arc Deforester.

Sure, it's not quite as down to luck as With a View , but you'll have to brave Stella Montis' Shredder-infested Cultural Archives instead. In Movie Night's most complicated step, Apollo sends you to the Cultural Archives to find the Stack of Movie Tapes, which you'll then have to extract to deliver to him. You'll also need to find a Portable TV , but I'll go over where to find it all below. Where to find the Stack of Movie Tapes in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) You can find the Stack of Movie Tapes in a pile of furniture in the southwest corner of Cultural Archives , to the right of the entrance via the Atrium. Interact with the pile of furniture to find the Stack of Movie Tapes item, which you'll need to collect. As shown in the video below, if you're entering from the Atrium, just head down the stairs into the Cultural Archives and immediately turn right to find some old furniture covered with a white sheet.

Nvidia previously announced a new Arm processor called Vera and based on custom-designed CPU cores. Now the company has announced an initial customer for the chip and emphasised that it is the first time it has supplied a CPU as a separate product. Bloomberg reports on a new deal between Nvidia and cloud services outfit CoreWeave that forms the basis of what is effectively the launch of the Vera CPU. In what has become a typically circular form for the AI industry of late, Nvidia is investing $2 billion in Coreweave, while the latter will buy up to $6 billion in Nvidia hardware, including those Vera chips. Bloomberg says the Vera CPU will be competing with server chips from Intel and AMD, along with other cloud computing processors such as Amazon's Graviton. But not all that much is known about Nvidia's Vera CPU. Nvidia has previously said that it runs a new custom-designed Arm core called Olympus. Beyond that, data points are limited to the fact that Vera has 88 cores, is rated at 50 W and offers double the p…",

They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",
