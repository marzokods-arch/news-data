In a blog post, the dictionary and reference book company stresses the fact this word was in fact chosen by its \"human editors.\" Merriam-Webster defines 'slop' in the context of 2025 as \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\" Wow, say how you really feel, tomes. The blog post goes on to reflect on how inescapable this tidal wave of brain rotting content has been online, quipping, \"People found it annoying, and people ate it up.\" Naturally, such a blog post wouldn't be complete without a brief etymology lesson. Continuing with the not-so-subtle digs at AI-generated content, Merriam-Webster goes on to explain, \"The original sense of the word, in the 1700s, was 'soft mud.' In the 1800s it came to mean 'food waste' (as in 'pig slop'), and then more generally, 'rubbish or 'a product of little or no value.'\" Alongside Slop's dubious headlining honour, the terms 'gerry mander,' ' touch grass ', 'performative', ' tariff ', 'six seven', and 'conclave' also get a moment to shine…",

In an interview with PC Gamer about the deeper consequences and \"much higher\" level of agency in upcoming RPG Divinity compared to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke didn't hesitate for a moment when asked if they were feeling more or less pressure now. \"It's more. It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.' By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything,\" Vincke said. \"We…",

The little Final Fantasy sicko who's been living in my brain for the last 20 years is hootin' and hollerin' right now. The game first made an appearance during our very own PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct , and last week's Day of the Devs gave us an extended look at one of the songs that'll be in the game, Under the Lights. It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note.

    "body": "Claude-creator Anthropic has found that it's actually easier to 'poison' Large Language Models than previously thought. In a recent blog post , Anthropic explains that as few as \"250 malicious documents can produce a 'backdoor' vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume.\" These findings arose from a joint study between Anthropic, the Alan Turing Institute, and the UK AI Security Institute. It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms. For instance, earlier this year YouTube creator f4mi became so fed up with her work being fed into AI models via her video subtitles, she 'poisoned' this data by inserting gibberish text only the AI could see . The more gibberish in the training data, the more gibbe…",

You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",

Dubbed the Cold Snap, this limited-time event introduces the new Snowfall map condition for Topside locations, turning once lush regions like Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, Buried City and Blue Gate into a frozen hell. \"The update continues the game’s strong momentum with a limited-time winter event,\" a press release explains. \"Dynamic snowfall conditions, new survival mechanics, expanded rewards, a seasonal Raider reset with the Expedition Project Raider, and the introduction of a second Raider Deck included directly in the base game. (Image credit: Embark ) \"Snowstorms sweep across Speranza as winter conditions take hold of multiple raid locations. Snowfall reduces visibility, lakes freeze over, and the open surface becomes more dangerous than ever—turning every raid into a high-stakes survival run.\" Grab your mittens because the Cold Snap release time is tomorrow, December 16, at 1:30 am PT/ 4:30am ET/ 9:30am GMT/ 10:30am CET and will run until the morning of January 13, 2026.

As teased in a short clip, as well as the roadmap, the primary thing to look forward to in this update is the Snowfall map condition, which completely changes the visuals of many regions, blanketing them in snow. This December update is arriving at the same time as North Line did back in November, though there's no new map this time, just the new weather condition, the Flickering Flames event, plus new quests and a Raider Deck. All that said, here's the release date and time for the Arc Raiders Cold Snap update. Arc Raiders Cold Snap release date and time The release date for Arc Raiders' Cold Snap is December 16 , just over a month after the North Line update that gave us Stella Montis and the community event to access it. The Cold Snap's update will arrive at the same time as Stella Montis did.

But I was pleasantly surprised when I found this to not be the case at all. Arc Raiders has managed to find itself in a sweet spot for PvPvE where a shared hatred of arcs and greed for their loot binds strangers together, resulting in some truly brilliant cooperative plays. Something that the devs weren't 100% sure they'd see. (Image credit: Embark) \"Anytime you push a game out into the world and see the community play it, the way that they engage with it is often surprising,\" Robert Sammelin, art director at Embark, told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"I think internally we were hoping that we would strike this balance of having people almost apprehensive on how they're going to interact with other people, that there is this tension, this underpinning of threat, but also the greater exterior threat with the arcs would perhaps invite these sorts of cooperative scenarios. \"But I think internally, play testing with devs, we're way worse people than the community when it comes to how we engage in combat.

Case in point, Framework announced it would be raising the price of its DDR5 memory modules for its laptops by 50% to account for the spiking costs the modular laptop brand is seeing from memory distributors and suppliers. That's not even the wildest part, with Framework going on to clarify that its new pricing \"remains below what is available in the open market \" (link original). Previously, Framework had called out Dell and Apple for 'gouging customers' over their memory price hikes, while remaining upfront that the company itself would have to raise its own prices in the near future. Framework also took the opportunity to assure that existing pre-orders will not be affected by this latest price increase. Furthermore, both the company's pre-built laptops and Framework Desktop that come with memory already installed won't see an uptick in price either—at least for the time being. The company calls the pricing situation \"extremely volatile,\" and states it will likely need to \"make further price updates on both DDR5 modules and on our systems that come with memory, whether DDR5, LPDDR5X, or GDDR.\" The company…",

I thought it had peaked when Jason Charles Miller sang To The Edge in Shadowbringers— the man was on an episode of The Osbournes, y'all . Then Masayoshi Soken took it once step further when he enlisted Sam Carter—lead singer of Architects, one of my favourite metalcore bands—to sing the main theme of the Endwalker expansion. He wasn't done, though, deciding to then bring along Chrissy Costanza of Against the Current fame (also, you know, they did a butt-ton of League of Legends stuff) for Give It All, an all-out banger for the final fight of Arcadion's AAC Light-heavyweight Tier.
