As usual, some of the biggest announcements leaked in the few days (or hours) before the show, but this year had several big announcements that we're actually excited about—not just re-releases of remasters. We got the reveal of Larian's next game, the Star Wars game we have been looking for, and a big new Total War announcement. Here are the biggest announcements you won't want to have missed from The Game Awards 2025: Larian is making a new Divinity game The leaks won out and now we know what Larian's next big RPG is going to be: Divinity. No, it isn't Divinity: Original Sin 3. No it isn't a remake of the first game in the series, which was actually called Divine Divinity. This one is Divinity—just Divinity .

Either way, these fans have been sadly watching the final days of December slowly tick away, one by one, with no sign of a Half-Life 3/X announcement—which means they've pinned pretty much all their hopes on the announcement coming at The Game Awards.

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing. But now with the antiwoke New Republic and its gutting of the relevant regulatory bodies, we're returning to \"massive engine, lightning fast, lives on the line\" speeder races. Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play.

But the best of those reveals is a distant second in the running for The Game Awards' best moment, because in the middle of the show, Werner Herzog appeared to explain Warframe to the crowd. If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer. The gameplay we see in the video reminds me of Bulletstorm—big kicks, exploding heads, lots of shooting—but we also spy some sneaky assassinations, so it isn't entirely about blowing stuff up. The studio is calling No Law a \"first-person open world shooter RPG.\" \"You have experience points and skill trees, and you opt into how you want to play the game,\" said Berg. \"Do you want to be more into lockpicking, or do you want to be a hacker, or do you want to be a specialist with certain types of weapons … We never tell you which route to take, we say that the player can…",

The announcement also finally gives us our first live look at the \"Unified Lara\" character design revealed in early 2024, a blend of the OG and her more modern look, last seen in 2018. This will be the second remake of the original Tomb Raider, following the serviceable but largely unremarkable Tomb Raider: Anniversary .

This is the first such licensing deal between one of the major studios and an AI company, and comes less than a month after Disney CEO Bob Iger told shareholders AI is an \"engagement engine\" and Disney+ is soon gonna be crammed with it . To put the cash to one side for a moment, over 200 Disney characters will now be used in OpenAI's products. This includes Mickey Mouse as well as more recent characters like Moana, and then there's Star Wars (the likes of Luke Skywalker included), Marvel, and the Pixar catalogue. Hey, has anyone here seen Wall-E? There is one very notable caveat to the agreement: Disney specifies it \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\" There are a host of obvious reasons why: primarily the likely objection of said talent, such as Mark Hamill, and the inevitable battle for rights that would ensue. Plus you get into a real grey area with characters like Mickey, who was for decades voiced by Walt Disney himself. I appreciate the following sentence may make some raise a cartoon eyebr…",

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch.

But this same feature that makes Arc Raiders so interesting can also make it infuriating—that's the coin flip.

(Image credit: Embark) \"I’ve been thinking about high-risk ARC boss fights, and how PvP pressure right now really discourages bringing legendary gear,\" Reddit user davmly says. \"Even though I enjoy the PvP aspect of the game, going topside fully geared for PvE usually just ends with my whole kit getting wiped by a third party… You know how it goes. Let me introduce my fan concept augment dedicated to Arc hunting, Tactical Mk.4 (Hunting), designed to let players commit to Arc fights without removing risk.\" Unlike other augments, this Mk.4 would allow just one secure slot \"dedicated for a single Legendary weapon only (Equalizer, Jupiter, or Aphelion).\" It'd also come with a heavy shield, and there'd…",

While the developer said days later that it was \"doing everything in our power to ensure\" it stayed open, the state of the studio and the fate of its shooter production remained unclear throughout the following months. This week, during a panel at Spain's Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 (via Eurogamer ), John Romero confirmed that Romero Games has avoided closure and is continuing work on an overhauled shooter project. You can watch Romero discussing the status of his studio in the video embedded below. \"We survived the cancellation of our huge game,\" Romero said, earning applause from the audience. According to Romero, his studio had \"110 people working on the game every day for years\" when its publisher—presumed to be Microsoft based on previous reporting , but who Romero Games said it \"cannot disclose\" due to confidentiality agreements—pulled its funding.
