The most popular ones simply won't work when Midnight arrives as part of Blizzard's plan to level the playing field for all players. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't gone over well with everyone. Some addon developers have called it quits , while others have expressed concerns over Blizzard's new rules. Professional world first raiders aren't sure what their jobs are going to look like in the next year and more casual players are worried their favorite classes are being over-simplified as a result. In a lengthy post about this new era of addon support, game director Ion Hazzikostas explains why any of this is happening now, what exactly is changing, and how things will move forward as the Midnight beta continues. \"We take none of this lightly,\" he says, adding that Blizzard has \"never designed [encounters] FOR addons,\" but it has \"inevitably had to design AROUND them for the past several expansions.\" Basically the problem was this: When a boss marks five players with ticking bombs, addons can just tell those people where…",

Security Breach quickly became the most popular progression path in Arc Raiders after the community realized those padlocked containers were by far the most reliable source of rare and legendary guns, equipment, and blueprints. If you knew where to find them, a typical Security Breach raider could fill their backpack with purple drops and then extract without ever putting themselves in danger. As of this morning, Embark has stealthily nerfed it. \"We adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items,\" Embark representative Ossen said in a reply on the Arc Raiders Discord server. In a later post, Ossen clarified that the studio didn't mean to sneak the nerf into today's patch, but mistakenly left it out. \"In the notes earlier today, we missed the Security Locker drop rate changes.

This week, as it boasts record-breaking quarterly profits, the Korean publisher has followed that strategic shift by launching a voluntary resignation program for its domestic employees, according to Business Korea reporting (via Automaton ). The program, announced internally, offers substantial buyouts for domestic Krafton employees based on their length of employment at the publisher. Severance packages range from 6 months' salary for employees with one year or less of service to 36 months' salary for employees who've worked at Krafton for over 11 years. The voluntary resignation program follows a November 4 earnings call in which Krafton announced a record quarterly profit of 1.052 trillion won ($717 million).

    "body": "It's been a busy few days for Arc Raiders —players have been crawling for their lives , and Embark announced a new community event to unlock the next map, Stella Montis. But amid all that, we've got a set of patch notes which also look pretty stacked. The 1.20 update doesn't just add Stella Montis into the mix, but it also adds two new arcs, the Matriarch and Shredder, alongside making crafting cheaper, buffing some little arcs, and fixing one of the most annoying issues with PvP fights. (Image credit: Embark) Except for the Wolfpack grenade, which now needs an extra refined explosive, other items like Arc motion cores, circuitry, and launcher ammo are now all cheaper to make, with Spotter Relays and Wolfpacks also being worth more coins now. If you're a fan of the Hullcracker like I am, then this will be music to your ears, as cheaper launcher ammo means more arc explosions. The update also fixed an issue with the Fireball arcs, where they could get stuck on security gates, stopping them from chasing after raiders. Now they'll be able to zoom past the doors right up to your feet and light you up in flames. But the gold medal in this patch notes has to go to the following fix: \"Re…",

I finally finished my Expedition project in Arc Raiders, \"Now I can actually play the game\" as I saw one Reddit-user aptly state. It was a pretty long process, considering I started it immediately at level 20 and now I'm level 33. It saw me desperately rummaging through apartments in Dam Battlegrounds praying for a Humidifier drop, farming Leapers with Wolfpack grenades, and searching high and low for Cooling Fans. The surprise fifth and final stage practically emptied my 256 item vault to fulfil its conditions, dumping crafting mats, weapons, gadgets, and trinkets en masse into my Expedition pod to reach its value capacities. Disregarding the four previous stages, you need a grand total of $830,000 worth of various loot items, and that's a whole heap of stuff . And it doesn't even count towards the loot value at the end of the season that determines how many of the five bonus skill points you get on your next character. For those that …",

The game couldn't escape direct, somewhat unfavorable comparisons to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild—but until Dec. 2, it has one thing over most any Nintendo game. It's free! On the Ubisoft store , anyway. The core game is free to keep, and the Gold Edition—which includes the season pass and some cosmetic goodies—is on sale for $15. The game is also included in Ubisoft's Game Pass-esque subscription on the platform, but it's an odd value proposition when the studio's games so frequently end up on such steep discounts. The promotion is angled to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Ubisoft Connect, as shared in a blog post Monday. I mostly know the app as the cobweb-covered desktop icon I occasionally use to launch Steep or a Rayman game, or as the benign growth I find tacked onto any Ubisoft-published games I try to launch from Steam (a platform Ubisoft has unsuccessfully tried to jump ship from before), but I suppose I can't complain about the cross-play and cross-save.

In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One.

This mission sees you heading to the Departure Building in the Spaceport and scrounging up some old medical records still stored there. The main challenge, honestly, is just finding the Medical Exam Room and where said records are kept. The Departure Building might have a turret, or a pop or two to contend with, and it's also quite close to the centre of the map, where various other Arcs patrol. Thankfully, though, this building doesn't seem to get all that much Raider foot traffic despite its proximity to the Launch Towers. I'd suggest bringing a free loadout since you don't need to exfil any items this time around, but otherwise, here's how to complete Prescriptions of the Past.

If you're out of the loop, Stella Montis is a brand-new map that releases whenever we've pooled enough materials together to complete this stage. While contributing to the community's efforts in unlocking the map is the main goal, of course, it's not selfish to consider the fact that you also earn Merits for donating materials. Merits are an event currency that you'll be able to spend on a new reward track in the next phase of the community event, once the Stella Montis map is actually available. Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu. The crucial part is that the maximum amount of Merits you can earn (during this phase, at least) is 900, so you'll have completed your personal contribution after donating 225 materials. In other words, just 45 clicks, or 46 if you're counting the button to open the event page.

According to Valve, it's simply plug and play. If you have a bunch of games installed on your Steam Deck's card and you plug that into the Steam Machine, voila, all your games are now available there. \"You can take your catalogue from your Steam Deck or from your Steam Machine, and they're fully interoperable, so you can plug it in here and just bring it along with you,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer on the Steam Frame, says.

It was only when I got to try a Steam Deck for the first time that I realised Steam Machines weren't dead at all and now they're back again entirely. So what went wrong the first time, and will the new ones fare any better? To fully understand the significance of the Steam Machine's rebirth, you need to go back to the year 2012.
