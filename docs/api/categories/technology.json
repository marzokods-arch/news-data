And now, it's even going as far as to characterise itself as helping build a \"rebel alliance\" against Big Tech. The company has released an animation- and graphic-heavy roadmap and report , which in many ways reads like a very dramatic vision statement about how it can challenge the way that AI is developing at the hands of Big Tech. It's kind of bonkers, but in a way that I can't help but get on board with. \"What if a rebel alliance of sorts—developers, activists, researchers, founders, investors—joined forces to build something different?\" It envisions that this alliance will \"push AI in a direction that is trustworthy, human-centered and shaped by all of us.\" Which I suppose explains the focus on turning Firefox into an \"AI browser.\" Regarding this, Mozilla does clarify that its vision for Firefox is one of …",

In the case of Anthropic, it's turned to the military as the pot of bountiful cash, but according to one report, it's now discovering that all that glitters isn't gold. The agreement between Anthropic and the then-named Department of Defense to \"prototype frontier AI capabilities that advance U.S. national security\" was announced last July, and while it was only given a capped $200 million budget—a fraction of the money it's received from Microsoft and Nvidia —the makers of Claude were looking \"look forward to deepening our collaboration across the Department to solve critical mission challenges\".

Or, well, that's the gimmick going forward anyway. So far there are two episodes of On This Day… 1776: January 1 and January 10, which actually went live on Time magazine's YouTube channel (where you'll be able to watch the whole lot as they go up, if your only other option is death) on January 29 and January 30.

This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

That percentage was even higher in the United States, where 33% of respondents said they'd been laid off during the same period. 17% of surveyed games industry workers reported having been laid off in just the last 12 months, while half of respondents said their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the last year. The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition. More than 16,000 games industry workers lost their jobs between January 2023 and January 2024. 2025 offered little reassurance that the losses would stabilize as job cuts continued at major companies like Microsoft, which dramatically downsized its gaming division while laying off…",

A limb-by-limb climbing sim that reaches dizzying heights Release date January 30, 2026 Expect to pay TBC Developer The Game Bakers Publisher The Game Bakers Reviewed on RTX 3060 (laptop), Ryzen 5 5600H, 16GB RAM Steam Deck Verified Link Steam Cairn can be loosely categorised with modern on-foot navigation games like Death Stranding and Baby Steps, but once it clicks, it's more fun to play than either of those. Protagonist Aava is a renown mountain climber with a formidable reputation and reclusive spirit. We meet her at the foot of Mount Kami: an impossibly lofty summit once home to a society of troglodytes with a preference for living vertically. It's her self-assigned mission to be the first to surmount it. What follows is a 15 hour odyssey, or a potentially endless one, about the excruciatingly careful placement of hands and feet on vertical surfaces. It feels grander in scope than anything I've played in recent memory, and it's among the best videogames I've played in years. The climbing feels unrefined at first, because I've never climbed like this in a game before. Moving one of Aava's limbs is as simple as pressing A, moving it with the analog stic…",

    "body": "Linux has not traditionally been the home for gaming, but ever since SteamOS and Proton , it's drastically improved as a gaming platform. It still hasn't had quite the breadth of game support as Windows, though, and it's never had native client support for Nvidia GeForce Now (GFN) game streaming—until now, that is, as GFN has officially come to Linux. In beta, at least. Before now, you'd have to either access it via the limited browser version, or use third-party apps, such as GeForce Infinity, but a native Linux client will unlock higher resolutions up to 5K, and higher frame rates, too. I've been trying it out, and it works pretty flawlessly, provided you're on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, have a GPU that supports Vulkan H.264 or H.264 decoding, and are using the correct driver. Unfortunately Ubuntu is the only officially supported distro for now, although Nvidia does want to bring it to further ones and is \"actively evaluating\" them. The company did note that GFN might also currently work on other distros that support Flatpak installation—such as the popular Bazzite distro—but it's only officially recommending Ubuntu for now. To install it, first ensure you have the correct drivers instal…",

Today, we have staggering but somehow unsurprising news of money approaching a total of $200 billion being pumped into AI and involving all the usual suspects: Meta, OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. First up is a report that Meta is planning to double its spending on AI this year to $135 billion. Let's just repeat that figure. $135 billion. It's an incredible amount of money. It's frankly incredible that Meta has that kind of money to spend speculatively on something that, currently, isn't proving lucrative for anyone apart from the people selling the picks and axes to help you search for the money. The BBC reports that Meta's CEO said yesterday that he expects \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\" Of course, you could argue that the big change in the way that Meta itself will \"work\" is that this spend represents a massive pivot away from virtual reality and the Metaverse, which was what Zuckerberg used to say would change the way we all work, in favour of AI. But what of OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon? Well, the story here is that the latter thr…",

In his latest YouTube video, he breaks down how those years went, how he feels about being back in an office compared to working remotely, and shares some insights all freelancers can relate to. Between June 2020 and December 2025, Cain was in what he called semi-retirement. He was still working on games as a consultant, but as a freelance, remote contractor. After moving to Seattle, he couldn't stay at Obsidian full time as it wasn't prepared to have out-of-state employees. He says that working on different games and with different teams was \"so much fun,\" but \"when you're a contractor you're constantly looking for the next thing.\" I freelanced for two years, and I never managed to escape that overwhelming feeling that I needed to find more work, so I completely understand why he went back to California and Obsidian. \"I'm not in charge of a project, I'm not a director,\" Cain says. \"You can think of it as more of a consultant.

The tech titan reported revenues of $81.27 billion , although its shares reportedly fell 4% after the announcement of slowing cloud growth. Swings and roundabouts, ey? But enough about the financials. The news I was most interested in came in MS CEO Satya Nadella's opening remarks , in which he revealed that its current OS has reached a significant milestone: \"One billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year\". It's not difficult to see why this might be the case. After all, Windows 10 experienced something of a slow death in 2025 , as Microsoft turned off the lights and pushed the majority of users over to Windows 11. Sure, there's the Extended Security Updates program for those that really want (or have) to dig their heels in, but otherwise it's unsurprising that vast numbers of regular PC users have eventually made the switch, reluctantly or otherwise. Not that Windows 11 is a particularly bad OS these days, at least in my opinion. It's had some seriously shaky moments , for sure, but as someone who uses it every day, I'd say it's currently in a reasonab…",

One of these temporary changes affected some firearms in Arc Raiders. \"Following yesterday's update, some weapons were affected by a bug that reduced their rate of fire,\" Embark community manager Ossen says on the official Discord . \"This was not an intentional change. We always aim to include all changes in our patch notes.\" (Image credit: Embark Studios) Unfortunately, it seems like this message wasn't able to permeate all corners of the Arc Raiders community.
