As explained on its site , this doesn't mean forcing companies to maintain servers forever—rather, it requires them to have some sort of end-of-life plan in mind, which can take a lot of forms. For instance, giving fan communities the tools they need to run their own local servers. EU initiatives have a lot of stringent requirements before they can get in front of the politicians, including at least 1 million signatures, a minimum number of signatories each from a specific roster of countries, and—more importantly— verified signatures. Essentially, if you don't follow the rules, or aren't from within the EU, then your signature doesn't count. That question mark hung over the whole endeavour.

Hence, all the hullabaloo about Gulp Frog farming in the MoP days . This time, it's Legion's artefact weapons.

CEO and founder of 1X Tech Bernt Bornich announced the launch of pre-orders via X on Tuesday, but the price is far from the only thing giving me pause. Slated for a 2026 release, the Neo is pitched as a humanoid robot that will be able to take care of household chores autonomously. However, it looks like the Gamma could only just about put a glass into a dishwasher, so what strides has the Neo made since? Well, it turns out this robot has much to learn; Engadget reports that the Neo will lean heavily on tele-operation at least to begin with. In other words, you're not just welcoming Neo into your home, but potentially the 1X Tech employee piloting it remotely too.

It sounds simple on paper, but the location of these contraptions is anything but easy to find. Outside of this quest, these contraptions are great sources of loot. You'll want to complete the A Bad Feeling quest as soon as you can, as it unlocks additional missions that you can progress through at the same time, so it's a good roadblock to clear early on. If you're struggling to find an ARC Probe or Courier to complete this quest, then I've got a few tips for you and places to search. Where to find ARC Probes and Couriers in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) ARC Probes look like missiles either lodged in the ground or crash-landed on their sides, while Courers are larger and more boxy. Both Probes and Couriers emit a thick black smoke so you can see them on the horizon. Plus, Probes also beep (it's annoying), so you can tell when you're near one and getting closer. To complete A Bad Feeling, you can find ARC Probes or ARC Couriers, but I generally suggest the latter. Couriers s…",

That's just the circle of life topside, and when that happens, you're back to basics using humble guns like the Rattler and Kettle, which don't hit particularly hard. But what if I told you it doesn't have to be that way? That, for a small price, you could upgrade guns instead of simply relying on pure hope, luck, and a good bit of scavenging for higher rarity alternatives? Well, you can. Only after spending hours with Arc Raiders did I figure out that you can actually upgrade every single weapon you find or craft to a higher tier, finally explaining why guns have a Roman numeral next to their name. That terrible common Rattler I can become a slightly less terrible common Rattler II or even higher if you've got the necessary resources. I'll say, the Rattler, a go-to basic gun because it's cheap as chips, becomes much more usable when it's got a larger magazine, and that's exactly what upgrading this gun will do.

Unlike most extraction shooters, Arc Raiders actually has a full progression system with a skill tree that can soften the blow of a genre often obsessed with loot as the main form of progression—loot that you'll inevitably lose sooner or later. Below, I'll go over all the best perks in the skill trees that you should unlock. Best Arc Raiders skills (Image credit: Embark) There's a total of 45 unique skills in Arc Raiders, most with five upgrade levels, split between three distinct trees: Conditioning, Mobility, and Survival. In general, I'd recommend focusing on any skills that improve stamina efficiency, as it's required for sprinting and evading, and stamina is incredibly limiting early on. As you'd expect, this means you'll want to invest in the Mobility skill tree the most early on , especially as you need to spend points within a tree to unlock perks further in.

Namely, they're fed up with pop-ads for the new Season 1 battle pass, they're unhappy with the new map Blackwell Fields , and they're miffed that the only way to complete weekly challenges is to play battle royale, a mode that doesn't necessarily appeal to the folks who paid $70 for Battlefield 6 three weeks ago. As expected, folks are taking their frustrations out on Battlefield 6's Steam rating , which has now dropped to an overall \"Mixed\" after an influx of over 5,000 negative reviews since yesterday. The flood of negative ratings pile on to an existing trend dating back over a week, around the time players were reacting to the too-blue \"Wicked Grin\" cosmetic , and when DICE axed XP gains from Portal servers in a bid to eliminate XP farms. \"Before season one it was like the moment when Gandalf showed in Helm's Deep there was hope.

On the surface, you face two threats: various Arc robots that'll hunt you down and other raiders who want to steal your stuff.
