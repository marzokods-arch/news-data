It's got something no other retail sim has: pizzazz (it's set in the 90s). Your job is simple: you must turn around the last remaining video rental store and make it profitable in the face of a new challenger, RentNet—a digital streaming service that's well before its time.

However, Panther Lake's official launch at CES has given both Intel and AMD ample room to take potshots at each other. Talking to Tom's Hardware , AMD SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, spoke about Panther Lake. Tikoo said \"Strix Halo or Ryzen AI Max will kill it\" and that \"it's not even a fair fight at that point.\" He added that AMD's top-end chips are \"better than that in terms of graphics performance\" and that those looking for gaming will be buying gaming-specific chips anyway. In terms of performance, Tikoo points out Intel's benchmark results for Panther Lake were compared to lower-end and older Ryzen chips: \"They compared their highest-end to our midpoint.\" Earlier this week, Intel reported that its Core Ultra Series 3 Panther Lake chips are up to 77% faster in regard to gaming performance than Lunar Lake.

There is a bit more nuance to be gleaned beyond that eye-watering figure, though. To begin with, Samsung's full earnings guidance offers the estimated range of \"19.9 trillion to 20.1 trillion Korean won\" for operating profits and \"92 trillion to 94 trillion Korean won\" for sales. Yeah, okay, that is still a lot of won. The guidance goes on to note that only offering ranges doesn't square with Korean disclosure regulations, hence the '20 trillion Korean won' figure.

Question, will that tech appear in a PC monitor any time soon? The answer is yes and no. Yes, the technologies seen in the new panels are headed for PC monitors. But, no, you can't expect to see PC monitors anything like that bright. One useful reference point here is that existing TV OLED panels are already rated at up 4,000 nits, with these new-gen OLEDs bumping that up to 4,500 nits. Existing OLED monitors, meanwhile, get nowhere 4,000 nits, typically topping out at 1,300 nits. So, OLED monitors based on a given equivalent generation of panel technology are much less bright on the desktop than their TV compatriots. We'll come back to the reasons why, but let's just cover off what the two big panel makers announced at CES this year. Samsung's latest QD-OLED panels aren't a radical departure.

Just like the Rotor and Tube blueprints to the northwest and the Stator blueprint in the north, the first few schematics are a short hike from the orbital lander where you'll have established your first base. The Stabilizer blueprint specifically is also near the best Helium location , which you'll soon need for new recipes, so I recommend checking it out while you're in the area. Beware that there are enemies in the area, so you should at least craft the starter Reaper pistol and a few hundred bullets.

It's on the crafting and upgrades side. I hate inventory management and Arc Raiders is particularly bad at it: You're constantly bottlenecked on upgrades by a shortage of some items, while at the same time having an overabundance of other things you may or may not need later. Yes, it's deliberate and by design. But other extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov, despite being on a different level of brutality than Arc Raiders, at least have a player economy where you can fudge through some of the worst by selling and buying. Despite Arc Raiders being quite happy to connect players in-game, there's no means to swap or sell key items in order to get the stuff you really need. I think that, within reason, it's a problem the game should seek to address—and it seems to me that every player would be all-in on it.

It's impressive, especially for a multiplayer game. Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required. I suppose it was only a matter of time, then, until Hollywood tried to capitalise on Arc Raiders' sudden success.

I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card.

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. There sure are a lot of blocks in Minecraft, huh? Some are basic, like dirt, gravel, or wood, but it doesn't take long to start encountering more exotically named blocks like \"Horn Coral,\" \"Pink Terracotta,\" and \"Mossy Cobblestone.\" While perusing the list of 700 or so Minecraft blocks earlier today—this is the sort of thing I do on my lunch break—I thought the names of some of them sounded quite a bit like the fanciful monikers given to luxury paint colors. Tell me a block called \"Cyan Terracotta\" doesn't also sound like a paint color you'd find at Dulux or Farrow & Ball or some other fancy-schmancy paint company. Sounds like a great excuse for a quiz! Below I'll give you some names, and all you've gotta do is tell me if it's the name of a Minecraft block or a luxury paint color . Easy! Or is it? Let us know how you did in the comments. Minecraft block or luxury paint color?",

    "body": "Big tech loves the cyberpunk idea of brain-computer interfaces (or BCI), though I'm personally not super enthused about letting big tech anywhere near my grey matter. EEG-like devices that can scan brain waves are becoming more accessible to consumers though, resulting in a novel control scheme for Elden Ring: Nightreign if not much else. But perhaps there's an untapped market here too, if a recent announcement from HP at CES 2026 is to be believed. We've already covered how sub-brands HyperX and Omen have been smooshed together for a fresh line of gaming laptops , but HP is moving to more literally getting its head in the game. HyperX is now teaming up with start-up Neurable to develop a gaming headset that can also function a bit like an EEG. Why? Apparently in a bid to \" help players improve their focus and accuracy by interpreting brain activity in real time .\" And, before you ask, the thing doing the interpreting will of course be AI. Neurable develops proprietary AI that it claims \"makes it possible to integrate BCIs into everyday products creating a future where technology anticipates and responds to human intention.\" The company is already offering pre-orders for its MW75 …",

    "body": "AMD has teased the launched of a new Ryzen processor with two chiplets, each of which will include a healthy dollop of 3D V-Cache. As reported by ComputerBase , AMD told journalists to \"stay tuned\" regarding the launch of such a chip. If this wasn't convincing enough, Alienware China has announced a new Area-51 gaming PC with the new chip, which it notes as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D2. Furthermore, system builder Systronix has also listed a workstation with the chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 will likely deliver 16 cores, 32 threads and 192 MB of total L3 cache. All of which not only suggests the chip is set to launch, it's happening sometime soon, and it probably should have been included in AMD's CES 2026 announcements. Its absence is a little strange, as AMD had to lean pretty heavily on the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and new Ryzen AI Max chips to (barely) carry the show for gamers. Though this isn't the first time AMD has pulled a product announcement from CES at the last moment; anyone remember the missing RX 9000-series GPUs of last year? Though is the Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 for gamers? You'd think so, considering the abundance of cache on X3D processors as the main driver of their world-class gaming pe…",

At first, I thought it wasn't worth the investment , back before Embark revealed all the details about what we were getting, but once it announced the $5 million for five skill points and the unique skin, I came around to the idea of Presitiging despite a lot of community grumbling . Embark definitely should've announced the details sooner, but at least we all know in advance this season, so it's easier to grind that five mil if you feel inclined. Like many, I didn't have enough cash or time to get all five skill points (I only got three), but I wanted to experience the Expedition first hand. So I packed off my Raider, retired them to a nice farm upstate, and definitely didn't feel bad about effectively sending them to the glue factory for some tasty benefits. Even when I finished the Expedition, I wasn't sure if it was ultimately going to be worth it. The unique skin seemed nice and all ,…",

It's not bad, don't misunderstand me: It's just that if you're a completionist like me, you likely hit Act 3 and roamed around the overworld, ticking off all of your checklists, only to loop back to the final boss and flatten it like an artist with a bottle of turpentine, a paint roller, and a grudge. The game's lead game designer Michel Nohra confesses that they might've gone a little astray, there, per an interview with Edge magazine for Issue 419 (thanks, Gamesradar ): \"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now.\" See, while it's a safe assumption that Clair Obscur lets you keep playing after the credits roll, it's also a safe assumption that you're meant to do a little exploring first—more than that, Nohra explains, most players keep the final boss as a motivating carrot on the end of a stick: \"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content.
