And in a recent interview, CEO Lisa Su tells us that one such choice was betting almost everything on chiplets. The interview took place on Reid Hoffman's YouTube channel , a venture capitalist and co-founder of LinkedIn, amongst many other strings to his bow. The two hosts chatted with AMD's CEO, Dr Lisa Su, about her past and what led her to become a chip engineer, as well as all things AI, of course. For me, the most interesting part was when Su talked about AMD's decision-making process, which ultimately led to the likes of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D being the most sought-after CPU by PC gamers. \"We were in a place where the world in semiconductors, for 30 years, really was driven by Moore's law—the idea that every two years or every 18 months you could double the productivity—and so it was all about scaling, scaling, scaling, scaling.

However, if a purported idea being considered by the Trump administration comes to fruition, they will all need to massively reduce imports and switch to locally-made chips to avoid being hit with a fresh tariff. That's according to a report by the Wall Street Journal , which claims that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has already mooted the idea with various executives within America's semiconductor industry. If we use Nvidia as an example, it currently relies almost exclusively on companies outside of the US for all the chips and other electronic components that are used to manufacture its graphics cards and AI data servers. Its GPUs and CPUs are made by TSMC in Taiwan, with circuit boards and the host of parts that are fitted to them produced in China. Nvidia tends to use Micron for VRAM chips more than any other firm, and while that company is US-based, it also has production facilities in Singapore and China.

But hey, we did get a look at a brand-new battle system that'll be in the game, which plans to stand alongside Virtua Fighter's traditional style as its own thing. Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too. Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware. For gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, a…",

I already wrote about this upon its launch, but the Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless feels like a significant leap forward for mainstream lightweight gaming mice, just like the original Logitech G Pro X Superlight was way back in 2020/2021. That's because it's seriously light and it hasn't been poked full of a million little holes. I remember when I first used the G Pro X Superlight and was impressed by the fact that it weighed only 63 g and was still full-bodied and felt very sturdy. 63 g is old news these days, but flip those digits around and you can impress me once again. That's what the Sabre V2 Pro has done. Some won't get the appeal of an ultralight gaming mouse, and that's fair enough.

Petit Planet release date details and speculation (Image credit: HoYoverse) Does Petit Planet have a release date? No, there's no release date for Petit Planet yet. HoYoverse hasn't even given us a general window yet, so all we can do is speculate and look at some of the developer's historical timelines. Its more recent games, like Honkai: Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero, saw around two years between their first reveal trailers and their release dates.

You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W.

The update has sparked a new round of performance complaints, though, as quite a few players are reporting that instead of being improved, their in-game performance is worse than ever. One of the less-great things about PC gaming is that the nigh-infinite number of potential hardware configurations means that somebody, somewhere, is always going to have problems with a new game launch or update. In this case, though, the problems seem fairly widespread, with reports of diminished frame rates and increased stuttering coming in on Steam , Reddit , and X alike. Some users do say they've seen an improvement in frame rates, or at least that things are more or less the same. But, at least at this point, they seem easily outnumbered by players who say they've encountered the opposite effect. A few players have said clearing the shader cache might help clear up the pro…",

Well, the company's just announced another swish line of wired gaming keyboards featuring not only Hall effect switches, but also a tiny screen. Because why not, I guess? The Vanguard 96 range is giving me some serious deja vu, in part because the foundations of its design are very similar to the K70 series of keebs (and I reviewed the Corsair K70 Pro TKL last March). For instance, these keebs enjoy the same MGX Hyperdrive Hall effect switches that also featured in that earlier K70 range. That offers not just rapid trigger tech, but also adjustable and dual actuation (leaving my other half to wonder why the keyboard I've lent them keeps doubling up their key presses). The 96 in the name refers to the 96% layout, being a wee bit smaller than a full-size keyboard but still finding room somewhere for its rotary dial and 320 x 170 full-colour LCD screen. It is, in a word, 'compact,' though here's hoping that, once I get my mitts on these now available keyboards, I won't feel 'crowded' is more fitting. But hold up, this keeb is sequestering some…",

According to Digitimes (machine translated), Intel is reportedly raising the prices of its elderly Raptor Lake chips by over 10%, and \"industry analysts believe the price increase is likely related to TSMC and the lackluster performance of AI PCs.\" Raptor Lake CPUs, of course, do not have AI-accelerating NPUs. The latest Lunar Lake chips have low power consumption and high efficiency, which makes them strong productivity chips (and good for AI) but pretty weak when it comes to gaming. According to the Digitimes report, \"AI PC sales momentum is weaker than expected\", so those running local AIs are less prevalent than otherwise expected.

It's primarily an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, where the masked killer Michael Myers hunts down four residents, though this time around there will also be a singleplayer component recreating scenes from the film. This seems to be very much the OG Halloween, with no nods to the many sequels in the first trailer (though I could've well missed some), and is I believe the first game based on the film since a curious Atari version from 1983. There's stiff competition in the horror genre, most obviously from Dead By Daylight (which has Halloween DLC), but Halloween really is a hell of a license: it's the quintessential slasher film, and everything from the killer's look to the stabbing synths has become iconic. In multiplayer, this definitely seems to work in the same way as Friday the 13th. One player is cast as Myers, who has various special abilities, is unkillable, and can execute players in horrib…",

First, some more details as announced at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 . Qualcomm has shrunk Snapdragon X2 down to 3 nm thanks to a newer production process from TSMC. That's essentially the enabler for everything else that follows. The 18 cores are all a new third-gen Oryon design that Qualcomm claims was started from a \"blank slate.\" The result is 39% improved per-core performance and 50% faster peak multi-threaded CPU performance. To that you can add 2.3x peak GPU performance and 78% more NPU performance. What's more, Qualcomm claims to have created the first 5 GHz Arm chip. Oh, and the top chip now has a 192-bit memory bus and supports 4K 144 Hz displays. This is serious stuff. In fact, Qualcomm has introduced a whole new tier of Snapdragon for the top model.
