The game that seems to worry Activision, though? Going by the chat function in Black Ops 7, it's Arc Raiders (due out on October 30). The words \"Arc Raiders\" are censored in Black Ops 7 chat. PCG's Elie Gould tested it out, and when you try to type those words you just get a load of asterisks. Neither \"Arc\" nor \"Raiders\" is picked up like this, only the two words together. Now, there is one kink worth considering here before we all get the pitchforks out. Several months ago users reported a similar problem in the EA App chat . First of all it's surprising that anyone used chat in the EA App, but the situation here was exactly the same. Once this was noticed EA seemed to move quickly to correct the situation, and players could happily chat about Arc Raiders on the EA App from 6 August. EA obviously has Battlefield 6 launching this Friday, so in both cases these companies have dir…",

So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

Created in actual GZDoom, the open-source Doom engine first forked all the way back in 2005, Mala Petaka is a for-real modern Doom clone that swaps out the hell and heavy metal for a lot of primary colours and some banging chiptunes. I've spent a bit of time mucking about in its demo and, my friends, it works. (Image credit: Hellforge Studios) It's also hard , or maybe I'm just bad at it. Your skull-faced protagonist, Petaka, goes from blemish-free to bloody in record time, and enemies approach you in swarms and hails of gunfire. I died. A lot. To deal with this challenge, Mala Petaka incorporates a few modern-shooter gubbins into its GZDoom framework. Most notable is a pseudo-glory-kill mechanic: whittle enemies down enough and you can eventually deliver a quick rat-a-tat of punches that turn them into a fountain of ammo and health chips.

The crossover update launched on September 29, 2025, and since then there have been just over 5,000 reviews posted, with just under 80% of those negative. The Steam reviews make for some grim reading , and what's especially notable is how many of them begin by talking about the reviewer's love for the Monster Hunter series, with the obvious comparison point of MH: World frequently used. The game's overall reviews are just about treading water at \"Mixed\" but those 5,000 \"mostly negative\" recent reviews are taking a toll. . \"The game is fun but completely overshadowed by the technical issues, which have been here since day one,\" says Sol FamilyGuy.

Exactly how many GPUs AMD will sell to OpenAI isn't clear, but the announcement says that if the arrangement comes fully to fruition, OpenAI will be running fully 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Intriguingly, the deal also includes OpenAI taking an up to 10% equity stake in AMD. The first 1 gigawatt tranche kicks off in the second half of next year based on AMD's next-gen Instinct MI450 AI GPU. At the same time, OpenAI will acquire the first segment of up to 160 million AMD shares. If the deal progresses right through to the final 6 gigawatt GPU power figure, OpenAI will by then have bought 160 million AMD shares accounting for roughly 10% of the company. At current values, that would be a $26 billion investment. So, it's a megabucks deal all round. It also the first really big AI GPU win of this kind for AMD, at least that we are aware of. It looks like it's big news too for the markets, as AMD's share price rocketed up 35% on the news during early trading . Kerching! It's yet another good news item for AMD in stark contrast to Intel's ongoing trials and tribulations . It's also the first time that AMD…",

In a blog posted to the site today, Activision boasted some pretty impressive numbers, at least at first glance. \"Cheaters were expected. But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems, helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn’t last long.

Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\". It also shuts out people without TPM on their processors (hence the aforementioned Linux upset). The \"automated systems\" are referring to Ricochet, an anti-cheat system that uses AI—if these nu…",

    "body": "Painfully high graphics card pricing has become a seemingly permanent norm and at least some of that comes down to the impact of the burgeoning AI boom. Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",

Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour.

It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm.
