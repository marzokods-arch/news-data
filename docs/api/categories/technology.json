Key visual changes include “Extra Dark Mode,” minimalist icons, a simplified status bar design, and new lock screen clocks. New features include AI-generated widgets, expanded Glyph support for third-party apps, and dual-window multitasking. Android 16 publicly debuted in June, but users beyond Pixels and select Samsung Galaxy phones had to wait a while before the stable update landed on their phones. Nothing rolled out Nothing OS 4.0 open beta in October and promised that the stable update would land in November . True to its promise (down to the date, impressively), Nothing is now rolling out Android 16-based Nothing OS 4.0 to its phones, starting with the Nothing Phone 3.

If there was one feature I was truly manifesting for my Pixel 10 Pro (or any Android phone for that matter), it was proper AirDrop support between iPhones, Android devices, Macs, and iPads . As someone who works for an Android website yet also nibbles on the forbidden fruit, I have shed actual tears trying to move files between my Android phone, MacBook, and iPhone. I’m WhatsApping images to myself like it’s 2015, emailing documents like it’s 2007, digging out cables like I’m on a treasure hunt, all for something as basic as transferring files. If it were up to Apple, I and many others like me might never have seen this day. But thanks to Google going delightfully rogue and doing one of the coolest things for Android this year, my hacky file-transfer misery might finally be behind me… at least until Apple decides this tiny moment of cross-platform joy has gone on long enough.",

From modifying our existing stock images to seamlessly add new text, to generating eye-catching thumbnails for our Authority Insights Podcast , Nano Banana has been an immensely useful tool for my work.

While designed to prevent interference with aircraft communications, many people also use the feature on the ground to preserve battery life. Although enabling Airplane Mode is simple, Android phones and Wear OS watches don’t currently sync this state. You must remember to toggle it on both devices individually.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos may soon introduce a popular iOS feature, which converts photos into stickers. Google has already introduced this functionality on iOS, and the Android version is expected to follow suit. We were able to tweak our way into enabling it, bringing you a preview of how it might function. When Apple released iOS 17 about two years ago, it added a feature that instantly garnered a lot of attention. The feature allowed iPhone users to tap and hold on any image to select the subject and convert it into a sticker that can be used across different messaging apps or used as a separate background-free image. It became an instant hit, which prompted Android manufacturers, including Samsung , Xiaomi, and OnePlus, to follow suit and bring it to their respective photo gallery apps. Besides these brands, Google also implemented a similar functionality in Photos to make it more widely accessible, but limited it to iOS users at the time of its launch earlier this year. On the sidelines, however, it has been testing the functionality for Android users and is now making progress toward making it a reality.",
