I always thought Gwent was too much of a commitment for a minigame contained within a 300-hour RPG, and preferred the simpler, more intuitive fun of rolling high-scoring poker hands with fistfuls of dice seen in the first two games. While it's unlikely we'll ever see Dice Poker get an official spinoff in the way Gwent did , it does finally have its own dedicated roguelike. Dead Finger Dice is an Inscryption -ish mix of digital tabletop gaming and spooky narrative puzzling, with a gnarly twist where you use your character's fingers as betting currency. The premise is that you've been kidnapped and imprisoned aboard The Avarice, a luxury yacht inhabited by bloodthirsty demonic billionaires. These sadistic superrich monsters, who include Nosferatu-ish vampires and snake-headed Medusas among their ranks, force you to play games of Dice Poker, where you get five dice and four rolls to achieve the highest-scoring poker-hand you can.

There was certainly potential in running around playing janitor within the brutalist interdimensional nexus known as The Oldest House. But Remedy's cooperative shooter simply didn't feel ready for action, as I discovered in my FBC: Firebreak review . It was too lean, too repetitive, too unbalanced, and lacked some fundamental features like a proper tutorial. Remedy has spent the last few months plugging holes in Firebreak's leaky hull, but the latest patch, which arrives next week, represents the studio's first proper attempt to turn the ship around. The dramatically named Breakpoint update seems, on paper, to represent a complete overhaul of Firebreak's core experience, while also adding a whole new mission and a bunch of smaller features, too. At the heart of Breakpoint is a total rework of how missions are selected. The Jobs board—from which players picked a mission to play and then customised its difficulty and length—has been hacked to splinters with a fire axe and tossed into a skip. It's replaced by a 'Crises' board that offers a tailored selection of Jobs with preset lengths that refresh every 30 m…",

Ananta is borrowing—or brazenly copying—a lot , but it might have some wild-ass ideas of its own, too. The main impression I got from playing about half-an-hour of Ananta at this year's Tokyo Game Show was: Wow it must have taken a lot of people to make this game! China is on the path to dominate the next decade of triple-A games , and there's no flashier way to do it than to make (or at least appear to be making) the ur-game. Every mechanic from the top 10 or 20 or 50 most popular games in the world, combined, is surely better than any of those games individually, right? This maximalist approach to big budget game design has never really been great in practice, and a few minutes into Ananta reveal it is indeed doing things that you have done many times in a game before and probably are not foam…",

Plenty of players have already been to The Slab , a prison area you get taken to after being captured by a specific enemy early in the game. It's a scary place that strips you of your gear and forces you to fight your way out with your bare hands and basic movement abilities. Parts of Silksong can be cruel, but Team Cherry at least designed it so you can't be imprisoned unless you've progressed far enough into the game to have the tools you need to escape. Or so we thought.

In a blog post published yesterday, Blizzard revealed a series of new cosmetics that bring a Starcraft-themed armor set for each Diablo 4 class. And I won't blame you for cocking an eyebrow: It's not the first time Sanctuary's seen crossover cosmetics from another Blizzard IP—D4's gotten multiple rounds of Warcraft skins—but Azeroth's spiky fantasy armor feels like an easier fit for Diablo's gothic palette than Starcraft's scifi soldiers and aliens.

And in a recent interview, CEO Lisa Su tells us that one such choice was betting almost everything on chiplets. The interview took place on Reid Hoffman's YouTube channel , a venture capitalist and co-founder of LinkedIn, amongst many other strings to his bow. The two hosts chatted with AMD's CEO, Dr Lisa Su, about her past and what led her to become a chip engineer, as well as all things AI, of course. For me, the most interesting part was when Su talked about AMD's decision-making process, which ultimately led to the likes of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D being the most sought-after CPU by PC gamers. \"We were in a place where the world in semiconductors, for 30 years, really was driven by Moore's law—the idea that every two years or every 18 months you could double the productivity—and so it was all about scaling, scaling, scaling, scaling.

Called Uprising, it seems like RGG Studio's attempt at delving into a more modern fighting game formula with \"dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities,\" according to the presentation. These opportunities come in the form of new mechanics Flowguard, Break and Rush, and the Stunner and Stun Combo systems. The first is a \"new defensive system designed with stylish movements,\" which RGG Studio says \"expands options and introduces fresh dynamics for offense and defense beyond traditional guarding.\" Flowguard's defensive options are closely tied to Break and Rush, which seems to be the main selling point behind Uprising. It's essentially a part break system—repeatedly damaging the same body parts—like the head, body, and legs—will eventually open up huge vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to gain access to \"powerful offensive o…",

Microsoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month . The rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format.

    "body": "It's announcement after announcement with HoYoverse lately, and just on the heels of its Honkai: Nexus Anima reveal, the publisher has introduced Petit Planet. It's a painfully cute, Animal Crossing-inspired life sim that takes yet another HoYo game setting to the stars. I'm beginning to sense a theme here. From the looks of it, Petit Planet gives us all a little corner of the galaxy to decorate and nourish. Over time, new neighbors show up and shape the world with you. Their friendship impacts how your planet grows, and you'll do all of the day-to-day basics like gardening, crafting, and decorating while seeing your little cosmic community thrive. Petit Planet release date details and speculation (Image credit: HoYoverse) Does Petit Planet have a release date? No, there's no release date for Petit Planet yet. HoYoverse hasn't even given us a general window yet, so all we can do is speculate and look at some of the developer's historical timelines. Its more recent games, like Honkai: Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero, saw around two years between their first reveal trailers and their release dates. None of this is to say we've got a long wait for Petit Planet, but we've at least got…",

    "body": "Xbox's latest device isn't a new console: instead, it's a set of familiar-looking handheld gaming PCs, and very expensive ones at that. After months of teases, rumours, and speculation, we finally have the official pricing details. You will be able to preorder both the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X as of today, with the standard Ally fetching $600 and the Xbox Ally X costing $1,000. The cheaper of the two devices, the white $600 ROG Xbox Ally comes with a Ryzen Z2 A processor, which offers eight RDNA 2 cores and a boost frequency of up to 1800 MHz. This is almost the same as the Steam Deck , which comes in at half the price, and benefits from the lightweight, Linux-based SteamOS. Not a good start for Microsoft. Up next is the black ROG Xbox Ally X, which has the new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in it and comes in at $1,000. This chip was recently benchmarked against the Z1 Extreme , which you will find in the still rather great original ROG Ally X. Despite the upgrade to three Zen 5 and five Zen 5c cores (as opposed to eight Zen 4), the Z2 Extreme only sees a performance uplift of 12% in Cyberpunk 2077 with both machines at 25 W. Dropping down to 17 W, that same test saw a 22% difference. Eff…",
