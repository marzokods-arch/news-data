But while a metalhead from the Midwest or Northern Norway might load a bunch a friends into a beat-up van and road trip to the nearest big city, that wasn’t really an option for Lockman. Until recently, there wasn’t a modern music venue in his home country of Bahrain, period. Many years later, Metallica played the Kingdom of Bahrain for the first time ever, rocking 10,000 adrenalized fans at the Beyon Al Dana Amphitheatre on Wednesday, Dec. 3, on their M72 World Tour. Lockman, naturally, was front and center at the sold-out venue — not simply because this was his teenage dream come true, but for professional reasons. After all, he designed the amphitheater that finally brought his all-time favorite band to Bahrain. Eleven years ago, Lockman was a working architect with experience designing private villas and rebuilding 200-year-old structures. Around that time, Eric Clapton came to Bahrain, playing the country’s half-millennium-old Arad Fort and selling it out in minutes. Clapton’s 2014 concert demonstrated two thing…",

This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next.

An enterprising developer recently released an app called LibrePods , which enables a more feature-rich AirPods experience on Android.

McCall Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the universe held together by gravity, containing up to several thousand individual galaxies and huge reservoirs of superheated, X-ray-emitting gas. The mass of this hot gas is typically about five times higher than the total mass of all the galaxies in galaxy clusters. In addition to these visible components, 80% of the mass of galaxy clusters is supplied by dark matter. These cosmic giants are bellwethers not only for the galaxies, stars and black holes within them, but also for the evolution and growth of the universe itself. It is no surprise then that NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed many galaxy clusters over the lifetime of the mission. Chandra’s X-ray vision allows it to see the enormous stockpiles of hot cluster gas, with temperatures as high as 100 million degrees, with exquisite clarity.

AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web. The interface is quite similar to the web implementation, showing the same Meet AI Mode heading and “Ask anything” text box.",

Similarly, there have been speculations about the chip of choice, with leaks suggesting Samsung might equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the other two models, with an Exynos chip instead of a Snapdragon in some regions. While the launch date remains uncertain, a recent certification might put speculation about the chipset to rest. The Galaxy S26 Ultra recently visited the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), which certified it ahead of the launch. The certification document (via The Tech Outlook ) includes different variants carrying SM-S948B, SM-S948B/DS, SM-S948U, and SM-S948U1, where U refers to the US variant, while B refers to the international variant…",

Same here. At this point, I think that the best accessory you can buy for your Samsung Galaxy Watch is not a strap, a charger, or a case. It is the Galaxy Fit 3 . Yes, the roughly $50 fitness tracker . And yes, I understand how silly it is to claim another wearable as an accessory to a smartwatch. But hear me out, because this might genuinely be the best quality-of-life hack I’ve added to my Galaxy setup in years. The Galaxy Fit 3 is an easier bedmate than a watch",
