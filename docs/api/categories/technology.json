    "body": "Apple's relentless in-house silicon release schedule continues this week with the announcement of the new M5 chip . And early leaked benchmarks of the chip suggest the new M5 is about twice as fast as the original M1 for single-thread performance. So, the question is, why can't PC CPUs make those kinds of gains? The immediate context here is the accuracy of the leaked benchmark and the actual performance gains of PC processors over the same time period. So, first off, the leaked numbers look plausible. That's because the M4 already had very high single-thread performance and the M5 leaked numbers look to have pushed that on 10% to 15% depending on which precise Apple platforms you are comparing. Now you might dismiss 10% to 15% as your usual generational gain similar to PC chips. And it is. Except Apple is iterating on a nearly annual basis, with the M1 launching in November 2020 and the M5 now with us in late 2025. Intel and AMD tend to take two years to release major new architectures. That more rapid Apple cadence adds up pretty fast as the years tick by. How fast? To put numbers onto this, the M1 does about 2,200 points in Geekbench 6 single-thread , the M5 is looking like aro…",

We already knew Tinkerbell and Snow White would be a part of the DLC as they were shown in the original trailer, but Tigger and Cruella de Vil will now be joining us too. Both will play a significant part in the story, with Cruella essentially taking the role of the villain having left the ranch to decay over time. Tigger, however, will be lost somewhere amongst the new biomes of the map and it will be our job to find him. Unlike the Storybook Vale DLC, Wishblossom Ranch won't be split into parts either so you'll be able to unlock all the characters from day one. Two new horses have also been showcased.

See, present-day Minecraft has a few core principles. The relevant ones to everyone's least favourite critter are \"be fair to players\", \"bad things can happen, but they're technically the player's fault\", \"find the right level of destruction\", and \"don't add features that wreck player's builds.\" If you're sitting here thinking 'hey, wait a second, those are all things that the Creeper does!' then you'd be right. As Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten says in the video linked above, \"If you followed the rules we have today, you would probably not add the creeper, because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster that would show up and just destroy what you built.\" However, the \"creeper is very iconic\", which seems in direct conflict with all those lovely pre-established rules.

The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing. Instead, the proportion of AI-generated articles has remained relatively stable over the last 12 months.

It can feel like running through treacle trying to rank up, level weapons for attachments, and perhaps most painful of all, to complete the many arduous assignments—not helped by a prominent bug causing assignments not to track . Whether through fear of players unlocking everything right away and getting bored, or in an effort to curtail those who would inevitably use Portal as an XP farm , it's not working out well for anyone. Portal servers totally aren't inundated with private bot matches to cheese progression to the point that this creative mode isn't actually serving its purpose.

We already had an idea of what, and more specifically who, would be coming as part of this update thanks to a teaser shared earlier in the year, but it's nice to finally see the characters in-game. The Winter Ball will bring Cinderella to the game, one of the characters players have been desperate to invite to their valley since it launched. Even though the roster gets bigger every single year, there's still a pretty significant lack of original princesses, so having updates like this one is always exciting, even though we've still got a couple of months to wait before we get to meet her. The showcase also gave some info on who else will show up as we unlock Cinderella. You can expect to spend a lot of time working alongside the Fairy Godmother, a character who has been available since the game first released, in quests that involve getting her to remember her past. The Dark Castle was shown briefly in the trailer, so you…",

Battlefield 6 's devs have re-affirmed my decision to not get into coding with its latest bug. As spotted by Eurogamer , BF6 players have been suffering a weapon glitch that makes it harder for them to aim—see, in most FPS games, the longer you hold down the trigger, the worse your aim gets. This is called 'spread' or 'bloom', and it's usually accounted for by not shooting for a little bit, giving your poor virtual soldier's tired arms a li'l break. The Gunplay in Battlefield 6 feels rough sometimes because it is still not working correctly. Spread/bloom is not resetting correctly. #Battlefield6 - Example: pic.twitter.com/ymILTAzh6v October 14, 2025 Except, in Battlefield 6, it'll sometimes just not reset at all—as shown in the clip above .

Motorslice's demo has been out for a while now, but it was recently updated for Steam Next Fest . Its controls seem unwieldy at first, but they're mostly just demanding. Chainsaw-blade-wielding protagonist P controls a lot like Lara Croft in the early Tomb Raider games. That is to say, all of her movements are incredibly high-commitment, and you need to know exactly where you're going. That's not to say the game's controls are perfect, yet.

When said lawyer opposed the claims, they were then accused of defending their use of AI with, well, AI (via 404 Media ). Or, to put it more succinctly, in the words of judge Joel Coehn: \"Counsel relied upon unvetted AI—in his telling, via inadequately supervised colleagues—to defend his use of unvetted AI.\" The case itself involved a dispute between family members and a defaulted loan, usually a relatively straightforward proceeding. However, once the plaintiff brought to the court's attention the apparently AI-generated citations and quotes in the defense counsel's brief, the defense claimed that \"these passages were intended as paraphrases or summarized statements of the legal principles established in the cited authorities.\" The judge points out that the purported paraphrases included \"bracketed terms to indicate departure from a quotation (not something one would expect to see in an intended paraphrase) and comments such a…",

This might make you consider upgrading to Windows 11 because, well, this will be the very last time you'll be able to get a security update like this unless you get Extended Security Updates for a year (via Bleeping Computer ). Thankfully this isn't too difficult, though, as if you're logged into your Microsoft account and syncing your settings, you can opt-in for free via your Windows Settings. This patch applies regardless, though. The latest patch includes fixes for zero-day exploits including privilege escalation, secure boot bypass, memory corruption, and TPM information retrieval. 'Zero-day' means these exploits were discovered and exploitable before there was a fix released for them, meaning systems have been vulnerable to these ones until now.

It seems GOG had to make a few persuasion rolls to get Capcom to agree to it.

Given what we've had before in Borderlands 3, it was still a big improvement, and I even found myself charmed by one or two character moments. Not a terrible swerve from the outdated-on-launch memes, all told. The folks at Gearbox are happy with the feedback, too—Sam Winkler, the game's narrative lead, comments at a dev panel in Pax Australia 2025 (thanks, GamesRadar+ ): \"It's been great! It's been really good—I'll be honest, I'm really happy with it.\" And hey, you know what, Winkler isn't wrong to feel that way.

The reason is clear enough: demand from AI. \"Our competitors in the fight for supply are no longer our peers, but giant CSPs (cloud service providers),\" Chen said. By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output . Moreover, the AI-driven surge in demand is prompting manufacturers to prioritise production capacity for high-margin applications. Sound familiar? It's all rather too reminiscent of the GPU market for comfort, and we know what happened to graphics card prices in the last few years. Ouch.

You play as Pon, a tanuki responsible for delivering mail across four bright, summery Japanese towns.

With the pocket money you earn from your part-time job at the post office, alongside the minigames you can complete around the town, you can purchase decorations to make the shrine as magical as it should be before the festival. When you start the demo, your first task is stacking packages and letters into your bag which you then need to deliver.
