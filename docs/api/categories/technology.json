    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority We’re seven to eight years into the foldable experiment now, and it’s pretty clear that the product category is here to stay. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 was one of the biggest success stories of 2025, and companies aren’t letting up with Samsung and HUAWEI already chasing down the tri-fold market. But it still feels like foldables are partly experimental, or at least a bit of a niche category. They’re very expensive, they’re still relatively fragile, and they’re not the most practical phone to use day-to-day. If you’re curious about them but you’re not willing to commit, I stumbled on the best way for you to experiment with foldables without breaking the bank. How? A new Pixel Fold costs $560 now on Amazon , or $420 renewed, and it’s the best deal in mobile tech these days. I say this with certainty because I have one and I’ve been using it for a week to see how it holds up and how it compares to newer foldables.",
