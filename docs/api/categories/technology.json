    "body": "There's a good chance you know AI as that thing your grandpa uses to get information wrong, and also that thing that has caused the value of Nvidia to skyrocket. As OpenAI, Meta, and even the US government continue their investment in the technology, fears have sprung up that the bubble will burst and all that infrastructure will come down alongside it. But Arvind Krishna, the CEO of the huge technology company IBM, thinks Nvidia's Jensen Huang has the ability to shift the company if and when the time comes.

We can't ignore the fact that we've already had a new map, two new killer robots, and three quests , and there's even more lined up in the roadmap .

In that same story we reported that Micron, the other big player in memory, is planning to ramp up production that won't be online until late 2028.

Both of those keyboards were in the Swiss brand's more traditional wheelhouse, opting for a conventional low-profile switch, plus creature comforts such as solid build quality and fast wireless connectivity. The all-new G515 Rapid TKL isn't in that wheelhouse, though. Its switches are no longer standard low-profile mechanical ones, and instead are low-profile magnetic analogue ones. That means all the fun of rapid trigger and its clever software trickery into an already short and snappy travel. I'll get to those switches in a minute. As I mentioned a minute ago, this keyboard is an example of the Logitech-flavoured cake being given to you but not consumed, in that it sacrifices any form of wireless connectivity.

Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn. The new iteration of Gemini looks to best ChatGPT in several key areas, including critical analysis, strategic reasoning, and overall performance.

He then explained why things are also looking up for 14A. \"From everything I’ve seen—and all the Intel customers I’ve talked to—I’m very confident that Intel will use 18A to successfully produce tens of millions of leading-edge chips in the Panther Lake family and beyond in the near term.
