I spent the 15 hours or so it took me to slay my way through 2,580 enemies in Ninja Gaiden 4 hoping that I'd arrive at the answers to two questions: Does it feel like a proper sequel to Ninja Gaiden (2004) and Ninja Gaiden 2 (2008), which are both on my shortlist of the finest action games ever made?

I have found why. Turn Uniform Infantry Aiming Off, scroll down to find zoom sensitivity smoothing, turn that off.

Little Nightmares 3 is the first game of the series to be developed by Supermassive Games rather than Tarsier Studios. Despite this change, it certainly looks the exact same as the other two games.

At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases.

Even if I have the right media, what the hell am I supposed to do with a floppy disk image in 2025? The long-running answer has been to try out DOSBox and its modern \"forks,\" or modified versions, but it can be a bit of a pain to get started if you're new to emulation. Enter DOSBox Pure , once an impressive core for the open-source emulation frontend RetroArch—if that sounds like gibberish, it just means you go outside enough—now a standalone app that can easily load ZIP files, mounted CD and floppy disk images, DOS exes, and so on. It's a pay-what-you-want download on developer Schelling 's itch.io page, and after giving it a quick look myself, the app is slick and straightforward right out of the box. There's step-by-step use instructions on that page as well if you have any trouble getting your games running⁠—you'll have to bring your own files, with storefronts like GOG being one potential source. From there it's got plenty of modern settings to tweak and soup up your DOS games of choice: rebi…",

Two heavy hitters—the reboot of Bungie's venerable shooter Marathon and Embark's fresh up-and-comer Arc Raiders —are nearly here, and both have had a chance to gear up with playtests. Speaking with PC Gamer US editor-in-chief Tyler Wilde, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said the shared timing made for a fortuitous opportunity. \"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen,\" Watkins said. \"It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.\" Of course, Arc Raiders and Marathon are different games, but it's hard not to compare the two. Timing aside, when PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park played both back-to-back earlier this year, he noted \"both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit,\" adding he was \"skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.\" For Watki…",

The technology's experimental use in the arts has already seen the advent of AI \"musicians\" like The Velvet Sundown , and you might wonder whether a veteran like Uematsu would be allured or even threatened by the ability to spin melodies so quickly with generative AI tools. As reported by Automaton , Uematsu told JASRAC he \"never used AI and probably never will … music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections.\" Uematsu has shared concerns about the changing face of videogame music before. Last year, he said there's a worrisome wave of game directors content with \"Hollywood-style\" music, adding even then that AI tools would prevent composers from \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\" More recently, he lamented a perceived stagnation in game music, with too many composers aping John Williams.

As gaming roadmaps go, it's closer to what you'd scribble on the back of a packet of ciggies than the cartographical masterpieces produced by Ordnance Survey , with Techland's plans stretching over just 11 weeks. But this pencil-scrawl to your local newsagent nonetheless has a few landmarks worth visiting between now and the end of the year. The most significant of these is probably new game plus, which Techland describes as being \"highly anticipated\" in its Steam post detailing the roadmap. Personally, the absolute last thing I want to do after putting a 30+ hour game to bed is immediately start playing it again, but it appears I am in the minority on this. Elsewhere, the next few weeks will also introduce 'Legend Levels', a new nightmare difficulty, extra weapon executions, and ray tracing on PC. Techland doesn't specify precisely when each of these updates will arrive, but my guess is they'll be drip-fed alongside the roadmap's initial reveal—a series of weekly community challenges Techland has dubbed 'Call of the Beast'. These will provide players with reward…",
