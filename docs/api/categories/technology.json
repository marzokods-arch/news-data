Most apps and services aim for feature parity between the two platforms, and when they don’t, it’s often iPhones that win, not Android phones — sadly. But that’s not the case with one particular Spotify feature that only exists on Android because it could technically only exist on Android: App shortcuts. I’m specifically talking about the ability to make unlimited home screen app shortcuts for any Spotify artist or album. Let me walk you through it.",

The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing.

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average.

As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports.

While the issue remains unexplained, some people point to possible HDR format incompatibility. While iOS 26.2 doesn’t fix it, some folks have also figured out a fix Apple has long attempted to keep Android and related services out of reach for its users . That friction inadvertently impacts users switching from an Android device to an iPhone or using both OSes at the same time. Now, it appears iOS bugs may also lean into those biases. Several iPhone users noticed an unexplained iOS 26 bug that changes the colors of pictures taken on Android devices and shared with them. Numerous reports on Reddit say that their pictures, when viewed in the iOS Photos app, turn red when they zoom in on the image. The same does not occur while viewing the images on a device running iOS 18.",

With this update, the model will be better at handling complex workflows, navigating user instructions, and holding natural-sounding conversations. This update has started rolling out to Gemini Live, Search Live, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI. Google’s AI, Gemini , already makes talking to a virtual assistant feel more natural than it did when commanding Google Assistant. But nothing is perfect, so there’s always room for improvement. Gemini is now getting a few updates to improve its conversational quality. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
