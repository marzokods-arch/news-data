All students on the premises at 7:23 PM were checked by the police officers, and no gun was found. It wasn't until three minutes after apprehending the students that the police officers spotted a blue bag of Doritos in the bin, and put together what had gone wrong. The Omnilert AI gun detection system, which monitors the school's cameras, alerted the school that a gun may be on the grounds, and the authorities were informed as a result.

The Outer Worlds 2, despite getting a solid thumbs up by resident RPG sicko Ted Litchfield in his review , is no exception. See, the $100 premium edition of the game gives you access to Obsidian's latest five whole days early. Also, to be fair, a few bonuses that are technically worth the price—two future DLCs, access to the artbook and soundtrack, and a couple of bundles with armours and weapons in them. Standard stuff. Oh, and also the privilege of Obsidian sticking its tongue out at you and going ner-ner. See, in The Outer Worlds 2, you can pick up optional \"Flaws\". These are typically curse/kiss debuffs with a slight upside, forcing you to play around them—and they're typically triggered by certain in-game events.

The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case.

If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise.

This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.
