He explained that the symptoms began after a show in New Orleans, where he experienced a sudden, intense head pain and blurred vision. Despite performing through the discomfort, he later sought medical attention in Houston, where doctors informed him he had experienced a stroke. “I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,” he told the crowd. “I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’” He added that his first reaction was thinking he had “let everybody down,” before joking that he felt like he was “copying Jamie Foxx” — whose own stroke in 2023 made global headlines.

Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",

I think about all the great Android launchers I’ve tried in the past, all the interesting approaches to finding and interacting with my apps and widgets, and then I accept my fate and stick with the default option, again and again. It’s not that I think the Pixel Launcher is perfect or that the other options don’t have excellent features I envy. Quite the contrary. But there’s something comforting in Google’s approach, so here’s why I stick with it despite knowing there are better options out there.",

Since the first crew arrived on Nov. 2, 2000, NASA and its partners have conducted thousands of research investigations and technology demonstrations to advance exploration of the Moon and Mars and benefit life on Earth. Researchers have taken advantage of the unique microgravity environment to conduct experiments impossible to replicate on Earth, transforming research across disciplines. More than 4,000 experiments have pushed the boundaries of science, sparked discoveries, and driven scientific breakthroughs. &#8220;25 years ago, Expedition 1 became the first crew to call the International Space Station home, beginning a period of continuous human presence in space that still continues to this day,” said NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy. “This historic milestone would not have been possible without NASA and its partners, as well as every astronaut and engineer who works to keep the lights on in low Earth orbit.” To celebrate a quarter century of inno…",

If it were up to Apple, I and many others like me might never have seen this day.

These star-tracking cameras are used for maintaining spacecraft orientation. Within the camera’s field of view — representing 0.1% of the full sky around the spacecraft — Uranus is visible as a larger dot near the left side of the image. Figure A is an annotated version of the image with Uranus and several background stars labeled. NASA/JPL-Caltech Figure B is an animated GIF made of a pair of images taken 10 hours apart. In this version, Uranus can be seen moving very slightly, relative to the background stars. NASA/JPL-Caltech At the time the images were taken, Europa Clipper was about 2 billion miles (3.2 billion kilometers) from Uranus. The spacecraft is currently e…",

    "body": "NASA/Lori Losey NASA’s X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft took off for its historic first flight on Oct. 28, 2025, at 11:14 a.m. EDT from Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in Palmdale, California. The one-of-a-kind aircraft flew for 67 minutes before landing and taxiing to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. NASA test pilot Nils Larson flew the X-59 up to an altitude of about 12,000 feet and an approximate top speed of 230 mph, precisely as planned. The plane’s landing gear remained down during the entire flight, a common practice for experimental aircraft flying for the first time. Now that the X-59&#8217;s first flight is in the books, the team is focused on preparing for a series of test flights where the aircraft will operate at higher altitudes and supersonic speeds.&nbsp;This test flight phase of NASA&#8217;s Quesst mission will ensure the X-59 meets performance and safety expectations. Through the Quesst mission, NASA aims to usher in a new age of quiet supersonic flight, achieved through the unique design and technology of the X-59 in future supersonic transport aircraft.

Comet offers full voice support for interacting with Perplexity. Right now, companies are putting AI in everything — for better or for worse. And while we don’t have to look far to find some particularly ridiculous solutions it’s been shoehorned into, we’ve quickly come to realize that AI in a web browser makes a lot of sense. As a result, lots of companies have been developing their own solutions, and earlier this year we checked out Perplexity’s Comet browser for desktop PCs. Ever since, we’ve been looking forward to getting to use Comet on Android — and now, the floodgates are finally opening. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
