The classic desktop designed for mouse and keyboard was gone, based on a prediction that soon everyone would want to use all their devices in the same way (this has still not come to pass). At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development. It was truly the nadir of Windows' 40 year history—and is now proof that there's an audience for literally everything, because someone has made a Windows 8 desktop environment for Linux.

But I've tested it, and it's true. This saga all started when a viewer of streamer Nickmercs noticed Nick's aim snapped onto Arcs (the bots in the game) as he was shooting. Nick uses a controller, which is key to the whole affair. After some took to accusing the previous Faze member of cheating , others discovered that the aim assist for controller players appears to be stronger in Arc Raiders, the higher your fps is. With the PC Gamer RTX 5070 Ti rig, I set everything to low, dynamic lighting to static, and resolution to 1080p and managed to get up to 300 fps without frame generation.

This is a system that we're not just setting up to last for the launch of Midnight, but for years to come.\" Vice president and executive producer Holly Longdale says the feature, which launched in early access December 2, immediately captivated both players and developers. \"I've worked in housing systems before, and I'm so proud of the team because we're almost a victim of our own success,\" she says. \"There is a giant backlog [of requests], and I think every time the housing team does an interview or reads comments, oh, we're adding another one to the list.

But the impact of the buyout was incommensurate with its cost. For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

Right now Elder Scrolls fans are huffing the copium thanks to a Microsoft tease that 2026 will be a \" big year for games ending in 6 \", but the reality is there's no indication what date Bethesda is aiming for with the next Elder Scrolls. That's one hell of a stretch, even for a marquee title, and our man reckons it's because Bethesda didn't want Starfield's debut to be overshadowed by the absence of The Elder Scrolls. \"My assumption was always that we were announcing Starfield,\" says Purkeypile, \"and it had been so long already since Skyrim that we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us. It’s a very expensive way to do that, though.

The R-72 Censor is a semi-auto precision rifle with an integrated suppressor for taking out enemies undetected at long range. For quietly clearing an area at closer quarters, there's also the AR-59 Suppressor, a silenced full-auto assault rifle. Technically speaking, the Redacted Regiment weapons won't be Helldivers 2's first suppressed primaries: That honor goes to the M7S SMG that was added with the ODST crossover warbond.

Statements have sometimes even contradicted each other. For example, in the story I just linked, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund was quick to emphasise that the studio wasn't using it to \"replace people\", even though replacing work you'd otherwise need a voice actor to come in and record is, uh, doing that. He then goes on to talk effusively about how Embark couldn't have made its two games without it, which strikes me as strange—either you replaced work that would've cost money you didn't have, or you didn't do that. I digress: You might think that after gathering some success, Embark would keep banging that drum. But in a recent interview with PCGN , …",

Trump said his administration is working with AI companies in unspecified ways to ensure this does not happen.

SK Hynix is one of Nvidia's leading suppliers of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for its AI accelerators. The planned chip packaging facility is set to begin construction this April, but won't be able to address demand until after work is complete in late 2027 (via Bloomberg ). This follows news last year of the company committing an additional $500 billion to building four new memory fabs , with the first of these aiming for a similar 2027 completion window. Chey Tae-won, the chairman of SK Hynix's parent group, SK Group, recently spoke during a keynote speech at the SK AI Summit in Seoul, saying, \"We have entered an era in which supply is facing a bottleneck. We are receiving memory chip supply requests from many companies, and we are thinking hard about how to address all demands.” With the limited flow of memory now actively restricting how many data centres can be built, it's not the only company announcing pla…",

Originally planned to roll out in December, the DIY microtransactions didn't end up going live until January 9 , immediately after which things started going sideways.
