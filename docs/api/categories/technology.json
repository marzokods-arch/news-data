    "body": "I'm beginning to think I have far-too-strong feelings about changes to Steam minutiae. Why? Because when I heard that Valve had finally unleashed its updated storefront from beta, I fired up the site so quickly you'd have thought it was giving out candy. No one should care this much about website UI updates. I do. This is my cross to bear. Anyway, Steam's storefront update is out of beta and the frontpage is a whole lot slicker now. Also, wider. Valve has merged the two constituent parts of its old UI—that big list of categories down the left-hand side and the blue bar up top—into a single easy-to-navigate bar. As part of that merge, the Categories section now displays, well, actual categories. Before, when it was consigned to the sidebar, the Steam categories you could select consisted of things like \"Top sellers,\" and \"New releases.\" Now, hovering over the new Categories display section shows much more useful game genres, letting you easily browse by things like racing, stealth, and what-have-you. Also, the categories that appear are personalised for you, which is either very convenient or yet another intrusion by the dead hand of surveillance capitalism. Whichever you prefer. I…",

This is especially true when it comes to frame generation, as Intel has a system that's better than AMD's, even though it's far behind in discrete GPU sales. And if the naming of some software configuration code is anything to go by, Intel might even have something planned to put its frame gen tech on par with Nvidia's. The code in question is an 'extensible application markup language' file that Intel uses to configure how its Graphics Software app. It basically determines which menus, options, etc, get shown for whatever Arc graphics cards or iGPU you have in your PC. Sharp-eyed Redditor Organic-Bird-587 noticed something distinctly unusual in the wording of one section. (Image credit: Intel) You can see the heading for the code section clearly states 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', and the reason why this is noteworthy is because Intel's current implementation of XeSS Frame Generation isn't 'multi' at all; the algorithm only creates a single frame, just like AMD's system does.

With something like Peak , where you need to all be present at the very start of the game, the chances of everyone being ready at the time we've agreed to is next to none. So, having ways to pass the time while you wait for someone to make a cup of tea, eat their dinner, or return from the heavy fog they've somehow disappeared into in the time it took for them to reply to a message and join the game, is essential. However, the opportunities to pass time in the airport before you set off on your climbing adventure in Peak are incredibly limited. Or at least they were until now. You have a climbing wall, and aside from running up and down the travelator, you're stuck for any activities really. Luckily, the \"Dillydally mini-update\" has rolled out, adding two new games to the airport to keep you entertained until it's time to head off. You'll now be able to make use of a basketball court and chess board, which is bound to distract my friends even further before we actually get to climb any mountains. Although you…",

Even me, even considering I liked the first Watch Dogs and liked the third Watch Dogs and have a few pleasant if foggy memories of the second Watch Dogs. I'm sure I'll watch the movie out of curiosity (or because my boss makes me review it) but it does feel like it's arriving about a decade too late. That's because it's arriving about a decade too late. The Watch Dogs movie was announced back in 2013, the same year as the Harlem Shake, and Beyonce lip-syncing at Obama's first inauguration, and the Game of Thrones show's Red Wedding. That's how damn long ago this movie was announced . More perspective: 2013 was the year Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag came out. Ubisoft has released eight more Assassin's Creed games since the Watch Dogs movie was greenlit. So, yeah, it took quite a while to get rolling, but last year we got confirmation that filming was actually underway , and we've now gotten confirmation that filming has wrapped (at least mostly) and we may actually get to see this gosh darn movie at some point before we're planted.

Palworld is collaborating with Ultrakill, a brilliant indie shooter by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala that's still in early access itself, and continuing to blow minds (the game sits at \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam with roughly 120K user reviews). Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together.

Today, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms dropped a new trailer revealing the \"Rogue Angel\" game mode, and it teases just enough to make me think, well, maybe not, too. Rogue Angel is a co-op roguelike mode that sets teams of players off to battle demons in \"a twisted new realm of Purgatory, where procedurally generated arenas, unpredictable drops, and brutal enemies await. Each death offers a lesson. Every run improves your skills. Every step brings you closer to becoming unstoppable.\" I felt things start to go sideways almost immediately, when someone in the trailer declared, \"Let's go—on me!\" as if she was calling the shots in some unnamed modern military shooter and not a descent into the warped bowels of Hell. Subsequent dialog does not elevate the situation: Barks like \"hold your ground,\" \"just warming up,\" and \"that is one ugly creature\" are generic and flat in equal measure, but equally awkward—for me, an old-time Painkiller enjoyer, at least—is the sense that they really don't belong here at all.

Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard.

The Frame 4500X isn't about modesty. No fishtank case really is. You can't hide anything with a window quite this large onto your PC's components. It's a great way to showcase your build, however, and the Frame 4500X wears it well. I've shown a few people this case since building a PC into it for testing, and it quite literally has the wow factor (both people said 'wow' out loud—very satisfying). There's also a flowing design to the vents, sweeping from the rear of the top panel and down to the front of the side panel. This helps let the case and cooling solution breathe, but, very importantly, helps keep the non-windowed side of the case exciting and more of a match for the windowed side.

    "body": "It's no secret that the process behind the manufacturing of high-end processors is becoming ever more expensive with each advance in technology. The huge outlay in buildings and machinery, as well as years of research and development, runs into tens of billions of dollars. However, one report claims that TMSC plans to raise the price for its next-generation N2 process node so much that processors made on it will have to be a lot more expensive to cover the cost. That's according to China Times (via Dan Nystedt on X ), which claims that industry sources have told them that the price for TSMC's N2 process node will be more than 50% higher than N3. It notes that the Taiwanese firm's current best node, N3P, is around 20% higher than the previous generation N5. Price increases in semiconductor wafer manufacturing are inevitable, especially when it concerns the very best process nodes. That's because all of the equipment used to make the wafers has to be better than the apparatus used for earlier nodes. For example, Dutch company ASML develops and makes the photolithographic machines used in wafer making, and its latest and greatest system costs a cool $400 million per unit . While TSMC…",

    "body": "Big tech is capable of throwing around some eye-watering amounts of cash. As you may recall, Nvidia announced $46.7 billion total revenue during its Q2 2025 earnings call. That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power. As such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres. The two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket. Once this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10…",
