That's why Nvidia makes and sells a cut-back version of the GPU to China—first the RTX 5090D and then the RTX 5090D V2, the latter having launched just a couple of months ago . But there's been talk (and specifically images) of MSI RTX 5090 graphics cards ending up in China, so MSI has just clarified that \"MSI has never officially sold or distributed the GeForce RTX 5090 in China.\" Amidst back-and-forth tariffs and restrictions in the US-China trade war over the last few months, there have been reports of big smuggling operations running restricted AI chips into China. For instance, earlier in the year a Financial Times investigation suggested at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs were shipped to China during strict export controls, and there have even been arrests in a different case regarding exports of \"tens of millions of dollars’ worth of sensitive microchips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications\" over the last three years.

ADATA's Chen Libai has said that supplies of all the major memory and storage technologies—DRAM, NAND, and HDD—are now in shortage. Chen says it's the first time that has happened in 30 years. The reason is clear enough: demand from AI. \"Our competitors in the fight for supply are no longer our peers, but giant CSPs (cloud service providers),\" Chen said. By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output . Moreover, the AI-driven surge in demand is prompting manufacturers to prioritise production capacity for high-margin applications. Sound familiar? It's all rather too reminiscent of the GPU market for comfort, and we know what happened to graphics card prices in the last few years. Ouch.

But now, having played its (albeit too brief) demo, I am thrilled that it feels like it'll live up to my expectations. You play as Pon, a tanuki responsible for delivering mail across four bright, summery Japanese towns. As summer starts coming to a close though, the Tanuki Festival gets closer, and the shrine has been left in disrepair. With the pocket money you earn from your part-time job at the post office, alongside the minigames you can complete around the town, you can purchase decorations to make the shrine as magical as it should be before the festival. When you start the demo, your first task is stacking packages and letters into your bag which you then need to deliver. This is done through a Tetris-esque puzzle, dragging pieces from the shelves into a grid which represents the space in your bag. It's easy enough, I didn't have to rotate any blocks or spend muc…",

Or something else entirely? In an interview with PC World , Intel's long-suffering graphics rep Tom Petersen has tried to clear things up. But we've come away if anything more confused. And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage. Another oddity is that while the slide refers to both Xe2 and Battlemage, it only calls out Xe3 and not the \"Celestial\" generational codename that has previously been attached to Xe3.

The biggest issue right now, however, is that it's a Sisyphean task: there's a prevalent bug preventing assignments tracking whatsoever for some players, or not tracking accurately in other cases. Healing 5,000 damage from teammates or getting kills while buffed by a stim is one thing, but when none of it is counted and you're not making any progress at all, it's a frustrating mess.

    "body": "Minecraft's Mounts of Mayhem drop will mark the game's fourth update this year, and even though we've only got surface-level information about what's included, a few of its most appealing features are now available to test with Java edition. This includes getting hands-on with the brand new Spear weapon, alongside a new weapon enchantment we haven't heard about yet: the Lunge. Details on the lunge enchantment for the spear have been shared in an official blog post about the update. This enchantment gives you a burst of speed when using the weapon, which you can take advantage of in combat to deliver hits to any mobs that might be challenging to fight with a sword. But, you can also use the enchantment to travel around the overworld a lot faster, which is bound to save your hunger from rapidly depleting if you run around on foot. Other features available to test in this snapshot include the Nautilus, which you will now be able to go and tame and ride around the ocean, alongside the Zombie Nautilus which we now know is tameable. We knew that this mob would have a zombified version, but the fact you can actually keep one for yourself is exciting. Similarly, you'll also be able to go …",

As the game grew in size and complexity, it became increasingly unstable, and Arrowhead said in September that it had plans to address it. Arrowhead dropped a new video today that covers how future updates will roll out. In order to fix the most egregious issues and to keep the game stable, game director Mikael Erikkson says major new updates will be a little slower to appear. \"We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in,\" Erikkson explains. \"And also we want to make sure that we update the game in ways that are more stable, in ways that are noticeable for players with every new update that we do.\" Erikkson says some of the issues can be addressed \"fairly quickly,\" but that other things will take more time. \"We're already making really big improvements,\" he says, and details on what those are will be discussed soon.

And that idea is now changing many core aspects of the game, its director says. In an exclusive PC Gamer interview, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas says that over the years, the game has gotten increasingly complex. He goes on to explain upcoming changes to encounter and class design. \"If you're playing it out of the box, no addons whatsoever, and trying to play at the highest competitive levels, I do think that it is too hard,\" he says, \"and I think that consequently, hardly anyone is attempting to do that.\" Midnight aims to change that dynamic. Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions. But the idea of taking away mods and WeakAuras' ability to read combat information swiftly required tweaks to nearly every part of the game's group activities.

A team of scientists at Fudan University in Shanghai have published a study detailing their latest achievement, a fully functional memory chip built with integrated 2D materials a few atoms thick. Yesssss. This is the Star Trek-level technology I was promised as a child. Well, maybe that's jumping the gun a bit. Still, the achievement here is incredibly impressive (via Tom's Hardware ). Essentially, the researcher's new Atom2chip process allowed them to flow a layer of molybdenum disulphide , functioning as a memory array, on top of a 0.13 micrometre CMOS silicon chip—fusing together an emerging atomic-scale, \"2D\" technology with traditional methods to create a working hybrid memory chip. The chip-riding 2D flash memory array is able to communicate with the CMOS chip's control logic via a custom interface, which in turn means that instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism and random access instructions can be swapped between the two. And the deeper you go, the more impressive the scale of the achievement becomes. While wafers are polished…",
