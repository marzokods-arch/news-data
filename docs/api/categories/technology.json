Mass production has apparently begun, and 400,000–600,000 units are expected per year. Deckard, for those unaware, is Valve's long-, long-, long -anticipated VR headset that's expected to be a standalone device not requiring PC power, unlike the Valve Index . We first caught wind of it back in June 2022, thanks to a December 2021 patent application . Since then, we've had rumour after rumour, including that 'Roy' controllers for Deckard were being tooled last year, that Valve was importing VR manufacturing equipment into the US earlier this year , and that some influencers recently travelled to Seattle and were a little cryptic about it. It's one of those things that has been on the cards for such a long time that it has somehow seemed to be imminently approaching, and yet also a little like a fable we'll never see the real sight of.

That's because, according to some researchers (via Igor's Lab ) our optical gaming mice might be able to spy on what we're saying. And is it a surprise that this fiendish development is aided by AI? Not to me, it's not. Judging from the video demonstration above, the real magic occurs in the last stage of the pipeline, where the neural model cleans up the speech even better than the Wiener filter does (no sniggering, that's a serious scientific term ). Apparently this method of snooping can be performed on \"consumer-grade mice with high-fidelity sensors\", which sounds a lot like \"gaming mouse\" to me. That does seem to be exactly the case, as in the full paper (pdf warning) we can see the researchers used a Razer Viper at 8 kHz polling to train the models used for this attack. I suppose one of the key requirements is a high polling rate, as a higher polling rate means more data, which means more accurate data clean-up to isolate acoustics, ie, speech: \"Attackers can exploit these sensors’ ever-increasing pol…",

Dimon firstly says he's \"far more worried than others\" about a serious market correction, also known as a crash, which \"could be six months, could be two years\" away. He broadly reckons that the US stock markets are overheated, and says \"the level of uncertainty in most peoples' minds should be higher.\" This isn't all about AI: Dimon cites \"a lot of things out there\" like the geopolitical situation, fiscal spending and remilitarisation, a topic he seems quite keen on. \"All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,\" he said. \"So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal.\" Dimon says his internal sense of the probabilities would be \"a higher probability than the market and maybe others… i…",

The Panther Lake trio (Image credit: Intel) With Meteor Lake, Lunar Lake, and Arrow Lake, Intel created a single processor design and used binning strategies to create broad processor families from them. For example, one LNL chip can be found in nine different Core Ultra 200V CPUs. Not so with Panther Lake, because while binning will still be used to produce all the different models (i.e. some will have disabled cores, others will just be clocked lower), there are three chip designs in total. PTL '8 core': 4 …",

Exactly how soon is yet to be confirmed, and it's not clear whether XeSS 3 will have any other notable additions or improvements. However, XeSS-MFG is definitely coming, and in games that already support XeSS-FG , you'll be able to enable 3x or 4x frame generation. This can be either in the game itself or via Intel's Graphics Software application. As it so happens, Intel has sneakily been hinting at multi-frame generation for several months, but it's only very recently that this was noticed. Hidden away in a config file was a single line titled 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', but I just assumed that it was either a fairly generic label or that Intel wouldn't have anything to show for a good while. How wrong I was on both counts. So just what exactly is XeSS-MFG? Well, Intel's frame generation system works very much like Nvidia's does. The GPU renders a frame as normal and then st…",

To be more specific, we've been told what the system requirements are to have an 'Ultra++' gameplay experience and, while these requirements are no joke, EA isn't saying these will net you a mere 60 fps at 4K. No, if you have the system components required for Ultra++ gameplay, this should apparently net you 144 fps on High settings at 4K with DLSS upscaling turned on, or 240+ fps on Ultra settings at 4K with DLSS Multi Frame Generation (MFG) turned on. Achieving these frame rates at these settings will require an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor. It's interesting to note, that a Core Ultra 9 285K should achieve what the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can here, given the latter is much better for gaming. But I suppose at 4K on high and ultra settings, the CPU won't play anywhere near as large a part as the GPU. The way EA has laid out the requirements might be a little confusing, but the general gist is actually incredibly positive: Not much is really required at all to get the game running well.

Heart Machine doesn't go into detail about just what circumstances it's referring to, but it's not hard to deduce at least some of them. Unlike its previous games—Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash—which both enjoy popularity and acclaim, Hyper Light Breaker currently sits at a 64% Mixed user-review rating on Steam, and I suspect it will stay there or get worse with development coming to an end.

But those are just security updates; there will be no more feature updates for the OS and further support from developers for their apps will also slowly phase out, too. So, Windows 10 is effectively dunzo. And that fact has made me a little sadder than I thought it might. Not very sad—it's just an operating system—but a little. I was pondering why that is, because I tend to do just fine with Windows 11 and have used it pretty much since release. I think it's because of what it represents. It is, as you can see from my beautifully crafted headline above, the sound of the doors closing on the last time I felt my PC was truly my own.

In games, food can represent all sorts of things: a way to replenish health or stamina, a source of power-ups or buffs, or a skill to level up while cooking over a stove or campfire. A special meal can be a gift to bestow on an NPC you're in love with, a cultural milestone in a city builder, or even a way to assassinate someone—as with Oblivion's famous poisoned apples. Since every gamer is well-versed in the importance of food, I'm giving you a culinary challenge in today's quiz. Identify the 10 games below based only on a screenshot of their food. Time to see if you can cook! It's not as easy as it sounds—if you haven't played one of the games in the quiz, you probably won't recognize its edible items—but there should be enough context in the screenshots to give you some idea of what game it's from, even if you've never chowed down on it.

But when things start to get into the realm of cheating the system itself, and illicitly siphoning off money from the creator program, it turns out Epic's lawyers play a whole other ballgame. Fortnite has for many years hosted user-created experiences called islands, provides a suite of tools to make their creation as easy as possible, and then pays out money to the creators of the most popular maps. There are various metrics to determine payouts: session length, player count, and whether players go on to buy anything. This isn't chump change either: Epic says it pays out millions of dollars every year to community creators. So two miscreants took a look at that situation, and came up with a plan. Build some experiences, juice the player numbers through the roof with bots, and then sit back and profit. That's what Epic alleges in a new filing in Michigan against Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nas…",

Some of what players can expect includes: A new environment to explore with new enemy encounters and \"surprises to discover\". New boss battles for late-game players to challenge themselves with. New costumes for every member of the Expedition. UI game localisations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian. \"You can expect a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well\", which likely points towards an Esquie-focused addition (via Eurogamer ). \"It's not a super big DLC extension with hours of content. It's more of a thank-you gift from us,\" game director Guillaume Broche told Eurogamer. \"You will have quite a few things to do and collect…[and] some quality of life [additions] that are very highly requested by the community. \"We want to prepare a…",

Musk declared on Monday that his xAI game studio \"will release a great AI-generated game before the end of next year\". All of these are true things I just wrote. This is the world they have built for us. If the notion of the gooner Hitler robot generating your videogames doesn't sound great to you, you're in good company: Larian publishing lead and opinionated tweeter Michael Douse was one of the first industry figures to note that maybe Musk doesn't have quite the same grasp on the games industry as the guy he pays to play Path of Exile 2 for him . \"AI isn't going to solve the big problem of the industry, which is leadership and vision\", wrote Douse. In Douse's telling, what the games industry lacks more than anything is coherent vision and direction.

Getting swallowed by a sandworm once and losing everything permanently—my armor, my weapons, my loot, and my vehicle—was enough to make me tread the dunes of Dune as carefully as possible from then on. But that punishing permadeath for everything the sandworm swallows has been de-fanged, at least a little bit: a new patch for Funcom's survival MMO means that you don't have to lose your vehicle forever even if it goes down a sandworm's gullet. There's a catch, however. Thanks to the new \"vehicle recovery system\" added in Dune: Awakening patch 1.2.10.0, your vehicle backup tool now literally backs up your rides instead of just acting like a handheld garage. \"When vehicles that you personally own are removed from the world by the sandworm, coriolis storms, or complete destruction via combat they can now be recovered for a fee from a new Recovery mode in the Vehicle Backup Tool,\" says Funcom. You'll have to pay for this very important insurance, of course, and there's one other wrinkle in the bargain. \"In addition to a Solari fee, recovered vehicles will lose 15% of their maximum r…",
