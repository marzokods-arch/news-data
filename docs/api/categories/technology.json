That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6.

We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success. In a Steam post , Kira issued an update on the expansion's progress: \"I am still working on the DLC, it's about 70% done (I feel like it's been at 70% forever though). I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year. But in another Steam post published on Boxing Day, it said that this \"wound up being impossible\" as it was \"not possible to get every platform and global partner together in time\".

Over the last few years, The Witcher 3 mega-mod Brothers in Arms has restored hundreds of these cut lines (alongside other features like missing NPCs, restored books and journal entries). Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish.

U.S. commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that this deal will see Taiwan putting $250 ‌billion towards not only AI or semiconductor production, but energy as well (via Reuters ). This figure includes $100 billion from chipmaker TSMC, which it already committed to investing last year as part of a long term plan to build new fabs in the US . Both TSMC and the Taiwanese government have also committed to investing more in the future, with the country committing to guarantee an additional $250 billion in credit.

Vice Premier Cheng said, \"In this negotiation, we promoted two-way Taiwan–U.S. high-tech investment, hoping that in the future we can become close AI strategic partners.\" Reading between the lines of this optimistic statement, there's still plenty of uncertainty. For one thing, the deal …",

However, if they happen to use a specific Bluetooth pairing technology from Google, then there is a possibility that someone could remotely control the device, tap into the microphone, or even track its location. The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done). As reported by Wired , researchers at KU Leuven University in Belgium analysed a range of different audio devices and discovered that the Bluetooth protocols used were vulnerable to being remotely hacked. Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up. Worse still, if the device supports Google's Find Hub tracking network feature, the location could be monitored. As with all such vulnerabilities, there isn't just one hack, but a collection of techniques that can be …",

It's alright, I forgive you. I didn't complete the banquet either, but it's still surprising that out of the 12.4 million people who've bought Arc Raiders, only 1 million managed to serve the banquet, just 8.06%. Although this could be due to Candleberries being surprisingly hard to find in Arc Raiders, and not just because hardly anyone was interested in completing the task. (Image credit: Embark Studios) But there was more than just Candleberries to find out in the snow. During the Cold Snap, raiders could also enjoy snowball fights while slowly dying of hypothermia. 95 million snowballs were thrown over the course of the Cold Snap, with 10,577 arcs being taken down by one, and 91 raiders getting knocked out by them, a surprisingly low number if I'm being honest.

We often hear how many total quests are in a game— Skyrim has 273—but how much variety is there really? Fallout co-creator Tim Cain explains the nine core types of missions you can be given, and, to my surprise, kill and murder are two separate categories. If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

While the former is faster and more robust, the latter offers considerably more storage, making it ideal for housing terabyte-hungry games. And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",
