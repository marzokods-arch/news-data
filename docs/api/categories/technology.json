A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",

Now, it's targeting a mainstream audience in the indie action blockbuster DriveCrazy , a racing game in which you use a Kei Truck to outrun the apocalypse. The demo of DriveCrazy, which I took for a quick whirl, starts off with you participating in an annual Kei Truck rally. Even in this comparatively normal mode, things are pretty wild. Literally anything you do while driving earns you points. Drive cleanly? Points. Knock down a lamppost? Points! Smash through a hedge, spin your truck 360, and bin it off the road into a rice paddy? Points, points, points. No sooner have you completed the rally when oh no, aliens invade! Suddenly you're trying to outrun missiles and laser strikes while buildings collapse around you.
