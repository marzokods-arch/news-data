The cursed keebs in question are a line of wireless peripherals designed to give you an esports edge (via Videocardz ). How, you may be asking? By relegating key button presses to the domain of limbs you otherwise aren't using to game… is this what they call 'maximising efficiency'? So, picture this: rather than stretching your palms to reload or sprint, you could bind those commands to one of these under-the-desk peripherals instead. These cursed keebs come in three and four key versions, so the world's your oyster—or rather, foot pedal. Regardless of the button layout you go for, each 'key' is an ABS cap 25 mm in diameter, and features a Cherry MX Silent Black switch under the hood (or should that be 'under hoof'?). Each one requires an actuation force of at least 60 g, bottoming out at 85 g, meaning you're unlikely to accidentally press these by just resting your tootsies on top.

It's a formula that took a while to cotton on outside of Japan: it didn't really land as a big commercial success in the west until 2015's Yakuza 0. And that game landed loudly, despite making no overt compromises for western audiences. But now that western audiences are paying attention, will Ryu Ga Gotoku indulge them more?

In recent times, one of the tricks publisher Oxford University Press (OUP) has used to maintain interest is to make its \"word or phrase of the year\" a very internet-aware prize: in 2013 the winner was \"selfie\", in 2015 it went to the \"emoji tears of joy\", and in 2022 the gong went to \"goblin mode.\" These days the process involves a public vote (based on a shortlist produced by the OED), which informs the final decision made by its stern-faced lexicographers. \"Rage bait\" beat out \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" to scoop the title. The OED defines \"rage bait\" thusly: \"Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account.\" So essentially the manipulative tactics deployed online by many unscrupulous publishers in order to get you mad, get you clicking, and get yo…",

Asetek has been in a bit of a weird spot this year as a major watercooling patent expired in May , losing a key advantage it had in regards to liquid cooling. The day after the buyout announcement was made, Asetek's share price went up to 1.6 Danish Krone per share, almost doubling the value overnight. In the days following this announcement, share prices have stayed consistent.

OC3D claimed yesterday that the price hike will happen on the night of December 1, though we are unlikely to see the results of any such hike until the cost is pushed onto the buyer. The price change is reportedly at the distributor level, and therefore, down to those distributors to, well, distribute that price difference. With Cyber Week on , and deals still live, many sellers will be capitalising on that momentum to keep deals around for a little longer. It might not be until the sales fervour wears off that we see the impact of any increase, if one actually happens. Obviously, that's not guaranteed yet.

Don't ask me for specifics because, well, we don't have them. Only Embark does, and it's not telling. The only solace I can give you is that, in an update by community manager Lily on the Arc Raiders Discord server last week, it was confirmed that the \"skill point and stash space bonuses are permanent\". Additionally, they're based on your stash value and how much money you've got in your wallet at the time of departure.

    "body": "Elden Ring: Nightreign is a better game that I thought it would be, but that doesn't mean it can't get any better. This week's DLC drop is FromSoftware's chance to add a bunch of stuff nobody expected to show up in a co-op spinoff. Dark Souls has plenty of bosses to borrow from and the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is full of weapons that would transform how you approach each run. The beauty of Nightreign is the randomization of the items you find and the bosses you face, so even a slight update could change a lot. These are the things we'd like to see added (and not added) to the game to make the next 300 or so hours even more fun than before. Let me kick Libra to death (Image credit: FromSoftware) Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer : Playing as fist Raider in Deep of Night has really given me an appreciation for how every problem can be solved with punching, but we're still missing some of the best hand-to-hand weapons in Elden Ring. I was admittedly a bit disappointed when one of the new Nightfarers didn't turn out to be a Dryleaf martial artist, but FromSoftware could still add both Dryleaf Arts and Dane's Footwork as weapons, giving us a really distinctive moveset to ex…",

    "body": "It would be foolish to say that this is the final, incontrovertible proof that AI hype has gone too far. After all, just a week ago Microsoft's head of AI was clearly getting high on his own supply when he said that he just didn't get why folks don't like the idea of turning Windows into an \"agentic\" operating system. But Microsoft is now exhibiting 420BLAZEIT levels of AI hysteria by imagining that the logo for Copilot, a Windows 11 feature that nobody cares about or indeed likes, belongs on its 2025 ugly Christmas sweater. This year's sweater, dubbed \" Artifact ,\" follows the fuzzy XP hills , iconic Windows 3.0 logo, and successive sweaters featuring MS Paint, Minesweeper and Clippy. This year, Clippy returns as a prominent sweater feature, but he's joined by a hodgepodge of other Windows-related logos that frankly scream \"lazy clipart compilation.\" Which might actually be a perfect aesthetic for a nostalgic ugly Christmas sweater, what with the pixel art icons for MS-DOS, Paint, MSN and Internet Explorer. But then there's Copilot. Every other icon on the sweater dates back to the 1990s with the odd exception of the Minecraft Creeper, which already feels out of place. But what d…",
