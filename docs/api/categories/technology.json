But because there ain't no rest for a raider, Embark is gearing up to release Arc Raiders' first post-release map, that curious little place called \"Stella Montis\" that's been inaccessible but visible since the start. But it won't be as simple as logging in and checking out the new digs. Following in the style of Helldivers 2, Stella Montis can only be unlocked through a community event that kicks off with the update. Called \"Breaking New Grounds,\" the community quest challenges raiders who've \"who’ve battled through at least a few rounds\" to \"join forces to help Speranza rebuild the tunnels connecting to Stella Montis.\" Intriguing. The description of the quest sounds cooperative in nature, but how might that translate to raids on the surface?

So, if there was a way to get this process streamlined for me, I'd probably jump at the chance. This is why the creation of Steve, a mod that implements AI \"agents\" powered by systems like OpenAI and Gemini into the game, could be the best friend of players in need of an extra pair of hands. Created by YuvDwi and shared on GitHub, the Steve mod is pretty straightforward to understand. Essentially, it adds LLM-powered AI agents directly into Minecraft, which respond to your commands and play alongside you. This means you'll have a gaggle of Steves to boss around and ask to do tasks you simply cannot be bothered to do, or the ones you need some extra help with, like culling a bunch of sheep or mining for a specific resource. As stated in the mod's description, the agents \"aren't following predefined scripts\" either. Instead, they're \"operating off natural language instructions\", which allows you to basically talk to them as if you were playing with friends, minus the inevitable argument when someone is …",

Each augment of this level also has perks attached to it, such as the Tactical MK3 Healing augment that releases a cloud of healing smoke once revived from being down, and is on a 30-second cooldown.

These towering, spider-like monstrosities guard the Harvester and will rain mortar fire, laser beams, charges, and EMPs down on those brave (or stupid) enough to challenge them.

Microsoft had to make a carveout in its Bluetooth driver code for a specific mouse—its own Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000, released in 2006—because someone stuck a ® symbol in the name and caused the driver code to break. After I wrote that story, PC Gamer reader Bill (not Gates) emailed me with his own favorite bit of Windows lore and easily one-upped Microsoft mucking up its Bluetooth code. \"Windows XP and Win 7 'sounds' were edited and processed using a CRACKED version of Sonic Foundry Sound Forge ver. 4.5. You cannot make this up,\" he wrote. Well, maybe you could , but Bill didn't. This story actually goes back to 2004, when it was reported by German publication PC Welt. If you happen to have an old XP machine around, you can even find the files at WINDOWS\\Help\\Tours\\WindowsMediaPlayer\\Audio\\Wav. Here's the key bit from an archived version of the original article from PC Welt , when one of its editors looked at some of the .wav files that shipped with Windows: \"When you open one of these fi…",

That's excellent news for the folks who spent 1999 through 2005 jumping between numbered Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Fatal Frame games, long before all three series took breaks with spin-offs or went quiet. 2012 marks the last time Japan's horror trio released something more significant than a remaster within the same six months—the year Resident Evil 6, Silent Hill: Downpour, and the Wii-exclusive Fatal Frame 2 remake launched. Fatal Frame saw a couple of remasters in recent years, but those weren't quite as extensive as what Koei shared today. And yes, you read that correctly. This is the second remake of the second Fatal Frame, though folks in North America never had the chance to play the 2012 one.

In a follow-up post , Sweeney doubled down: \"This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines.\" I'm not sure that's accurate—my perception is that the divide isn't along political lines so much as it is between billionaires (like Sweeney) who tend to view generative AI as a way to crank out more content with less expense , …",

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, that's the cost of NAND, not the cost of an SSD. Phison buys NAND (flash) chips from suppliers—the three big ones being Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—and then uses them to make their own enterprise SSDs or to make SSDs for other customers. So, if the TLC flash that Phison is buying has risen from about $4.80 for one Tb (128 GB) in July to $10.70, as Pua claims, NAND has doubled in price, but this has yet to ripple into the SSD market. It will, though; that's unavoidable. SSD makers like Phison aren't going to shoulder 2x costs just 'cause. Eventually, SSD prices will have to rise. The primary cause for the rise in NAND prices is almost certainly undersupply caused by high demand for AI servers , which has now knocked on to SSD manufacturers like Phison. The …",

The perceived level of complexity that you're getting into can be challenging to overcome, but over the last decade more and more games in this vein have transformed from niche outliers to something more accessible. Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the biggest RPG surprises of recent years. The franchise rose from a twenty year slumber, and through the power of nuanced storytelling emerged from the CRPG weeds as the undisputed champion of the genre—and, in some ways, of all genres . But prior to that, at the time of The Witcher 3 's release, the natural comparison was, of course, Skyrim, which had recently redefined the open world RPG—full of experimentation, freedom, and floating cheese. Skyrim may have had some decidedly dark elements, but The Witcher 3 leaned into it hard—a potentially risky move at the time.

So it's good news, and perhaps vindication for those who were still holding out hope for Firefox, that it's expanding its fingerprint protections . By this, it means it's expanding its protections against websites linking you to a \"secret digital ID\" by \"collecting subtle details of your setup—ranging from your time zone to your operating system settings—that together create a 'fingerprint' identifiable across websites and across browser sessions.\" Fingerprinting is pretty much standard practice for many sites today. You should never assume that just because you don't have an official account on a website, it doesn't identify you between visits and so on, sometimes even regardless of stored cookies.
