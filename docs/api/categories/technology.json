The last roundup of announcements for 2025 coincides with the Warhammer World Championships, and has shown us stuff like new miniatures coming to Grand Cathay's army in Warhammer: The Old World . But we've also had an update on the latest chapter in the life of Demetrian Titus, protagonist of the bolterporn action games in the Space Marine series. After debuting as a captain of the Ultramarines in the first Space Marine, he was busted down to lieutenant for the sequel, and as we see in the trailer has now regained his former title. As of this promotion he's captain of the Second Company in place of Acheran, the guy in Space Marine 2 who constantly tells you he can only spare three men. Maybe that's why Acheran was demoted, although it's more likely he's dead or in a dreadnought. I'm sure we'll find out later. With that new rank comes a new responsibility. Roboute Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines , has tasked Titus with taking back the 500 Worlds—the Ultramarines' domain, which has been lost to various enemies like the tyranids and Word Bearers over the last 10,000 years.

Barring a delay, that would be the latest we can expect to see some form of substantial, presumably paid DLC for Nightreign.

It seems like Arc Raiders has successfully bridged the gap between the sickos and the rest of us, though, as not only is it the extraction shooter of choice for the chronically employed —it's one of the biggest games on Steam. According to SteamDB , the game is off to a screaming start, just hitting a peak concurrent player count of over 354,000 Friday night. That's a wild number for any shooter, especially given that the game only released a little over a week ago. It even briefly overtook Battlefield 6 , one of the biggest games on Steam in general right now , with BF6 settling in at around 318,000 players around midnight UTC Saturday morning and Arc Raiders sneaking past it with over 329,000. Arc Raiders can't match the long-running shooter's soaring highs, but it's drawn in a huge and consistent audience in its first week.

This week I've been: continuing to team up with players in Arc Raiders, and blasting the mean ones. As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

Sure, Helldivers 2 deserves its success, but Extermination's developer, Offworld, must be a little green watching Arrowhead's bug-blasting, fascist lampooning sci-fi action game gallivant off with all of the money. Hence, it would only be fair for Offworld to copy Arrowhead's homework a little, which appears to be the case for the cooperative spinoff's latest update. Update 1.8 will primarily introduce a Company progression system to Extermination when it arrives later in November. But I'm more intrigued by its tertiary feature—in-game airstrikes. Now, these work a little differently from Helldivers 2's airstrikes. Where Arrowhead's game lets you deploy them as a Stratagem, they form a side-mission in Extermination, something you can take on alongside the primary objective of building/defending your base. Specifically, players must defend new objectives called Fleet Relays out in the field, successfully doing which…",

I had just one problem: The sound in Arc Raiders would persistently hiccup and hitch, and the troubles would get worse the longer I played. After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix. A search through the Steam forums revealed that I was far from alone in struggling with this issue, which made me feel slightly better about things—misery and company, and all that.

Remasters tend to fall into two categories: gussied up classics that take advantage of technological improvements, new consoles and a new audience, or cynical attempts at double dipping. Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever. It largely feels as fresh as it did back in 2018. Yes, it launched during a previous console generation, but it's compatible with PS5 and Xbo…",

It's also a touch longer, a touch chonkier, and now comes with a substantial rounded ridge along the left side where the horizontal scroll wheel resides. The main buttons feel different, too, as they're now nestled inside a semi-translucent coating that strikes as one of the more bizarre additions I could think of adding to a mouse redesign.

Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems.
