It's got an Arc B390 iGPU that crushes all the others we've tested for gaming performance, and that's a remarkable technical achievement given the size of the graphics tile relative to the rest of the chip. But there's a significant caveat hanging over the Intel Arc B390, and it goes like this: it's very, very quick— for an iGPU. Sure, it's capable of delivering gaming laptop-like performance, but compare it to any discrete mobile GPU of the current generation and the little graphics tile's limits are quickly revealed. Now, none of this is meant to cast shade upon the considerable achievement of Intel's engineers. No one was expecting its new mobile graphics hardware to compete with, say, anything from the RTX 50-series. In fact, Intel claims the Core Ultra X9 388H is 10% faster at gaming (on average) than a lappy with an RTX 4050 mobile. And, if you squint closely at those claims, you'll see that they were made in reference to a 60 W gaming laptop, with '2x upscaling' enabled. (Image credit: Intel) Again, that's still fairly impressive for an iGPU, particularly as the Cor…",

That's primarily because it was too expensive for what it offers, especially compared to the first version. So consider me downright stupefied that Logitech seems to have raised its price, at least in the US. When I reviewed it, it was going for $100. Now it's going for $120 . To be fair, this is what happened with the original PowerPlay: it started off at $100 and was later raised to $120. But to be equally fair, I don't care, it's still far too expensive considering the downgrade from the first one. In case you don't have a clue what I'm on about, the G PowerPlay pads charge your compatible Logitech mouse—provided it has the charging puck in its underside—simply by resting the mouse on top of it. This means you never have to plug it in to charge ever again. The problem with the second version, though, is it cut back a lot of what made the first so good. In particular, the first one came with two pad toppers rather than one—one hard, one soft. And in even more particular, with the original you just had to plug in the pad in and it would not only charge your mouse but also act as the hub…",

On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache.

I don't think I could make up something more ridiculous than what's already been done. And yet, I am still impressed by Doombuds . Thanks to Sydney-based web developer Arin Sarkisian, Doom now runs on a pair of earbuds. More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM.

If you've played Risk of Rain 2, you'll know that it can be pretty tough, especially if you're heading into its alien wildernesses on your own. Such is the case with Lort. However, it seems some players are unhappy with the game's balancing, and their complaints are primarily why 28% of reviews are negative on Steam . On Friday, Big Distraction released an update to Lort making some adjustments to its challenge. But they also don't seem entirely happy about it. In a Steam post accompanying the update, Big Distraction addressed the issue of Lort's challenge. While it doesn't quite amount to \"git gud\", Big Distraction said that players shouldn't come to Lort expecting an easy ride. \"Lort is a roguelike and isn't meant to be a super easy game,\" the post reads. \"You are meant to die and learn how to overcome the challenge of each new level, enemy and boss.

A significant chunk of the appeal of them, just like The Elder Scrolls, is the option to flick back and forth between first-person and third-person at the press of a button. When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods. As Wombat explains, \"It covers all general movement animations when standing, which include idle, walking, running, jumping, and landing animations, all with directional variants.

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him.

The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens.
