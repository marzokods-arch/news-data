    "body": "Fishtank cases are everywhere. They must sell well, as every brand is scrambling to release more of the things, Corsair among them with its latest release: the Corsair Frame 4500X. Though some cases are more in the fishtank style than others, Corsair's latest is most definitely right there, with an unobstructed glass panel that transitions elegantly from the side to the front of the chassis. The Frame 4500X isn't about modesty. No fishtank case really is. You can't hide anything with a window quite this large onto your PC's components. It's a great way to showcase your build, however, and the Frame 4500X wears it well. I've shown a few people this case since building a PC into it for testing, and it quite literally has the wow factor (both people said 'wow' out loud—very satisfying). There's also a flowing design to the vents, sweeping from the rear of the top panel and down to the front of the side panel. This helps let the case and cooling solution breathe, but, very importantly, helps keep the non-windowed side of the case exciting and more of a match for the windowed side. You'll find the usual Corsair 'Y' pattern stamped into the metal frame elsewhere on the case—the rear exp…",

    "body": "It's no secret that the process behind the manufacturing of high-end processors is becoming ever more expensive with each advance in technology. The huge outlay in buildings and machinery, as well as years of research and development, runs into tens of billions of dollars. However, one report claims that TMSC plans to raise the price for its next-generation N2 process node so much that processors made on it will have to be a lot more expensive to cover the cost. That's according to China Times (via Dan Nystedt on X ), which claims that industry sources have told them that the price for TSMC's N2 process node will be more than 50% higher than N3. It notes that the Taiwanese firm's current best node, N3P, is around 20% higher than the previous generation N5. Price increases in semiconductor wafer manufacturing are inevitable, especially when it concerns the very best process nodes. That's because all of the equipment used to make the wafers has to be better than the apparatus used for earlier nodes. For example, Dutch company ASML develops and makes the photolithographic machines used in wafer making, and its latest and greatest system costs a cool $400 million per unit . While TSMC…",

That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power. As such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres. The two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.

Throw away the E-Liquid, though, we won't be needing it to slay imps, demons, and lost souls. Hacker and creator Aaron Christophel recently took to their YouTube channel to show Doom on a Pixo Aspire, which is \"a way overpowered vape, for whatever reason\" ( via VideoCardz ). It has a 32-bit Arm Cortex M4 processor, 384 kB of flash memory and up to 64 kB of SRAM. Christophel notes that it would need \"that last bit of RAM\" to run Doom natively, so this version is effectively sending game output to a bit of software, which flips the screen to run on the vape. In other words, a PC runs Doom but displays it on the vape's touchscreen via a USB Type-C cable. Christophel says you can \"use it as a second monitor\", which makes sense, should you have to show a mouse or some sort of small pet a duplicate of your screen. Hey, it's nice to have the option. If you have such a mouse, you can grab custom firmware via GitHub , run it on the vape, then mirror your screen. Impressively, this little vape has a Bluetooth LE chip and a microphone, too. I'm not to…",

Just recently, the UK's National Crime Agency reported on the arrest of London-based Thalha Jubair over the cyberattack on Transport for London's (TfL) online ticket system in 2024 . However, Jubair has also been charged by US authorities . \"[He] is alleged to have participated in a sweeping cyber extortion scheme carried out by a group known as Scattered Spider, which committed at least 120 attacks worldwide and resulted in over $115 million in ransom payments from victims,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R.

When it comes to phones, though, it's a tad more difficult, especially if the device in question is an iPhone 17 Pro Max. And when I say tad , I actually mean a hugely complicated feat of highly-skilled engineering, as one modder amply demonstrates. Apple's latest iPhone 17 Pro Max , the most expensive one in the released launched lineup, is available with four storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB. There's a $200 price tag difference between the first three, and because of the size of the capacity jump, a $400 gap between the 1 and 2 TB models. Unfortunately, there's no SD card slot or the like, so you can't change how much storage you have once you've bought one. Well, actually you can , though as DirectorFeng on YouTube shows, it's really not straightforward at all. With immaculate presentation and attention to detail, DirectorFeng's lengthy-but-lovely video takes you through every step involved in replacing the 256 GB SSD module in an iPhone 17 Pro Max with a 1 TB one (they had planned to use a 2 TB module but couldn't…",

However, two separate reports might provide the reason why the South Korean semiconductor firm's fortunes are suddenly looking a whole lot rosier. The first is from The Korea Economic Daily (via Bloomberg ), which claims that Samsung's HBM3E RAM chips have finally passed Nvidia's qualification tests for use in its AI mega-processors. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of RAM where multiple memory dies are stacked together to create a single module that can sustain a huge amount of data traffic per second. Samsung's most recent version of this tech, HBM3E , hadn't been meeting expectations , leaving competitor SK Hynix as the sole provider of the special memory for Nvidia. That no longer seems to be the case, though, given that its HBM3E has only just been approved, it will be some while before order books are full to bursting. Still, it's good news as far as the stock market is concerned, as Bloomberg points out that current prices are roughly 20% higher than expectations. What's certainly helping here i…",
