If that sentence has you feeling about 150 years old, just bear with me, because it's only going to get worse from here. Steal A Brainrot—a Roblox custom game where you hoard collectible meme characters in exchange for virtual currency, of which PC Gamer evergreen writer Kara Philips said \"sensory overload is a complete understatement\"—has filed a complaint against Stealing Brainrots, a Fortnite custom game which the Steal a Brainrot team at Spyder Games alleges is \"a copy.\" The suit states Stealing Brainrots \"copies [Steal A Brainrot's] protectable expressions,\" giving examples like \"user interface elements … in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics,\" and increasingly nebulous stuff like \"the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.\" It's worth noting that both games are specifically themed around Italian Brainrot, a specific wave of surreal AI-generated meme images that went around earning names like Chimpanzin…",

Thermaltake must have realised this because its latest AIO liquid CPU cooler has taken cooler screens to a new level, but it's also given it a whole bunch of neat extra features. The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case.

Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not a groundbreaking game by any stretch of the imagination, but that doesn't make it bad. If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise. The cycle continues. This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.
