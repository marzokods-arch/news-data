That's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you the names of some games with the punctuation removed, and you'll have to guess if they contain a colon, a dash, both, or neither. For simplicity's sake, I'm considering a hyphen a dash in this quiz (even though they're not the same thing), so if a game name has any kind of horizontal line in it, that counts! Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer. Think you can remember if a game's title contains a colon, a dash (or hyphen), both, or neither? Give it your best shot, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers. Not all of it…",

    "body": "Last year, the European Space Agency and a game developer got a little satellite, orbiting Earth in space, to run Doom in real-time . The lure of doing something perfectly normal on terra firma in the utterly hostile environment of space is just the preserve of a handful of coders, though, as two companies are hoping to be the first to have a data center and, believe it or not, a chip foundry in orbit. This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project. The reason behind it all is that if you have satellites in a synchronous low Earth orbit, they're exposed almost continuously to sun…",

In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price.

And while part of that's true, the recent spate of MMO news has me wondering if it's entirely our fault no new MMOs are coming out. Corporate wisdom (which is oftentimes an oxymoron) would have you believe that live services are the new moneymaker ( sure, if you hit it big , if you don't, you die) and that MMOs are unsustainable. To be fair to that wisdom, there are nuggets of truth in it. I don't mean to say that MMOs are a sure bet, far from it. MMOs are expensive, require constant maintenance, and competition is fierce because we don't like trying new stuff. But also, Amazon kinda messed New World up, and its shutdown is more about mismanagement than anything else. Contrary to hindsight, New World is not, on paper, a failed MMO.

Chinese PC specialist SixUnited has a couple of new Ryzen AI Max models listed on its website (via Videocardz ), and indeed, a SixUnited tablet running one of the \"new\" APUs has popped up in the PassMark database .

Currently, the only way to get a version of Strix Halo with all 40 RDNA 3.5c CUs is to go with the very top Ryzen AI Max+ 395 model. That's a very expensive APU and comes with fully 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, which is arguably overkill for mobile gaming, especially within the confines of a handheld.

    "body": "For 60 years, Gordon Moore's observation that transistor counts in integrated circuits would double roughly every two years has been spookily accurate. Ever-smaller transistors and ever-larger chips have made this possible, but with the physical limits of both impacting the growth of computing, new methods are required to continue the growth. One semiconductor research team claims to have achieved just that by stacking not chips or dies, but individual transistors. The work by the team at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia was published in Nature Electronics (via El País ), and as is always the case for such academic research, it's all very complicated. Basically, though, it comes down to the idea that chip makers are looking to go up , rather than using smaller transistors or wider dies, to keep Moore's 'law' alive. Processors such as AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D utilise hybrid bonding techniques to stack dies on top of each other, to increase the number of transistors in the whole package, so there's more cache. All SSDs today rely on multi-layer NAND flash memory to improve capacity, performance, and reliability. However, none of these methods f…",

Now, Bethesda would like you to know it's gearing up to break your mods once more, but at least it's a limited subset of them this time. With Fallout 4's 10th-anniversary edition gearing up for launch in the next week, the studio's warned players that it's going to break any main menu mods they might have come November 10, presumably because Todd Howard just gets a sick thrill from it. Or, well, possibly also because FO4's anniversary version will entail changes to the game's main menu, and so mods based on futzing about with the original version of that main menu will encounter stuff they don't anticipate in the new version and spark out like a robot fed a logic problem. Which is, you gotta admit, fair enough. I'd imagine the tweaks to the main menu relate to the \"new in-game Creations menu\" that Bethesda is adding to FO4, but that's not all that's coming.

Remember, these numbers are for the third quarter of 2025, alone. But from a PC Gaming perspective, the really good news is that the figures weren't all about selling AI chips to the likes of OpenAI. Sure, AMD's data centre revenue was up 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion, making it the largest single contributor. But combined client and gaming revenue increased even more, up 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. In other words, AMD is still pulling in almost as much cash from PC processors and graphics chips as it does from servers and AI clients. \"Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth,\" Su says.

A fightpad module was included too, so you could swap out either the left or right modules for some tactile six-button action. I'm describing this older model in such detail because this newer Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded (now labelled 'by Turtle Beach') is functionally identical to that older PC controller .

Each item, no matter how flashy or mundane, will have a description that tells you not only what it is and what it's used for, but also roughly where to find it. There are a few outliers with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, but for the most part, you know exactly what each item can do for you.

Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added.

There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers.
