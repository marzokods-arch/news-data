In an internal memo seen by RNZ , the retailer's New Zealand managing director, Shane Stockwell, told employees the decision was made after \"significant and repeated efforts to turn the business around\". EB Games Australia launched in 1997 as Electronics Boutique. Its first New Zealand outlet opened in Auckland in 2000, and in 2002, Electronics Boutique rebranded globally to EB Games. GameStop acquired the company in 2005 for $1.44 billion, and it's been owned by the Texas-based corporation ever since. In addition to the closure of 38 retail outlets, the New Zealand distribution centre will close on February 28. In a note on the EB Games website it's confirmed that access to ebgames.com.au will open to New Zealand customers \"by the end of March 2026\". It's unclear how many jobs have been affected. According to Stockwell's internal memo, the company had received proposals from third parties following early reports of the closure. In the end, \"these parties did not present any proposals or solutions about how to keep the New Zealand business…",

With plenty of room for storage, fans, and a disk drive in its dual-chamber design, the Air 540 was a great pick for my own PC back in 2014. Though I've since moved on, and that case has been stuck in storage for years. Now, finally— finally— we have a true successor in the Corsair Air 5400. The Air 5400 isn't just a rerun of old ideas. It's still a stocky cuboid, but where the Air 540 championed a dual-chamber design that has become the norm for PC cases, the Air 5400 offers a triple-chamber design. Think of it like three distinct zones: there's the main one, for showing off your build; the rear one, with plenty of room for cable management; and a third one, for mounting an all-in-one liquid cooler's radiator inside. The idea behind the third chamber is pretty simple. By mounting the radiator away from other components, and with ample airflow, hot air generated by the CPU can be efficiently expelled from the case and not warm anything around it. It also removes the need for the radiator to block precious fan mounting locations. It's a slick solution. The radiator is mounted toward the front of the…",

To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing.

It's surprisingly bold, then, that upcoming game Talystro turns that entirely on its head. On this little mouse's quest, the goal is instead to make specific numbers. Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

This is effectively a bestiary, taking note of every mob you stumble across as you explore, whether they're a peaceful farm animal or a disgusting floating eyeball. However, you won't have access to Memories immediately. You've no doubt seen the prompt in the inventory screen to 'find the Forgotten Temple'—yeah, that's for the Memories. Since it's a progression system based on exploration, I recommend you unlock it as soon as you can, so here's what you need to do. How to unlock Memories at the Forgotten Temple in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) First you have to unlock the Memory system, which requires you to find the Forgotten Temple. There are multiple dotted around the map, but in my experience, there should be a Forgotten Temple near where you first spawn, which will be marked on your map with a portal icon. Head inside the building and take the stairs down behind the altar, where you'll find an earthen golem guarding a portal. The golem is easy enough to kill with copper weapons and armour, but if you don't have them, you can ac…",

Unfortunately, the certificates it relies on to carry out this task are expiring in June this year, which has kicked Microsoft into action to start issuing replacements to PCs in need of them via Windows updates. The latest security update, KB5074109 , will start a process of checking whether a PC is using the expiring Secure Boot certificates (2011 CA) and provide the newer certificates (2023 CA) if so. As Microsoft notes, many existing PCs have these newer certificates already. The CA 2011 certificates are the original Secure Boot certificates and Microsoft recommends OEMs ship the newer CA 2023 certificates with Windows 11 25H2 devices to prevent issues when the older certificates expire. However, there may still be some machines without the latest certificates, and come June, Secure Boot can no longer be trusted to verify firmware modules if that's still the case. \"Many Windows PCs manufactured since 2024 already have the updated 2023 certificates\" Microsoft says in a blog post . \"For the remaining devices, Microsoft is delivering…",

When the company increased prices for laptop memory late last year , it managed not to crank up Desktop and Mainboard prices. But no longer. In an updated blog post , Framework says that memory prices from its suppliers \"continue to increase rapidly\". Apparently, 128 Gbit chips have been hit hardest by the price spikes. And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.
