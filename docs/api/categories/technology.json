My favourite weapon so far, though, has to be the Stitcher; it's a breeze to use against other players. Until now, it's largely been a 'vibe' thing for me. Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot. This demolishes the Rattler IV's average 11,900 damage per gun at 3.9 credits per shot. There's a noticeab…",

At least, that was the case, but now some absolute legend has made a tool that should make things a lot easier. The web-based tool, MoboMaps by Robin Wilde , does what I think most people who have been in the gaming PC building bizz for a while will recognise as a giant service to humanity. It shows you visually and interactively exactly where different motherboards have different PCIe lanes routed. Apart from how many VRMs it has and how many I/O ports it has, probably the most important thing to consider with a motherboard is how many PCIe lanes it has routed to different areas. This is particularly important when you expect to use multiple storage devices or expansion cards. PCIe lanes are what your different components use to communicate with each other—they're physical, embedded routes that run through your motherboard.

    "body": "According to a new report on Korean outlet Dailian , Samsung has announced early results from mass production of its next-gen 2 nm chip node. But the company is only making very modest claims versus its existing 3 nm silicon. Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

Lynch claims the Android version will be available as an alternate branch of the Steam game's app ID, hence the two-for-one, no need for a separate purchase theory. He also theorises, \"If you own this game on Steam already, you will have access to the Android version on Steam Frame day one.\" This would be a very good thing for the upcoming Steam Frame .

When asked whether he'd like to say anything about the most recent Linux Kernel release, 6.18 RC4 , Torvalds seemed reluctant to espouse on the virtues of the update: \"No, so that's the current kernel version. I like boring, and boring to me is no super exciting new features that will break machines for millions of people around the world.\" \"6.18 does not seem to [have] problems. But we had a rash of test failures, and it turned out they were… actually failures of the tests, not of the kernel,\" Torvalds continued. \"So I was a bit worried a couple of weeks ago, but it seems to be shaping up to be another incremental, and boring in the best possible way, release.\" Certainly, there's a lot to be said for boring. And while Torvalds has been openly critical of other tech industry giants over the years, it's difficult not to look at these comments and think he might be gently referencing some of the missteps ma…",

Now, as we've detailed on multiple occasions , FSR 4 Redstone is AMD's latest AI-enhanced upscaling platform. Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology can therefore be \"converted\" into compute shader code.…",

Said rodent sits on your shoulder and speaks gnomically in a voice that sounds like someone unrolling an ancient, cursed papyrus scroll, and I already love him and want him to be my very best friend. The rat appears right at the start of the trailer, seemingly complaining to the player character about having narrowly escaped an ambush. There's a bit of rhetorical back-and-forth between the two, before the player commands the rat to return to the safety of his knapsack, as the pair move on in search of their destination—the Moon Gate. The rest of the trailer shows off a mixture of combat and exploration.

Yes, I had to look it up.

While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only .

Even then, you'll only get an XP boost once a day from these actions, and waiting until the next day when you want to head to the next area can feel like waiting a lifetime. When you hit level 2 with your horses, you can also assign skills to each pony like mining rocks, digging holes, and harvesting or watering crops which does give you another avenue for XP farming. But, as much as I love how efficient it is to mine resources and farm now you don't have to deplete your own stamina, it's by no means a fast process. Luckily, outside of gift giving and quality time, you can also work on your bond by riding them around and jumping over obstacles, but this process is still pretty arduous.

    "body": "Completing A Symbol of Unification might be one of the most rewarding quests in Arc Raiders , relative to how much time it actually takes. The entire mission consists of two small tasks: finding a flag in a Raider outpost, and hoisting said flag above said outpost. Doing this gets you the Aviator outfit (that one with the headphones), so it's well worth the time. In this quest, Celeste asks you to head to the Formicai Outpost on Dam Battlegrounds to do your flag waving. Finding the flag is pretty straightforward, but you might be struggling with where to hoist it. Either way, I'll run through the whole A Symbol of Unification quest below. Since you're not extracting anything, it might be worth bringing a free loadout , especially as the trek to Formicai can be quite long if you get an inconvenient spawn. Locate the flag at the Formicai Outpost Formicai Outpost is in the south of Dam Battlegrounds on the hill (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, head to Formicai Outpost in the south of Dam Battlegrounds, on the rocky mound to the south, above the Scrap Yard. The easiest way to get inside is to follow the trail up the hill that leads around to its southern end , where you'll fi…",

Now Cloudflare has posted a full explanation of the outage and it turns out the problem was entirely internal and self inflicted. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince's mea culpa was remarkably unambiguous. Up front and literally in bold, he kicks off with the following statement: \"The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack or malicious activity of any kind.\" He follows that up with an entirely caveat-free apology. \"We are sorry for the impact to our customers and to the Internet in general. Given Cloudflare's importance in the Internet ecosystem any outage of any of our systems is unacceptable. That there was a period of time where our network was not able to route traffic is deeply painful to every member of our team. We know we let you down today.\" So, what, exactly, happened?

Eyponomously named the Alice Recoque, after the French computer scientist who passed away in 2021, the supercomputer is a collaboration between AMD and Eviden . Europe's second supercomputer to date, the Alice Recoque will be built with next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs, codenamed \"Venice,\" and AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs. The latter of these is part of the MI400 series of accelerators that is geared towards AI computing for scientific research specifically. Eviden then covers networking, connecting AMD's components via its BullSequana XH3500 platform. The whole thing is being touted as an 'AI factory'. The hope is that all of this cutting-edge tech will mean France's first supercomputer will be capable of delivering \"more than one exaflop of HPL performance\" upon completion. HPL here refers to 'High-Performance Linpack', which is a type of benchmark to test serious processing power, such as what the Alice Recoque will eventually possess. According to AMD's own definition of HPL , this benchmark specifically involves solving \"a (random) dense linear system in double precision (64 bits) arithmetic on distribu…",

You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype.
