    "body": "I don't know when the first argument about a videogame was had, but something tells me it was before the first videogame was finished. Still, things seem to have gotten much worse in recent years, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Friday to discuss the issue of \"arguing about games\" at length . \"People have always had different tastes and they wanted different things,\" Cain said in the video. \"I think each one of you, individually, knows what you want. Where things break down is, you don't seem to realize or recognize that there's a lot of other people out there and they all want different things. And this isn't just gamers, developers do this too.\" Cain acknowledged there's no right way to make a game; disagreements over how to properly optimize a game, what features do and don't belong, and so on all come up during the dev cycle and years after a game has released. An example he gives in the video is RPG romance. Whether you loved or hated how horny Baldur's Gate 3 was, it's clear that romanceable party companions are as popular as they are polarizing—and Cain said he's been pressured to include them even though they aren't to his taste. He also pointed…",

But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess. As was prophesied, Larian kicked off its Q&A —with Vincke and a load of other studio honchos—earlier today. One key takeaway? Larian's swearing off using gen AI tools in concept art development. \"First off—there is not going to be any gen AI art in Divinity,\" wrote Vincke. \"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by…",

Which makes it a great pity that they're not available for older generations of AMD GPUs, like RDNA 3. The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results. So why won't AMD give that effort some official support? Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience. But when asked if there could be \"an opportunity to make a beta version of Redstone that will run on RDNA 3,\" his answer is at least a little promising. \"That's currently not in the plan, but thanks for the hint.

The company's presentation was primarily focused on AI and robotics, but it logged a mere 120 mentions of AI during its 91 minute runtime. That's only 1.3 mentions of AI per minute (AI/min). AMD's CES keynote , led by Dr. Lisa Su, hit a staggering 210 mentions of AI. That was over a longer runtime of 117 minutes, though it works out to a much higher 1.8 AI/min. Su really wanted to drive that point home, huh? Now, bear in mind that some Ryzen products have AI in the name. Ryzen AI Max, for example, though only 13 mentions of AI in AMD's show were preceded by the word 'Ryzen'.

Now Videocardz claims the chip will be branded \"Intel Core G3 Extreme\" and have the same iGPU as Panther Lake in laptops. That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut. The full-spec Panther Lake configuration in the aforementioned Core Ultra X9 388H has four Performance cores, eight Efficient cores and four Low Power Efficient cores. …",
