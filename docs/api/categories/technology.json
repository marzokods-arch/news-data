    "body": "In a recent interview with IGN , Keanu Reeves offered a spark of hope that he may return as foul-mouthed rockerboy Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2, the currently in preproduction follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077. This is far from a confirmation, though, and the original game's many ending permutations complicate the character's potential return. Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see. More likely would be an app…",

Acutis was canonised in an ancient ritual led by Pope Leo, who himself has a good shout to be the first gaming Pope . The teenager's path to sainthood has been remarkably short: the campaign to have him canonised began six years after his death in 2012; he was decreed \"Venerable\" in 2018, \"Blessed\" in 2020, and now the Pope has formally declared Acutis a saint in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. Born in London, Acutis was still a baby when his Italian parents returned home, and he would spend the rest of his life in Milan. Acutis' family recalls him enjoying videogames including, of course, Halo, as well as the likes of Mario and Pokémon. He got a PlayStation when he was eight but, as a true servant of the Lord, restricted himself to one hour of play a day. It should also be said that Acutis was clearly a remarkable child.

We're building and testing every PC we highlight, and if we run into any issues, we'll explain them here. We're back with another build. This time, a compact white gaming PC, powered by AMD's top gaming CPU, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and a Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC Ice SFF .

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like. Boo. Still, ETnews reports that Nvidia has told Samsung to double up its GDDR7 production—according to its industry sources—and that the Korean DRAM manufacturer has duly responded.

If you've been paying attention to the discourse—I wouldn't blame you for not doing so—around Silksong , you'll have heard that it's hard , and also kind of cruel. And while I personally wonder if the person who put that one bench in the Hunter's March is doing okay and maybe needs to hash some things out with a therapist, I, a certified soulslike freak, am here to tell you that you aren't wrong. Silksong is hard, thorny, and vicious. It's got that classic Dark Souls bite to it: Optional areas that'll stomp you flat, punishing upgrade systems you'll be too poor for if you die a lot, and that one jackass Savage Beastfly whose hurtbox is big enough to have its own postcode. But I'm also here to tell you to stick with it. Having just gotten to Act 2 (I won't be going into spoilers), a lot of those initial problems with the game have basically melted away.
