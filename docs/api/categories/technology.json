News of the deal caused Oracle's share price to surge by as much as 43% on Wednesday, increasing CEO Larry Ellison's wealth by an estimated $100 billion—and briefly knocking Elon Musk off the top spot as the world's richest person. For which we all played our tiny violins, I'm sure. Anyway, Oracle's share price dipped slightly by the end of the day, putting Musk back at the top once more. I'm not sure what happens when you receive the title back—I like to think trumpets herald a messenger carrying your new, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted plaque—but regardless, Musk has reclaimed the position, despite a year where his Tesla-enhanced fortunes have experienced the odd wobble or two . The Oracle/OpenAI deal is said to be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, which is quite an impressive feat given just how much money is being funneled into AI computing in the metaphorical skies. The contract is said to begin in 2027, and looks to represent something of a risk for both companies, given OpenAI's massive operating…",

Indeed, Microsoft has confirmed that it won't actually bring any unique features at all . Any features that roll out to 25H2 will also be available for the current 24H2 build of Windows. However, there is at least one upside to that. 25H2 is built on what Microsoft calls the Windows shared servicing branch. That means that it can be installed via the normal Windows Update latest cumulative updates (LCUs). So, it can be downloaded and installed in the background with its various component parts disabled, until the entirely of 25H2 has been acquired. At that point, all it takes is a simple reboot to enable the full update. However, you can also download the full 7 GB install ISO if that's how you prefer to roll.

As a gamer, I'm used to seeing flashy chairs from the usual suspects, but this was something different enough to grab my attention. And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe. The back support bar looks like it belongs in a spaceship cockpit, and the seat cushion is plush but breathable—think memory foam with a…",

    "body": "Apple's new A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 was announced yesterday and the first Geekbench scores have been uploaded. To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench. The bottom line here is that Apple has long had a clear IPC or single-core and per-clock-cycle p…",

Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397 , a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance.
