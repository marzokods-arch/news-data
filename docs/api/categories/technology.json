    "body": "The games industry's biggest fire sale continues, as Embracer Group has sold Star Trek Online developer Cryptic Studio and publisher Arc Games, which also handled publishing duties for games like Remnant 2 , Torchlight , and the recently released old-school MMO Fellowship . The buyer is Project Golden Arc, which is owned and led by members of Arc Games' management. The deal—which is worth $30 million, has been financed by XD Inc, perhaps best known as the developer and publisher of the free-to-play Torchlight Infinite . Embracer will retain the publishing rights to the popular, Soulslike-infused shooters Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant 2. These will be transferred to THQ Nordic, which already owns the IP rights and Remnant's developer Gunfire Games. The rights to Fellowship are also being transferred, but these will be handed over to Satisfactory developer and publisher Coffee Stain, which will be spun off from Embracer to become a publicly traded company on December 11. \"This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow,\" Embracer CEO Phil Rogers said in a state…",

    "body": "When Battlefield 6 launched a month and a half ago, one of its most anticipated features basically didn't work. The Portal server browser was a dumpster fire at first, hosting dozens upon dozens of lazy XP farms that clogged up EA's servers so bad you couldn't even start your own friend lobby. Then, DICE nerfed XP farms into the ground. Folks complained, some who apparently only bought BF6 to shoot at bots demanded refunds, and many XP farming servers were taken offline. Now weeks later, I decided to check in on the BF6's Portal tab, hoping to find folks using Portal the way I hoped they would from the start: creating neat custom games and hosting specialized servers. I'm pleased to report both are happening, but not in huge amounts. First, the good news: Legitimately fun custom games are starting to pop up, several of which resemble the sort of goofy stuff you'd find perusing the custom lobbies of Halo or Garry's Mod. The most popular one of the moment is Chaos Climb by Forstorare (Portal code: zx45f) . Instead of describing it, I'd rather show you what it's all about: To me, this is videogames. What I dig about Chaos Climb is how it flexes the one big thing that Portal has that …",

And not for the first time: He shared similar sentiments (and credit for Gustave) back in June , not long after Clair Obscur came out. It should make Charlie very happy, then, that Cazorla is getting credit for his effort: Not from the awards shows, which unfortunately don't generally pay much attention to mocap work, but from the internet at large. \"Thank you for all the messages these past few days,\" Cazorla wrote on X (via GamesRadar ) shortly after Cox's comments came to light. \"Charlie’s words were incredibly generous, and I’m truly grateful. Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I’m honored to have played my part in it.

    "body": "Electronic Arts announced last week that a free trial for Battlefield 6 , \"the best selling shooter of 2025\" (a bold claim given that it's still ongoing), would get underway on November 25 . Well, today is November 25, and yeah, you can probably see where I'm going with this. The Battlefield 6 free trial is live! One thing interesting (and, I think, new) about the Battlefield 6 free trial is that you don't access it through Battlefield 6, as you might expect; if you hop around to the BF6 Steam page , you'll see there's no sort of \"try me free!\" option available. Instead, you get to it through Battlefield Redsec , the battle royale mode, which is always free to play. But during the trial period, you'll also have access to three playlists, including a \"casual multiplayer experience,\" across three maps: Siege of Cairo, Eastwood, and Blackwell Fields.\" In a nice nod to newcomers, EA also provided a handy breakdown of each game mode available in the trial, as well as some tips on how to play them effectively . So if you don't know what Escalation is, for instance, or how to play it in a way that will actually be useful to your team, this is a way to get a sense of the basics without ge…",

At least not yet. Eleventh Hour Games broke its silence on whether you'll have to pay for Last Epoch's upcoming Orobyss expansion after spending years—as an indie developer—promising players everything would be free. The answer is no: Last Epoch's expansion will be free to anyone who already owns the base game, and it will be packed in for anyone who buys the game after it's out. Last month, EHG founder Judd Cobler said the studio would \"maybe\" have to charge something for the expansion, as the game's first three seasons haven't been profitable. But now it looks like EHG will hold to the promise it made when it ran a Kickstarter for the game in 2018. There's a small catch here though: Alongside the expansion a new \"Paradox class\" will be released and it will have a price that won't be revealed until later. In the announcement post on Reddit, Cobler describes it as a \"fully alternate playable class built on systems that work differently from anything else in the game.\" T…",

Naomi Alderman is a published author of science fiction novels. And for years she's also been the lead writer for a gamified fitness app called Zombies, Run! It encourages players to get on the move by listening to episodic post-apocalyptic stories, interval training while actively 'running from zombies,' and supplies rewards from workout sessions to upgrade their survival base. Alderman co-created the app and wrote its years' worth of voice-acted, episodic stories that have amassed over 10 million users since 2012.

The description on the How to Fish Steam listing doesn't do it justice: \"You and your friends are out drinking and boating. You crash into a small island where you have to fish using everything from fishing rods to assault rifles,\" it explains. \"Sell your catch, earn money, buy better fishing gear, and defeat boss fishes to unlock new islands and finally make it back home.\" We've been living in a post- Ridiculous Fishing world of absurdist angling for years.

Now? Well, kind of the same thing again. As captured by the good folk at Posta Entretenimiento , Cox was recently asked how he felt about his Game Awards nomination for best performance, and almost immediately disavowed 95% of the credit. \"I'm thrilled for this nomination,\" said Cox. \"I've said this before, and I think it's important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role, in that game.\" What bearing does that have on Cox's TGA nom? \"So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him.\" Which is really quite charming, and in an industry where so much vital mocap work ends up becoming kind of invisible—we all know Geralt's voice actor Doug Cockle, but far fewer of us could name Maciej Kwiatkowski, who does his mocap—it's definitely an important point to make.

Pour one out, then, for the Google employees who attended an all-hands meeting earlier this month, only to be told that they need to double its serving capacity every six months to meet AI compute demand. That's according to CNBC , as the news outlet got a look at a presentation reportedly given to employees by Google AI infrastructure chief Amin Vahdat earlier this month. A slide entitled \"AI compute demand\" informed the team that \"Now we must double every six months... the next 1000x in 4-5 years.\" CNBC also reports some direct quotes from the meeting, which was also said to be attended by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai . While Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have been pouring huge sums of money into data center expansion in recent months to boost their own AI serving capabilities, it appears that Google's lofty expansion goals might not be receiving the same budget. Vahdat reportedly told employees that \"[Google's] job is of course to build this infrastructure, but it's not going to outspend the competition, necessarily\" and that the real goal will be providing infrastructure …",

If I'm playing with a buddy and I go down first, yes, I want a front row seat to the shootout, so I'll crawl around for the best view and start doing doughnuts to distract the enemy. Surely this could have no downsides whatsoever…is what I thought until today. After seeing side-by-side testing by creator Jinko, I now realise I've been doing it wrong this whole time, and I'm riddled with the mental anguish of knowing I didn't need to bleed out on a few occasions. It turns out that your down timer decays faster when you're moving compared to staying stationary, and it's quite a drastic difference. It's hard to gauge specifics from the video, but you can cling to life for at least a good few seconds more if you sit your ass down.

You know what else scores 4310 points in that test? Nothing. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D ? 3332. The Core i9 14900KS? 3238. The Core Ultra 9 285K ? 3214. When Apple claimed the ARM-based M5 had the best single-core performance in the world, it sure meant it. But can it game? While you used to be able to buy desktop Macs with Radeon cards in them, we haven't seen that for a while, and no M-series processor has yet been paired with any kind of discrete GPU. Apple instead relies on the integrated graphics cores and, for more powerful desktop machines, its ability to literally glue multiple chips together to increase their number, brute-forcing a solution to the problem by throwing more silicon at it. I tried it out already with an extraordinarily expensive Mac Studio containing a 16-core M4 Max CPU with a 40-core GPU, but what I'm attempting t…",

As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them.

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession . Despite the fancy concept of studying your opponent's words and picking the correct comeback cards to win, Gift of the Gab is really a stat-based minigame—which means it's only winnable once you have access to stat boosts, card upgrades, and craftable talismans as part of the Scholar skill tree.
