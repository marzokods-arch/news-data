    "body": "'Integrity' has been a very big word in the RuneScape sphere this past year—Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy used the word at least six times when justifying some of his bolder decisions in 2025 . Among those were his declaration that Jagex would take a sledgehammer to the microtransactions that have \"tainted\" RuneScape 3 , which sounds cool, and his decision to nix RuneScape's in-game Pride events , which sounds bad. Players were given the opportunity to vote in November as to whether they'd like the widely reviled Treasure Hunter microtransactions removed: Obviously, they said yes , and that's one of the first items on the 2026 roadmap unveiled today. The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game. Players will have the year to use up whatever items they've already bought, \"with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before [hundreds of gameplay-impacting MTX] items are ultimately made obsolete.\" Plenty more was shown off with the new roadmap. …",

Micron's vice president, Dinesh Bahal, set the table as clear as it could have possibly been when discussing the AI industry's rampant consumption of memory. \"This thing called high bandwidth memory.

As reported by Bloomberg , Howard Lutnick (above, second right) pointed out that the possibility of import levies, already addressed in a trade accord with Taiwan , also applies to South Korean firms. \"Everyone who wants to build memory has two choices: They can pay a 100% tariff, or they can build in America. That’s industrial policy.” The DRAM and NAND flash industry is dominated by three companies : Samsung and SK hynix in South Korea, and Micron in the US. There are other memory makers, more so in the flash sector than pure DRAM, but even grouped together, they have nowhere near the same market share as any of the big three.

In addition to a new version of the old PS3 game it'll come with Dark Ties which, as Wes Fenlon discovered last week, is a \" breakneck roguelite dungeon crawl \" set during the same time period. That's good news for people who love shiny new things, but it's bad news for those who love old things, because when Kiwami 3 releases the remastered version of Yakuza 3 will be harder to buy. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio confirmed as much on Saturday. \"Those who already own Yakuza 3 Remastered will still be able to continue playing it,\" the company posted on X , but \"for those new to the series who wish to experience the original version, it will be available with purchase of the Yakuza Complete Series bundle.\" The Yakuza Complete Series bundle is $130 on Steam when it's not on sale, and it's a pretty good deal if you want, oh, probably around 500 hours worth of Yakuza games. If you want to buy Yakuza 3 Remastered separately it'll set you back $20, though both the bundle and the standalone Yakuza 3 go on sale pretty damn regularly: the latter often goes for around $6. The contents of the bundle has changed over the years thanks…",

It's a risky move for such a high-profile game to skip all the pre-release marketing hype entirely, but it paid off, and it's clear why Respawn went that route—\"photoreal PvP hero shooter\" was an eyeroll-inducing prospect even back in 2019, so letting the game speak for itself short-circuited any pre-release angst. We don't know if the strategy could have been replicated, but would it have been worse than the late Concord's legendary failure or the reaction to the recently announced Highguard, which was the final big reveal at last year's Game Awards ? Viewers expecting something like 2023's Monster Hunter Wilds reveal or the one-two Matrix Unreal Engine 5 tech demo and Matrix 4 trailer in 2021 have been taking out their frustrations on Highguard. The reveal was drowned out by hot takes calling out its \"Concord vibes\" and it received a ghastly 2,400 dislikes on YouTube compared to around 500 likes when it first dropped. There's been an assumption to some of the criticism that Highguard wanted this smoke, so to speak—an idea that if the Highguard studio hadn't splurged on such an exclusive spot, it wouldn't have earned all this ire.

If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success. In a Steam post , Kira issued an update on the expansion's progress: \"I am still working on the DLC, it's about 70% done (I feel like it's been at 70% forever though). I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

Back in August, Re-Logic revealed that it was \"in the endgame\" of development for the update, having defined an internal launch window that it confirmed with various partners. Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year.
