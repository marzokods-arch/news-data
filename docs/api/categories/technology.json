In an interview for a gaming-focused exhibit at Melbourne's ACMI museum spotted by Dexerto , Team Cherry honchos Ari Gibson and William Pellen talked about their perspective on difficulty with an admission that yeah, Silksong's hard, but that's more or less the point. \"Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight—so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent,\" Gibson said. \"[Players] have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled.\" Indeed, Gibson said that while \"some moments of steep difficulty\" may be frustrating, if it…",

Oh, and there's the minor matter of Nvidia investing $5 billion in Intel. But what will these unholy Intel-Nvidia chips look like? For now, there are virtually no official details, though we might get more this evening in the dual-CEO presser with Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang . But there's an existing chip that might just give some very important hints of what to expect. I speak of the so-called GB10 \"Superchip\" . GB10 is also a collaboration between Nvidia and another chip maker, though in this particular case, it's Mediatek and an Arm rather than an x86 CPU. However, it sports several details that immediately ring a bell in the context of the announced Intel-Nvidia deal. In today's press release , there was a broad reference to Nvidia's high-bandwidth, low-latency NvLink interface being a critical part of the technological tie-up.

Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.
