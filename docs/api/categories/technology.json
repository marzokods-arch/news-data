So how the heck did I miss that there was a whole new live action Witcher movie. On Netflix. Starring Dolph Lundgren. And it came out in October of this year. It wasn't just me: a bunch of us at PC Gamer, movie fans and Witcher fans alike, missed it too. It's called The Rats: A Witcher Tale , a feature-length special that serves as a prequel to Season 4, and you can watch it right now on Netflix—though judging from evidence I'm about to present, I'm not sure Netflix really wants you to. Exhibit A: Netflix didn't do a heck of a lot to tell people about this movie. I get mail from Netflix in both my professional and personal inboxes, and they sent nothing about this special. Zilch. I also have an account on a Netflix press site that has absolutely zero mention of it. Odd. Weirder still, I searched the official YouTube channel and there's no trailer or even a teaser for it.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . Very rarely do I have the time or energy to play a new game more than once. Replays are usually something born from necessity, like work-related tasks, or my insatiable nostalgia for old RPGs. Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it. To be clear, that's two more times than I was asked to play for our South of Midnight review . I went at it a second time at my own leisure, then followed up again with a third replay so a friend could watch me, but I'll be damned if I didn't find some easy-to-miss, tiny detail with every press of 'new game' that made me fall in love with Hazel's journey through the American South all over again.

You don't need me to muster every bit of evidence I can find, because even if you don't remember each step in the bleak parade you can recall the shape of the march. Or maybe that's just the end-of-year fugue trying to convince me it's already past time I surrendered to the sugar coma and don't have to do any more work. Who can say? Either way, when you chalk up this many Ls in a single year, I don't think the passing shame of a single week's news cycle can do the whole picture justice.

The find was made by a new YouTube channel called Games' Past, and is two gigabytes larger than the release version of New Vegas and filled with cut or altered content that the team has been slowly teasing out. Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory. In the release version of Old World Blues there's a VR room that has been wrecked, and has no functionality. Here it works. Kinda.

Windows treats most drives as SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), which has been used for decades now and largely intended for hard drives. As such, NVMe drives that offer higher parallel performance than a hard drive are somewhat limited by the SCSI conversion: taking NVMe commands from an NVMe SSD and changing them to SCSI for the benefit of the OS, which introduces processing overhead and latency. You can see this for yourself by going into your PC's device manager -> Standard NVM Express Controller -> properties -> details -> class. It will be described as 'SCSIAdapter'. But Microsoft just announced that native NVMe support is now available in Windows Server 2025 ; essentially circumventing the entire conversion process and speeding things along. \"Switch onto Native NVMe as soon as possible or you are leaving performance gains on the table!\" Microsoft says in the announcement blog post. \"With Native NVMe in Windows Server 2025, the storage stack is purpose-built for modern hardware—eliminating translation layers and legacy constraints.\" (…",

The settlement put an end to a two-and-a-half year-long saga which as recently reported by Game File , took some wild twists and turns as it wended its way through court. At various stages, the suit witnessed accusations of demonic possession, lawyers throwing down Lil Wayne lyrics, and Aspyr desperately trying to conceal what it believes to be vital trade secrets. The lawsuit kicked off in late summer 2023, with gamer Malachi Mickelonis suing Aspyr for alleged consumer fraud after feeling \"completely duped\" the company, who had released KOTOR 2 on Switch in 2022. In a YouTube trailer for the port, Asypr had briefly noted that a DLC built using the Restored Content Mod would be coming to Switch in Q3 that year.

The front support foot is slightly taller than the back one, giving it a lean of, if a fun 10 minutes spent with a spirit level and a child's protractor have produced correct results, about 10 degrees. This means you can still rest your coffee mug on the top, as long as it's not too full, but also that, if you're buying this smaller-than-average tower PC with the intention of it flitting flush with a piece of furniture, it won't. This may or may not be a problem, depending on how picky you are about these things, but the Predator logo that sticks off the front and looks rather like someone melded a Space Invader with a Decepticon means you might want to push it back a little further. Despite its drunken lean, it's not a bad case.

If you're not familiar with subpixel layouts, here's why that's a very good thing. Today's OLED gaming monitors have an issue. Not a huge one for gaming—any OLED is superb for playing games on—but more noticeable on some panels than others when you're browsing your desktop. It's especially noticeable if you're regularly typing out pages of words. It's called text fringing. Text fringing, as the name suggests, appears as a colourful border around characters rendered on an OLED panel. Sort of like a chromatic aberration effect in-game. It happens because the subpixels—red, green, and blue—don't align exactly with how the text is being rendered. In some OLED panels, that's because the subpixels are arranged in a triangular pattern, though LG's popular panels include a white subpixel in an RGWB structure. Text fringing is most obvious on panels with lower pixel densities, so namely 1440p monitors, though it'd be better to be rid of it completely. Well, that's what LG is offering with its latest OLED panel. Announced ahead of CES 2026, LG'…",

Since Pretty Derby ended its four-year Japan-exclusive stint earlier this year, stables and owners of the real-life counterparts behind Umamusume's colourful cast of characters have been inundated with everything from an uptick in tourist visits to mountains of donated grass for the retired critters to feast upon. The Northern Lake crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 125M yen (0.8M USD).The completion of the new stable has also been moved up to March or April, and the day when Meisho Doto and Neko Punch can move out of their rundown house is drawing near.Blessings to all supporters! pic.twitter.com/MeCd0U4PvX December 22, 2025 And now another good deed, this time in the form of $800 thousand freakin' dollars to help renovate dilapidated stables. Back in October the Northern Lake Farm—home to the stable that houses the Umamusume-featured horse Meisho Doto—opened up a crowdfunding campaign in order to raise 15 million yen (around $95,000 USD) for repairs …",

In a Reddit post titled \"Remove this AI shit from the store\", user Willcario uploaded an image of a player card sticker named \"Winter Warning\", which comes as part of Battlefield 6's Windchill cosmetics pack. The sticker depicts a soldier aiming down the sight of an assault rifle. Upon closer inspection, however, the assault rifle clearly has two barrels, leading Willcario and other Battlefield 6 fans to suspect the sticker art is AI-generated. Accidental replication is certainly an error common among AI-generated images, as anyone who has seen AI-generated pictures of humans with far too many fingers will understand. That said, this image is the only evidence Willcario cites, meaning the mistake could potentially be down to human error. Nonetheless, Willcario makes his thoughts clear about the apparent use of generative AI. \"I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI-generated garbage,\" they say. \"You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI-generated rewards won with them.\" Willcario is referring to Act…",

One question put to Kojima ( timestamp ) relates to Metal Gear Solid 2, saying that AI control in the world is \"becoming a reality\" and asking whether Kojima predicted this era. To sum up in a sentence, and obviously spoilers ahead, MGS2 takes a very weird turn in its second half, with 'reality' collapsing around the protagonist Raiden as the player sits through a series of monologues about digital control, junk data, and our inability to parse the bewildering amounts of information created by the modern world. And that's simplifying things. \"MGS2 is often mistaken for a story about AI, but it's about digital society,\" says Kojima. \"MGS1 was about DNA. What isn't left in DNA are memes.

Games like Stellar Blade , Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth and Star Wars Outlaws reignited the debate about splashing liquid sunshine too liberally across platforms and obstacles to aid player navigation, with the debate spilling over into 2025 as critics called it out as lazy game design. Numerous game developers offered their perspectives on the issue. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth's director Naoki Hamaguchi stated there is \"definitely a need for that kind of thing\" in games, even if players don't like it, while The Witcher 4's lead designer believed the problem \"isn't necessarily the yellow paint\", but the context in which it was used, and that level designers needed to \"properly weaponise the entire arsenal of your toolkit\" to prevent players from realising that \"'oh, I'm being guided'\". Personally, I think it's easy to criticise developers for whipping out the paintbrush when more subtly guided level design becomes trickier to achieve.

John Carmack's reproduction of the smooth scrolling effect seen in Nintendo's platformer ultimately led to the founding of id Software and the creation of Commander Keen . In turn this led to Wolfenstein 3D , and ultimately to Doom . Yet as id Software prepared to revolutionise PC gaming, its publisher, Apogee, took the tech id had developed for Commander Keen and made its own take on the 2D platformer. The result was Bio Menace, a platform shooter in which you battle through a city infested with mutants as all-American action hero Snake Logan. Bio Menace was created almost entirely by programmer Jim Norwood, who worked on the Duke Nukem Trilogy and, later, the original Shadow Warrior and its 2013 reboot. Apogee released Bio Menace as freeware in 2005, and it can be played online in various places. But the original has, understandably, aged quite a bit.
