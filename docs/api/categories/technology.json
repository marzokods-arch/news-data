    "body": "An AI model released by Chinese AI company DeepSeek uses new techniques that could significantly improve AI’s ability to “remember.” Released last week, the optical character recognition (OCR) model works by extracting text from an image and turning it into machine-readable words. This is the same technology that powers scanner apps, translation of text in photos, and many accessibility tools.&nbsp; OCR is already a mature field with numerous high-performing systems, and according to the paper and some early reviews, DeepSeek’s new model performs on par with top models on key benchmarks. But researchers say the model’s main innovation lies in how it processes information—specifically, how it stores and retrieves memories. Improving how AI models “remember” information could reduce how much computing power they need to run, thus mitigating AI’s large (and growing) carbon footprint.&nbsp; Currently, most large language models break text down into thousands of tiny units called tokens. This turns the text into representations that models can understand. However, these tokens quickly become expensive to store and compute with as conversations with end users grow longer.

McKinsey earlier published a similar trend indicating that agentic AI would be the way forward to achieve huge operational benefits for enterprises. At The Wall Street Journal ’s Technology Council Summit , AI technology leaders recommended CIOs stop worrying about AI’s return on investment because measuring gains is difficult and if they were to try, the measurements would be wrong.&nbsp; This places technology leaders in a precarious position–robust tech stacks already sustain their business operations, so what is the upside to introducing new technology?&nbsp; For decades, deployment strategies have followed a consistent cadence where tech operators avoid destabilizing business-critical workflows to swap out individual components in tech stacks.

I talked to Suleyman about the tension at play when it comes to designing our interactions with chatbots and his ultimate vision for what this new technology should be.

First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending? I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs , the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.&nbsp; But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to perhaps not go all in on AI were nowhere to be found.

After years of growth that spawned hundreds of startups, the nascent carbon removal sector appears to be facing a reckoning. Running Tide, a promising aquaculture company, shut down its operations last summer, and a handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward Running Tide’s ambitious plans to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year. The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, experts warn. And the open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?
