Motorslice's demo has been out for a while now, but it was recently updated for Steam Next Fest . Its controls seem unwieldy at first, but they're mostly just demanding. Chainsaw-blade-wielding protagonist P controls a lot like Lara Croft in the early Tomb Raider games.

When said lawyer opposed the claims, they were then accused of defending their use of AI with, well, AI (via 404 Media ). Or, to put it more succinctly, in the words of judge Joel Coehn: \"Counsel relied upon unvetted AI—in his telling, via inadequately supervised colleagues—to defend his use of unvetted AI.\" The case itself involved a dispute between family members and a defaulted loan, usually a relatively straightforward proceeding. However, once the plaintiff brought to the court's attention the apparently AI-generated citations and quotes in the defense counsel's brief, the defense claimed that \"these passages were intended as paraphrases or summarized statements of the legal principles established in the cited authorities.\" The judge points out that the purported paraphrases included \"bracketed terms to indicate departure from a quotation (not something one would expect to see in an intended paraphrase) and comments such a…",

This might make you consider upgrading to Windows 11 because, well, this will be the very last time you'll be able to get a security update like this unless you get Extended Security Updates for a year (via Bleeping Computer ). Thankfully this isn't too difficult, though, as if you're logged into your Microsoft account and syncing your settings, you can opt-in for free via your Windows Settings. This patch applies regardless, though. The latest patch includes fixes for zero-day exploits including privilege escalation, secure boot bypass, memory corruption, and TPM information retrieval. 'Zero-day' means these exploits were discovered and exploitable before there was a fix released for them, meaning systems have been vulnerable to these ones until now.

If anything, it's a little too middle-of-the-road, but given my key enjoyment of the game has a lot to do with the shooting and very little to do with the dialogue, I was happy to let inoffensive text warble in the background. Given what we've had before in Borderlands 3, it was still a big improvement, and I even found myself charmed by one or two character moments. Not a terrible swerve from the outdated-on-launch memes, all told. The folks at Gearbox are happy with the feedback, too—Sam Winkler, the game's narrative lead, comments at a dev panel in Pax Australia 2025 (thanks, GamesRadar+ ): \"It's been great! It's been really good—I'll be honest, I'm really happy with it.\" And hey, you know what, Winkler isn't wrong to feel that way. Even when I'm at my most critical of videogame stories , I try to appreciate that game development is an utter nightmare—with the constant changing of hands, direction, and narrative most studios endure, it's more of a miracle that we have any good stories in the first place.

The reason is clear enough: demand from AI. \"Our competitors in the fight for supply are no longer our peers, but giant CSPs (cloud service providers),\" Chen said. By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output . Moreover, the AI-driven surge in demand is prompting manufacturers to prioritise production capacity for high-margin applications. Sound familiar?
