Starting next year, F1 will no longer be broadcast on ESPN—it’s moving to Apple TV in a five-year, $750 million deal. Apple boss Tim Cook has been seen at F1 races in the past, and earlier this year, Apple released F1: The Movie , starring Brad Pitt as a 50-something racing driver who improbably gets a second bite at the cherry 30 years after a brutal crash seemingly ended his F1 career. But securing the rights to the sport itself means Apple has snagged a very fast-growing series, with races almost every other week—currently, the sport has expanded to 24 races a year.

Some cars have numbers for names, and few more memorably than Porsche. Its most famous model shares its appellation with the emergency services here in North America; although the car should accurately be “nine-11,” you call it “nine-one-one.” Some numbers are less well-known, but perhaps more special to Porsche’s fans, especially those who like racing. 908. 917. 956. 962. 919. But how about 963? That’s Porsche’s current sports prototype, a 670-hp (500 kW) hybrid that for the last three years has battled against rivals in what is starting to look like, if not a golden era for endurance racing, then at least a very purple patch. And the 963 has done well, racing here in IMSA’s WeatherTech Sportscar Championship and around the globe in the FIA World Endurance Championship. Read full article Comments",

The AI-generated civics lesson plans we analyzed also left out opportunities for students to explore the stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized people. The allure of generative AI as a teaching aid has caught the attention of educators. A Gallup survey from September 2025 found that 60 percent of K-12 teachers are already using AI in their work , with the most common reported use being teaching preparation and lesson planning. Without the assistance of AI, teachers might spend hours every week crafting lessons for their students. With AI, time-stretched teachers can generate detailed lesson plans featuring learning objectives, materials, activities, assessments, extension activities, and homework tasks in a matter of seconds.

There have been important steps forward, including the successful reuse of the rocket’s massive Super Heavy booster. Clearly, SpaceX is getting really good at launching and recovering the 33-engine booster stage. But Starship itself, part spacecraft and part upper stage, hasn’t fared as well —at least it hadn’t until the last couple of months. After four Starships were destroyed in flight and on the ground in the first half of 2025, the last two missions ended with pinpoint splashdowns in the Indian Ocean. The most recent mission this week was arguably the most successful yet for Starship, which returned to Earth with little damage, suggesting SpaceX’s improvements to the heat shield are working.

There’s even a word for it: “enshittification,” named 2023 Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society. The term was coined by tech journalist/science fiction author Cory Doctorow , a longtime advocate of digital rights. Doctorow has spun his analysis of what’s been ailing the tech industry into an eminently readable new book, Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What To Do About It . As Doctorow tells it, he was on vacation in Puerto Rico, staying in a remote cabin nestled in a cloud forest with microwave Internet service—i.e., very bad Internet service, since microwave signals struggle to penetrate through clouds. It was a 90-minute drive to town, but when they tried to consult TripAdvisor for good local places to have dinner one night, they couldn’t get the site to load. “All you would get is the little TripAdvisor logo as an SVG filling your whole tab and nothing else,” Doctorow told Ars. “So I tweeted, ‘Has anyone at TripAdvisor ever been on a trip?

OnePlus was slower than most smartphone makers to embrace AI, but it’s full-steam ahead now with new Gemini integrations. OxygenOS 16 is described by OnePlus in grandiose terms as “a defiant rebellion for authenticity.” In the real world, this update is doing a lot of the same things as other AI-heavy smartphones.

The Supreme Court’s eventual decision in the case may determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of alleged pirates in order to avoid massive financial liability. Cox has argued that copyright-infringement notices—which are generated by bots and flag users based on their IP addresses—sent by record labels are unreliable.

The open source Doom port —which can trace its lineage back to the original launch of ZDoom back in 1998 —adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to the original Doom source code that John Carmack released in 1997. Now, though, the community behind GZDoom is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork called UZDoom . The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of GZDoom creator and maintainer Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl) , who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the GZDoom codebase. “Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we’ve decided that the best course of action was to fork the project,” developer Nash Muhandes wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday . “I don’t want to see the GZDoom legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is t…",

Seeking a “wide variety of documents”—including a sweeping request for all communications regarding Musk and all information on nonprofits’ funders and donations—OpenAI claimed that the subpoenas are intended to probe if Musk was involved in the actions or paid nonprofits to make critical comments, NBC News wrote in a report exhaustively documenting the controversy. But nonprofits have alleged it’s obvious that OpenAI is using the lawsuit to harass, silence, and intimidate its critics—most glaringly when it comes to targeting nonprofits that are even more publicly critical of Musk’s companies than they are of OpenAI.

As the planet heats up, more ice will melt at both poles, and recent research shows that Antarctica’s ice caps, glaciers, and floating ice shelves, as well as its sea ice, are just as vulnerable to warming as the Arctic. Both satellite data and field observations in Antarctica reveal alarming signs of a Greenland-like meltdown, with increased surface melting of the ice fields, faster-moving glaciers, and dwindling sea ice. Some scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that the rapid “Greenlandification” of Antarctica will have serious consequences, including an accelerated rise in sea levels and significant shifts in rainfall and drought patterns.

The image was taken by Zhang You of Yunnan, China. Another of You’s photographs placed 15th in this year’s contest. “It pays to dive deep into entomology: understanding insects’ behaviors and mastering lighting,” You said in a statement. “A standout work blends artistry with scientific rigor, capturing the very essence, energy, and spirit of these creatures.” There was an element of luck in creating his winning image, too. “I had observed rice weevils in grains before, but never one with its wings spread,” You said. “This one was naturally preserved on a windowsill, perhaps in a final attempt to escape. Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.” Read full article Comments",

In interviews, company officials said that if NASA wanted to buy Orion missions as a “service,” rather than owning and operating the spacecraft, they were ready to work with the space agency.
