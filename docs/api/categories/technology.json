One such feature is Google’s Take a Message in the Phone app , which automatically generates a text transcript of your voicemails.

The layoffs are expected to begin next week, matching earlier rumors that changes were coming on November 20. The scope of the cuts is unclear, though further changes and possible location closures are likely. Last week, we reported on rumors suggesting that employee layoffs at Verizon were imminent. At the time, there wasn’t much information outside of whispers from employees, but now a new report from Reuters adds further credence to the claims.

    "summary": "Android 17’s new Contacts Picker may provide a privacy-preserving way for apps to read your contacts.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new Contacts Picker tool for Android 17 to fix the current all-or-nothing contacts permission. This tool will allow you to share specific contacts with an app, rather than your entire contacts list. Access will be a one-time snapshot, and apps can request only the specific data fields they need. Your device’s contacts list holds a treasure trove of sensitive data that many apps want to get their hands on. Fortunately, Android’s permissions system prevents apps from accessing your contacts without your knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s an all-or-nothing system: You either grant an app access to all your contacts or none of them. This is highly problematic because it forces you to grant many apps full access to your contacts even if they don’t need it. Next year’s Android 17 update could tackle this problem by introducing a system Contacts Picker tool that allows you to select specific contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to your entire contacts list.

Reports have been piling up about the Pixel speakerphone button feeling slow or unresponsive during calls, and a problem with such a fundamental function is bound to be frustrating. We wanted to determine the actual extent of the issue among our readers. We reported on the buggy feature last week , outlining what appeared to be happening and the possible reasons behind it. Pixel 9 owners first raised the alarm back in May, and Pixel 10 owners have since joined them. The behaviour often looks the same — you tap the speakerphone toggle and nothing happens, or it takes a beat or two before it lights up. Some users have found workarounds for the issue, but these shouldn’t be necessary, and Google’s response to one reader didn’t do anything to alleviate concerns. We ran a poll to get a clearer picture of how often this is happening among our readership.",

If Google ever extends this tech to regular Chromebook users, it could finally make Chrome OS a real rival to cheap Windows laptops.

Google has officially rolled out Cameyo by Google, a rebranded and fully integrated version built right into the Chrome OS ecosystem .
