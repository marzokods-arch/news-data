After a few more steps and a stodgy lunch, I wander into the Ubisoft booth ready to play an upcoming hack 'n' slash roguelike that I've not heard of before but that still looks seriously cool. I've played through a few hack 'n' slash games before—I even played part of Ghostrunner 2 at the last Gamescom I went to—so I was prepared for what was to come, or at least I thought I was. (Image credit: Ubisoft ) Morbid Metal is like any other roguelike in that if you die during a run, you need to start again, facing new semi-procedurally generated levels each time. Set in a world where cybernetics and nature intertwine, you take the role of a few cybernetic ninjas fighting to uncover the origins of the mysterious world in which you find yourself. You progress through stunning levels first shrouded in cherry blossoms, traditional pagodas, and what seems to be old technologi…",

    "body": "Apple's new A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 was announced yesterday and the first Geekbench scores have been uploaded. To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench. The bottom line here is that Apple has long had a clear IPC or single-core and per-clock-cycle p…",

Where I might draw the line, however, is taking a sharp pair of metal cutting scissors to a brand new gaming handheld like the Nintendo Switch 2 —but then I wouldn't be able to fit a much bigger battery, like this intrepid YouTuber. Join me in saluting the bravado, then, of Naga, who's not only cracked open a Switch 2 on their YouTube channel , but gone at it with a pair of scissors to fit an 8000 mAh battery in place of the regular 5220 mAh unit. As you'd expect, the new battery is physically larger than the old model, both in height and depth, requiring a significant chunk of a thin internal metal frame to be cut away in order to fit it within the plastic chassis. Double points for fitting the weebiest battery possible, too, a bright yellow, anime character-emblazoned model. Anyway, after a handy bit of rewiring (and a quick clean down wi…",

Uncovered by an industrious Redditor , the new ending can be found in the quest called The Lion's Den. That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is. In which case, you stroll into camp, draw your sword, and promptly massacre like a billion enemy soldiers.

From the looks of it, this AI mod tries to keep the villagers as close to their character as possible. The game code itself wasn't changed, but the dialogue strings within said code, of course, were. The method Josh settled upon was to use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to write data directly into a memory address in the GameCube's RAM. He used a bespoke Python memory scanner and \"after hours of talking\" to the in-game villagers and scanning, the memory addresses were found and \"I could now reliably read who was talking and,…",
