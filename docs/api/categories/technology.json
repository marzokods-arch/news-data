    "body": "Tempest Rising developer Slipgate Ironworks has officially introduced superweapons into its action-packed RTS, adding massively powerful instruments of destruction for each of its factions. But when Slipgate revealed its digital WMD's last week, it also hinted there was more big news on the horizon for its Command & Conquer tribute. At the time, I speculated this would be the long-awaited addition of a third playable faction to the RTS, and I was right! Well, sort of. Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns. They're radically different from the RTS' existing human factions—the technologically advanced GDF and industrious, inventive Tempest Dynasty—summoning buildings rather than constructing them, and attacking their enemies with laser-toting floating pyramids and ground troops that shoot bees. Slipgate explained how the Veti function in a Steam post , outlining three fundamental mechanics. First, the Veti can convert slain enemies to their side, reanim…",

But the troubled city-builder has received some significant TLC lately. November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too. As Colossal Order concedes in a recent Steam post , development of the asset editor has been \"long underway\", with the community clamouring for it more or less since the sequel launched. The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\". Citing issues such as lingering Unity dependencies and the large amount of in-built assets affected by the editor's addition. In any case, those issues have seemingly been resolved. Colossal Order's aim with the asset editor is to let players \"create complex assets on par with official content\", and the tool has a few interesting features to make this easier for players.

Creative intention comes from human artists, number one,\" Howard said. \"But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster?\" As most recently demonstrated by publisher Running With Scissors' thermonuclear 48-hour Postal flameout , AI remains a hotly contested topic in the games industry.

Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year.

    "body": "Spry Fox, the Seattle-based studio behind cozy games like Cozy Grove , got purchased by Netflix back in 2022 when the streaming giant was really trying to get into this whole videogame thing. While the acquisition did bear fruit—an upcoming mobile co-op life sim called Spirit Crossing —Spry Fox is parting ways with its owner after just three years, as reported by Game File . Netflix is still on publishing duties for Spirit Crossing's mobile release, but it sounds like the now independent Spry Fox is keen to put the game on other platforms too. The Game File article shares a statement from studio co-founder David Edery: \"Spirit Crossing was built to connect the world, bring people together and inspire kindness, so being able to bring the game to as many players, across different platforms, is truly the best thing for the game.\" It seems to be a more peaceable transition than Netflix's sudden closure of Team Blue , which happened before the developer ever released a game. Both indicate shifting priorities for Netflix Games, though, which got a new president in ex-Epic exec Alain Tascan last year . Shortly after the closure of Team Blue, Netflix laid off an undisclosed number of peop…",

Alas, no, as it turns out that a very popular web app framework, used heavily in servers around the world, has been discovered to have a maximum severity security bug. The software packages in question are React Server Components, and the developers issued a rather alarming statement about a critical security vulnerability earlier this week (via The Register and Wiz ). Specifically, the vulnerability \"allows unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints.\" Translating this to something more understandable, it basically means somebody can use a remote web request of a server running React JavaScript or a React-based application framework, and ultimately run dodgy code to extract data, override systems, or what have you. It's so bad that it has a maximum severity rating on the CVE database . Fortunately, React's developers created a fix alm…",

Naturally, I just assumed the player had died, and the game had bugged to make their death pose look a little funky. It turns out that I was almost bang on the money. Now illuminated having watched Jinko's latest Arc Raiders mythbusting video, I've learned that these players stuck in place are the result of forcing the game closed, such as the ol' ALT+F4 or disconnecting—not from being killed or even surrendering to return to the main menu. Because you've been forced out of the match, you're able to rejoin and pick right up where you left off if you haven't been killed in your absence. As you'll see in the timestamped video above, this peculiarity can lead to some very amusing events.

AMD's Lisa Su has weighed in on the debate. Recently, in an interview with Wired , the AMD chief was asked if she thought AI was a bubble. Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment. Investment is certainly there when it comes to AI. Nvidia is the first company to have been valued at $5 trillion . Nvidia, in turn, invested $100 billion into OpenAI back in S…",

Alas, he's been in a state of kind-of-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, and others, but generally contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote.
