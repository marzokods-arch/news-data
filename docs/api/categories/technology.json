McKinsey earlier published a similar trend indicating that agentic AI would be the way forward to achieve huge operational benefits for enterprises. At The Wall Street Journal ’s Technology Council Summit , AI technology leaders recommended CIOs stop worrying about AI’s return on investment because measuring gains is difficult and if they were to try, the measurements would be wrong.&nbsp; This places technology leaders in a precarious position–robust tech stacks already sustain their business operations, so what is the upside to introducing new technology?&nbsp; For decades, deployment strategies have followed a consistent cadence where tech operators avoid destabilizing business-critical workflows to swap out individual components in tech stacks.

On the one hand, he thinks that the industry is taking AI in a dangerous direction by building chatbots that present as human: He worries that people will be tricked into seeing life instead of lifelike behavior. In August, he published a much-discussed post on his personal blog that urged his peers to stop trying to make what he called “ seemingly conscious artificial intelligence ,” or SCAI. On the other hand, Suleyman runs a product shop that must compete with those peers. Last week, Microsoft announced a string of updates to its Copilot chatbot , designed to boost its appeal in a crowded market in which customers can pick and choose between a pantheon of rival bots that already includes ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and more. I talked to Suleyman about the tension at play when it comes to designing our interactions with chatbots and his ultimate vision for what this new technology should be. One key Copilot update is a group-chat feature that lets multiple people talk to the chatbot at the same time. A big part of the idea seems to be to stop people from falling down a rabbit hole in a one-o…",

First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending? I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs , the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.&nbsp; But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to perhaps not go all in on AI were nowhere to be found.

It comes with ChatGPT built in, along with an agent, so that you can browse, get direct answers, and have automated tasks performed on your behalf all at the same time. I’ve spent the past several days tinkering with Atlas.

When I was browsing Amazon, I asked the Atlas agent to do some shopping for me, using a pre-set prompt of its own suggestion. (“Start a cart with items I&#8217;m likely to want based on my browsing here and highlight any active promo codes. Let me review before checkout.”) It picked out a notebook that I’d recently purchased and no longer needed, some deodorant I’d recently purchased and no longer needed,…",

After years of growth that spawned hundreds of startups, the nascent carbon removal sector appears to be facing a reckoning. Running Tide, a promising aquaculture company, shut down its operations last summer, and a handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn’t made a whole lot more progress toward Running Tide’s ambitious plans to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year. The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, experts warn. And the open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there?

    "body": "How are you feeling? I’m genuinely interested in the well-being of all my treasured Checkup readers, of course. But this week I’ve also been wondering how science and technology can help answer that question—especially when it comes to pain. In the latest issue of MIT Technology Review magazine, Deena Mousa describes how an AI-powered smartphone app is being used to assess how much pain a person is in . The app, and other tools like it, could help doctors and caregivers. They could be especially useful in the care of people who aren’t able to tell others how they are feeling. But they are far from perfect. And they open up all kinds of thorny questions about how we experience, communicate, and even treat pain. Pain can be notoriously difficult to describe, as almost everyone who has ever been asked to will know. At a recent medical visit, my doctor asked me to rank my pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I found it incredibly difficult to do. A 10, she said, meant “the worst pain imaginable,” which brought back unpleasant memories of having appendicitis. A short while before the problem that brought me in, I’d broken my toe in two places, which had hurt like a mother—but less than append…",

In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers. Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector. Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged.
