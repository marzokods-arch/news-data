I thought it had peaked when Jason Charles Miller sang To The Edge in Shadowbringers— the man was on an episode of The Osbournes, y'all .

In a tweet posted a few hours before the ceremony, they shared a screenshot of two image folders on a Windows desktop: \"memes if we win GOTY\" and \"memes if we don't win GOTY.\" The latter turned out to come in clutch, as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was shut out of every category it was nominated for. And it lost every single one of those to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG took home Best RPG, Best Narrative, and Game of the Year, all major categories Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was nominated in. The loss of those first two elicited a 'This is fine' meme post, but Game of the Year followed with the killing blow. Kingdom Come's social account responded to that disappointment with a perfect dialogue option from KCD1. ggwp @expedition33 😉 pic.twitter.com/ZPl55G1CW4 December 12, 2025 They really did have their memes prepared for the moment—I'm now wondering what they would've posted if Hollow Knight: Silksong had nabbed the top prize.

While this title appears to be very early in development, judging by the cinematic trailer revealed at the Game Awards and no mention of a release window, it is quite promising as Star Wars games go. The original director of Knights of the Old Republic, Casey Hudson, is returning as director on this new game, albeit, as part of his newly founded Arcanaut Studios. Hudson is responsible for directing some of the most popular sci-fi RPGs ever made, including the very popular Mass Effect series, during his tenure at BioWare. While there isn't all that much to glean from the trailer, an official interview on starwars.com has provided quite a bit of additional context about the game and the developers' intention. Is there a Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic release date? (Image credit: Arcanaut Studios) There is no official release date or window for Fate of the Old Republic.

In some ways similar to traditional chip stacking, one research team has created a way to implement an extra layer of microscopic switches on an already completed die, by sticking them where the power and signals go. Okay, so that's a very rough description of the work conducted by MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Waterloo, and Samsung Electronics. But when you read the details about it in the press release on the matter, you'll see that it's a tad difficult to describe it all in just one sentence. Traditional CMOS chips are fabricated by applying and then etching repeated layers of different materials, applied to a wafer of ultra-pure silicon. The bottom-most layer, also known as the front end according to MIT, comprises the transistors of the chips (or capacities, in the case of DRAM). However, these need to be fed a current in order to work, plus you need to be able to read and write data to groups of transistors that form lo…",

The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful. Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers.
