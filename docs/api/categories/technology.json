A skitarii cyborg maybe, or a ratling, or an arco-flagellant. Instead, we got the hive scum. If you were hoping for one of those alien orangutans who are also scientific geniuses I can see how a new character who is basically just the gang punk who gets beat up by the hero in act one of an action movie could seem underwhelming. If you wanted to play a Sister of Battle in full power armor and were instead offered a normal drug addict, I sympathize. The way the Darktide subreddit immediately filled their nappies in rage over the hive scum reveal was a bit much, though. The hive scum wasn't what I expected, but after leveling one up, it's actually a super fun class to play. Maybe \"dual-wielding\" isn't as big a deal as it was in the Rise of the Triad days, but having a character class who can shoot two pistols at once makes clearing crowds deliciously easy. Especially when paired with the Desperado ability, which lets me reload for free, even when I'm out of ammo, as well as dodge ranged fire, and can be upg…",

But those same things are broadly true of Far Cry Primal, a game that probably isn't an immsim, or at least not acknowledged as one by immsim fans. How can that be? Well, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain took to his YouTube channel Monday to try and get down to brass tacks. It might seem like an odd subject for Cain to tackle, given that, as he notes in the video, \"so many of my hundreds and hundreds … of videos are me talking about roleplaying games because that's pretty much all I've made since 1993.\" He has even tried to define \"RPG\" in the past, which seems even harder than defining immsim because there are a hell of a lot more of them.

I liked certain scenes, I liked certain ideas, I liked certain overarching themes; I especially liked the scenery. But the actual moment-to-moment storytelling was so clumsily executed that I was left genuinely baffled. It's a real shame, too, because the changeover from long-time writing lead Natsuko Ishikawa should've been a great opportunity to get some fresh blood into the mix. Ishikawa's been helming the story since Shadowbringers, and she's done a sterling job.

Once sold out, it will no longer be available.\" The disclaimer still there , and at least in the US, that original model is sold out for good. It may not have the delectable, vivid colors of the OLED version, but it was a hell of a workhorse for the price. PC Gamer's Jeremy Laird called it a \" stellar deal \" when the price dropped a few months back and I'm inclined to agree with him; PC gaming has a reputation for its high financial barrier to entry, so to have a handheld option with bespoke UI and docking functionality for under $400 was a pretty wild value proposition (even with consoles on the table).

Some are pretty easy, some are pretty hard, and hopefully some will make you curious to go play something you didn't get around to in 2025.

But occasionally there's a new game that catches my cautious eye: The Finals , Escape from Tarkov , and Stormgate , to name a few. This year, that game was Killing Floor 3 . Actually, it was on my radar prior to this year, because Killing Floor is a series of games very close to my heart. The original wasn't the first game I played on PC—that award goes to either Call of Duty 4 or Team Fortress 2—but it was close. Killing Floor came out in 2009, when I was 14 years old, and I got hooked on it.

Perhaps it's because Anshar's studios reboot made some major changes to Painkiller's formula, reworking People Can Fly's devoutly singleplayer horde shooter as a Left 4 Dead -style cooperative blaster infused with Doom Eternal -ish movement. The combination was ambivalently received by those who did notice Painkiller's release, with the game receiving a Mixed rating from just under 600 Steam reviews. The reboot did not go down well with Painkiller's creator, Adrian Chmielarz. Speaking to PCGamesN , Chmielarz says he played Anshar's reboot in beta. To say he wasn't impressed is putting it mildly. \"I disagreed with every single thing they've done in it,\" he told the site. Oof.

Many Nightreign players, including myself, got used to running similar setups for boosting damage output as much as possible without having to waste too much time in a run. The shrinking, battle royale-style circle doesn't give you a lot of time to dawdle, so the meta revolved around a specific relic that gives you attack power for defeating summonable bosses around the map via evergaols—which is far easier than searching for bosses and hoping to find good random rewards. Here's the thing: The new map in the DLC features zero evergaols. The relic that lots of players have relied on to easily route through the map is unusable if you want to do the new stuff. You have to actually explore again and figure out an efficient route every time you drop in, which is made even tougher by how labyrinthine the layout is.

    "body": "Despite billions of dollars in investment and backing from tech titans like Nvidia and even the likes of the UK government , the mighty force of Google still seemingly scares OpenAI, or at least that's according to CEO Sam Altman. Recently, Altman took to Alex Kantrowitz's podcast , Big Technology, to talk about the AI company. The backdrop of this conversation between Sam Altman and Alek Kantrowitz is the ' code red ' alert that Altman recently declared in response to Google's Gemini 3. OpenAI has had the lead for some time, yet Google's rapid improvement has seemingly worried the top dog of OpenAI. This is so important to the conversation that, barring introductions, it's actually how Kantrowitz sets up the conversation. Altman says that code reds are actually quite common for the company. He says, \"I think that it's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges\". He also states, \"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space\". In fact, he argues that Google had a code red-style crisis on its hands when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, but didn't take OpenAI …",

    "body": "TSMC is the biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the world with 70% foundry market share . Its chip fabs are mostly based in Taiwan , but it does also have one fab in Japan, two in China and, more pertinently to this story, two in the USA: one 8-inch fab in Washington, and one 12-inch fab in Arizona. However, neither of these lattermost fabs are TSMC's very best, nor will they ever be. TSMC is accelerating its plans for 1.4 nm silicon manufacturing , with the hopes of going into full production in 2027. However, according to the Central News Agency , that bleeding-edge tech won't be coming to TSMC's stateside fabs any time soon due to Taiwan's ‘National Core Technologies’ regulations (via Dan Nystedt on X ). As per these regulations, TSMC can only transfer production tech that is at least two generations old to its fabs outside of Taiwan. This point arose during the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee, when Taiwan People's Party legislator Liu Shu-pin expressed concern about how the Taiwanese government can ensure key R&D advancements in semiconductor tech stay in Taiwan. National Science Council Vice Chairman Lin Fa-cheng reassured that the list of 'national core …",

However, not all chips need to be fabricated this way, which is why Intel is only just making the transition to 8 nm for its motherboard chipsets. More importantly, though, it seems that it won't be the US chip giant that will be making them, but Samsung instead. That's according to a news report by The Korean Economic Daily , aka Hankyung (via Tom's Hardware ). Sources within the industry have told the publication that Samsung is \"on the verge of securing an order for Intel's 8 nm chips.\" It's not talking about the company's CPUs or GPUs, though, but rather its PCHs or platform controller hubs. Better known as a motherboard chipset, these little dies are responsible for handling the control signals and data flows between the CPU and all the peripheral slots and ports (PCIe sockets, M.2 slots, USB, etc). Intel doesn't provide a huge amount of information about how and where these chips are made, but in general, they're not manufactured via cutting-edge process nodes. Rather than using Intel 7 or …",

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . I try to never get my hopes too high before a game release. I know that may seem odd, seeing how enthusiastic I am about all things all the time. I've burnt myself before on the flame of anticipation, and I swore never to do it again., Well, sort of, because even I couldn't hide my excitement for Silent Hill f . I had played Silent Hill 2's remake the year before, and while it was nice to be in a higher-res version of the foggy mountain town, it didn't quench my thirst for a new Silent Hill experience. I'd seen it all before. I wanted new horrors, a new twisty story, and a new protagonist to guide through the chaos. But if I had known then what I know now, I wouldn't have been so quick to dismiss the future of Silent Hill—the experience I craved was just on the horizon.

That's because its chip-making and die-packaging services appear to have captured the interest of Apple, Broadcom, and Google for future processors and other semiconductor devices. This is all according to a report by GF Securities HK Brokerage Ltd , with Jukan on X offering a key snippet. One particular table shows Intel's 18A-P and 14A process nodes, as well as its EMIB ( Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge ) packaging technology, being used by Apple for a 'smartphone SoC' and a non-specified ASIC, as well as Google for a future tensor processing unit (TPU), plus several others. I didn’t see this coming…It looks like Apple’s ASIC—and an unidentified Broadcom ASIC as well—may be using Intel for back-end packaging. https://t.co/zidXMELTOa pic.twitter.com/gt3Y1OKTTB December 18, 2025 Another post by Jukan also shows commentary from GF Securities that claims AMD and Nvidia are considering Intel's 14A process node for their server SKUs, though the exact wording of \"we continue to expect the likely engagement\"…",
