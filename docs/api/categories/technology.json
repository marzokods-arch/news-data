That's not to mention the bizarre accusations being flung around from its co-CEOs. Former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies blamed the game's failure on \" internal and external saboteurs, \" a sentiment that had been echoed by Mark Gerhard just a couple of months prior when he popped off on Discord to claim that the negative reactions to the game were \"100%\" financed by someone . A mystery someone. It's enough of a palaver to make anyone wary of trying again, and IOI CEO Hakan Abrak certainly seems apprehensive to re-enter the lion's den. During a recent interview with IGN , Abrak reflected on the initial response to MindsEye: \"It was a tough reception,\" he said. \"It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners.

After a charming stop-motion vignette in which Ara's friends have to find his bones to turn him back from stone, the host reveals his face for the first time—dressed in a suit to deliver the final bit of news, that Silksong is, in fact, releasing today. \"We finally, finally made it,\" he says, adding that he's been doing this for, in a massive understatement, \"quite a long time. \"Enough time for many things in one's life to change—and a lot of things have changed in my life during that time.

As noted by the Guardian , Barry Lynn, the executive director of the Open Market Institute thinktank, says, “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.” Nidhi Hedge, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project , argues, \"You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot… Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolisation and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly.

I pick up loot and have no idea if it's good or not, the gigantic skill tree gives me chills, and I couldn't tell you anything about the lore. I'm willing to endure the most prickly parts of PoE 2 because the campaign is excellent—and it just got better. The latest update adds a new act that has me fully on board with Grinding Gear Games' vision for an action RPG campaign that might be as ambitious as the version of Diablo 2 that exists in people's memories. I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG …",

Panther Lake, of course, is Intel's critical new mobile CPU that will debut the once all-important 18A node. Expected to be branded Intel Core Ultra 300 Series, Panther Lake sports Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores, with the mix rumoured to be four P-cores and 12 E-cores. Perhaps more exciting for us, Panther Lake will have Intel's next-gen \"Celestial\" Xe3 graphics tech, with the rumour being a maximum of 12 Xe3 cores. Intel's current Lunar Lake laptop chip has eight Xe2-spec iGPU cores and is pretty competitive with AMD's equivalent Strix Point laptop in gaming terms. So, 12 Xe3 cores should represent a decent gaming upgrade. Panther Lake is also going to bring a big boost in AI performance.

Maybe things would pick up once I started earning better gear. This season, I committed myself to the grind; to finding out if I was wrong, if things weren't as bad as I feared. Now that I've achieved power level 400, I can definitively say that, no, it's actually so much worse. It's not just that the power grind feels unrewarding—although it does. This new version of Destiny 2 fails across the board. It fails in ways that would never happen if you were creating a game from the ground up; its issues partly a result of crowbarring the old version of the game into this ill-fitting suit.
