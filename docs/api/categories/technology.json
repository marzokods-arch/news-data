Granted, not all of the clips OpenAI shares in its announcement are flawless, with its AI-generated snippet of a practicing martial artist featuring a warping bo staff and smooshed phalanges. Still, OpenAI is keen to highlight Sora 2's gains in depicting consistent body mechanics that adhere to the rules of the physical world; the twirling body horror of earlier models generated gymnastics clips may be a thing of the past. The company also touts Sora 2's ability to \"directly inject elements of the real world\" into its AI-generated clips. It elaborates, \"For example, by observing a video of one of our teammates, the model can insert them into any Sora-generated environment with an accurate portrayal of appearance and voice. This capability is very general, and works for any human, animal or object.\" If you're so inclined to descend into the realm of deepfakes, the Sora app, po…",

    "body": "EA went private in a Saudi-backed $55 billion deal earlier this week, and pretty much no one with a net worth south of $100 million is happy about it. Least happy of all? The staff of EA's myriad studios, who now have to wonder if their jobs are going under the guillotine to make Mohammed bin Salman and Jared Kushner's pocketbooks a little happier. With EA now on the hook for a $20 billion debt to JP Morgan in the wake of its leveraged buyout, frantic cost-cutting (and, joy of joys, AI ) seems inevitable. Especially worried are the staff at BioWare, which hasn't chalked up an unalloyed win since 2021's Mass Effect Legendary Edition and which hasn't chalked one up with an actually new game since 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. In a chat with Insider Gaming , anonymous staff at the RPG developer sound like they're just waiting for the axe to fall. \"I’ve been doing it since last year, but I’m making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,\" said one source, who added that it \"Kind of feels like a matter of time\" before things turn dark for the studio.

The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb!

Multiple authorities take him to task for daring to play hero, all for entirely self-serving reasons, until an older witcher named Preston Holt steps in to save Geralt and position himself as the boy's new mentor. Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for.

For me, it is undoubtedly the nostalgic scream of a dial-up modem. Strap 12 of those bad boys together, and you've really got something special—as YouTube channel The Serial Port has recently demonstrated (via Hackaday ). The self-described 'virtual museum' showcases tech from yesteryear, this time exploring Multilink Point to Point Protocol. Dating back to 1994, this far from widely used tech allowed users with too many modems on their hands to combine multiple connections into one, potentially doubling their internet speed. So, why did The Serial port then strap 12 dial up modems together, specifically ? To utilise Multilink PPP and attempt to stream YouTube over multiple 56 Kbps internet connections. After a little bit of maths, the creators worked out that they'd need at least a 182,286 bits per second connection to watch one of their own recent uploads at 240p resolution (YouTube's lowest video quality on desktop) without buffering. Now, I know what you're thinking: 'But even if you round that…",

It was when Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that, in addition to an up-rezzed redo of the third Yakuza, it was going to release an entire bonus Gaiden game as well: Dark Ties , starring Y3 bad guy Yoshitaka Mine. I've played a little Dark Ties , and it's good fun going absolutely ham on the unsuspecting punks of Kamurocho as Mine, but there was almost a world where we would never have gotten to play him at all. RGG's original plan was for the Dark Ties' story to be, uh, basically a video they bundled onto the Kiwami 3 disc. It was \"something that could be viewed like a video,\" Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties director Ryosuke Horii recently told Famitsu (translated by Automaton ). So, you know, DarkTies.mp4 in other words. Thankfully, the devs at RGG realised it'd be much cooler if you actually got to step into Mine's immaculate Florsheims. Making Mine playable was, says Horii, \"the best way to tell his story,\" which is a very game developer response to the question, 'Why did you make this a videogame?' But Yakuza producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto points out there are other reasons RGG might f…",

Tom's Hardware was invited out to test out both the Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips recently, reporting test scores that look fittingly great. These are early numbers from benchmarks prechosen by Qualcomm, so it won't paint the whole picture, but they're impressive nonetheless. First off, in single-core CPU loads on Geekbench, the X2 Elite Extreme manages to get a score of 4080, which is 39% faster than the Snapdragon X Elite. Compared to the competition, the Strix Point AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 manages to get 2881, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H gets a score of 3026, and even Apple's M4 only got 3872. Then in multi-core tests, the X2 Elite Extreme received a score of 23491, which is double that of the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, which got 11306. The closest score of the suite to the X2 Elite Extreme is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, which managed to get 17680. Benchmarks X2 Elite…",

In mod project timelines, this is basically a nanosecond turnaround. If you're not familiar, OpenMW is an open-source engine reimplementation for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind that lets you run it on modern Windows, Linux, and macOS with a minimum of fuss and at modern resolutions. It's undoubtedly my go-to way to play these days, especially now this 0.50 release candidate has made the game way easier to play on a gamepad. Don't tell anyone, but my first exposure to Morrowind was its original Xbox version, with its uncharismatic sans-serif fonts and its tendency to slyly reboot your entire console to cope with its strict RAM limits. I still have nostalgia for its gamepad iteration and, hell, I just like being able to kick back on my sofa or play things easily on my Steam Deck. \"Despite the nice round number, 0.50.0 is a focused release,\" writes OpenMW's capo (that's their name, not their rank), \"its core highlight is…",

According to Windows Latest , Microsoft entered into a partnership with Ookla back in 2023 to provide Bing's speed test widget, and the new taskbar feature is just a more local redirect to this Bing widget. Windows Insiders can either launch the speed test from the Wi-Fi quick settings menu or by simply right-clicking the network icon in the system tray on the right-most side of the taskbar.

A post on the 2XKO X account reads: \"We need a little more time to get early access up and running, so we'll be shutting down closed beta a few days early on Oct 3 @ 9pm PT.\" Servers will be back up and running in time for the early access launch on October 7 at 8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST. Riot says that offline mode will still work, so players should still be able to hit the lab, play local multiplayer, and face off against CPUs. Three-and-a-half days to do some tinkering behind the scenes is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially when I think about other fighting games who took their betas offline and straight-up vanished for a year— looking at you, Multiversus.
