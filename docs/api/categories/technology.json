Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud.

NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) Scientists have discovered over 6,000 planets that orbit stars other than our Sun, known as exoplanets. More than half of these planets were discovered thanks to data from NASA’s retired Kepler mission and NASA’s current TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission. However, the enormous treasure trove of data from these missions still contains many yet-to-be-discovered planets. All of the data from both missions is publicly available in NASA archives, and many teams around the world have used that data to find new planets using a number of techniques.

If the tool determines that you’re under the age of 18, extra protections will be placed on your account to reduce exposure to inappropriate content. Anyone who is incorrectly placed in the under-18 category will have to verify their age with a selfie. Since last year, YouTube has been cracking down on non-age-verified accounts. Although the goal is to protect the platform’s youngest viewers, the age-prediction system YouTube deployed has wrongly ensnared countless accounts owned by adults. If you’re tagged by the system, you can restore full access to your account, but only if you provide proof of your age first. Now OpenAI is following YouTube’s lead and rolling its own age-prediction system for ChatGPT accounts. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

However, this feature apparently keeps getting added and removed between stable updates. Google also added a portrait lock toggle in beta releases, but the setting hasn’t made its way to the stable release yet, causing further confusion. Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
