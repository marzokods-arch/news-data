It's technically interesting, but super expensive and arguably not that powerful, for the money at least. Now no lesser an authority than John Carmack, he of OG Doom fame, reckons the little gold box of AI power has thermal issues limiting its performance. And that has us doubting whether the chip inside the DGX Spark would make for a good laptop APU, more on which in a moment. In a post on X, Carmack says his DGX is topping out at just 100 watts of power draw , far below what he says is the DGX's 240 watts rating. The result is roughly half the performance quoted by Nvidia. DGX Spark appears to be maxing out at only 100 watts power draw, less than half of the rated 240 watts, and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted performance (assuming 1 PF sparse FP4 = 125 TF dense BF16) . It gets quite hot even at this level, and I saw a report… October 27, 2025 Despite that lowly performance, Carmack says the DGX still gets quite hot and he claims to have seen reports of spontaneous rebooting, implying even more serious thermal issues. All of which leads Carmack to ponder whether Nv…",

Civ 7's Ages system divides games into three historical phases, and a lot happens in the transitions between them: Wars end, important variables are reset, and most importantly, players pick a new civilization to lead in the next age. It's a more historical approach to grand strategy, in that you can no longer found the United States at the same time as the invention of agriculture, and was one way Firaxis hoped to encourage players to actually finish the games they started rather than getting bored and bailing prematurely (which it noticed a lot of us doing).

Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case.
