The reason why all of that is now required was also laid bare, and it's AI. The message in question came from Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology. In it, she confirmed that the retail and server giant is reducing its workforce: \"While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles.\" Galetti says that Amazon's recruiting teams will \"prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.\" The obvious questions to ask are just what roles have been laid off, and what positions are such people expected to take on?
