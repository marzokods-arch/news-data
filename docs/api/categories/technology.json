Thanks to Sydney-based web developer Arin Sarkisian, Doom now runs on a pair of earbuds. More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM.

However, it seems some players are unhappy with the game's balancing, and their complaints are primarily why 28% of reviews are negative on Steam . On Friday, Big Distraction released an update to Lort making some adjustments to its challenge. But they also don't seem entirely happy about it. In a Steam post accompanying the update, Big Distraction addressed the issue of Lort's challenge. While it doesn't quite amount to \"git gud\", Big Distraction said that players shouldn't come to Lort expecting an easy ride. \"Lort is a roguelike and isn't meant to be a super easy game,\" the post reads. \"You are meant to die and learn how to overcome the challenge of each new level, enemy and boss.

A significant chunk of the appeal of them, just like The Elder Scrolls, is the option to flick back and forth between first-person and third-person at the press of a button. When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods.

Rubbing some salt in the wound, Reddit posts claiming to come from a developer who worked on the project say that \"it was close to the finish line.\" The redditor, posting under the name SocramVelmar, wrote \"Although the game was close to release, development stopped suddenly due to internal uncertainty and concerns around layoffs. With things unclear, some of the team moved on to other studios that offered more stability.\" If it was close to completion, you may be wondering, why not put in a little more effort to get it out the door?

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him.

    "body": "Wednesday, Ubisoft announced a \" major reset \" of its organizational hierarchy and game development plans that CEO Yves Guillemot said would foster \"the conditions for a return to sustainable growth.\" That included a fundamental shakeup to its internal studio structure, the cancellation of six projects including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake , and for some reason, a promise that more \"player-facing generative AI\" was on the way . As you might expect when a company announces everything is on fire, everything is on fire: as CNBC pointed out a day after the announcement, the company's share price went down by around 34% after the restructuring was announced. When the stock market closed yesterday the price sat at €4.06 (around $4.80) a share. This marks the lowest point in a long downward trajectory going back to 2021 as you can observe on CNBC's website , and it's the lowest share price the company has seen since 2011—the year it reported a $74 million loss . While it's not the lowest the share price has ever been, nor is it perhaps as dicey as the hostile takeover Vivendi backed off from in 2018 , it signals the graveness of this moment for the company.

But a new trailer reveals that The Killing Stone will be ready for business next month, and I'm beginning to think it might be one of the early bangers of 2026. The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens. As you can hear in the trailer, the game boasts some hefty voice-acting talent…",

For PC gamers with one Blood remaster already in their Steam library, the highlight of the package wasn't anything technical—it was the addition of the concluding part of one of Blood's best mods. That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could. But as he explains in a post on ModDB \"Responsibilities and life got in the way. As did a trickle of small issues.\" Still, it hasn't been that long since Blood: Refres…",

Some of these are fun, quirky spinoffs like Nightmare Kart, while others are more serious efforts to replicate Bloodborne's atmosphere. One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass.

So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

Not that they're making the choice subversively; in fact, the software giant has been happy for its staff to try out various AI coding tools, including its own GitHub Copilot, Anthropic's Claude 4, and OpenAI's GPT-5. Apparently, Microsoft started the whole experiment last year , but just in the developer division, resulting in Claude Sonnet 4 being selected as the AI choice for paid users of GitHub Copilot, though the option to use others is still available. The Verge writes that now any staff member involved in 'Experiences + Devices' (i.e. Windows, Bing, 365, Surface, and so on) is being encouraged to experiment with Claude, even if they have no coding experience at all. The expectation of those who can and do code…",

Minecraft developer Mojang certainly seems aware of the resemblance: In a post on Bluesky , lead Minecraft designer and Mojang CCO Jens Bergensten said Hytale is \"very polished\" but he'd \"like it to be more different,\" as its current state leaves him feeling that he'd \"just rather play Minecraft.\" Simon Collins-Laflamme, founder and CEO of Hytale developer Hypixel, has since acknowledged Bergensten's feedback with a surprisingly candid response on X , saying the lead Mojang dev is \"probably right\" to prefer a full-featured Minecraft to Hytale's early days—but he hopes his studio's plans for Hytale's future will eventually change that assessment. Jebs saying Hytale feels very polished is the best compliment we could ever get. He is someone I respect very much, and I know he doesn't talk much publicly about other games, so I appreciate that.

Steve Downes takes particular issue with the nightmare scenario of AI being trained on real-life voice recordings to imitate those actors, whether living or dead. In a YouTube AMA ( spotted by GamesRadar+ ) Downes says he never wants to see AI used to replicate his voice. \"That's where we cross a line that gets into an area that I am uncomfortable with,\" says Downes. \"I'm not a proponent. I don't like it, and I would prefer that it not be done.\" Perhaps conscious that he works in an industry where AI use is increasingly widespread, and does offer limited use cases, Downes does go on to slightly soften his stance outside of the topic of his own voice. AI can have \"many, many positive effects on not only showbusiness but humanity in general\" says Downes, but \"can also be something that deprives the actor of his work. I'll go on the record with that.\" It's not quite Neil Newborn, Astarian in Baldur's Gate 3 among many other things, coming out and saying of AI : \"It's shit… AI sucks.\" But at least it shows…",
