I'm going to go with the New Vegas package first, because I'm a sucker for big boxes and game statues: It does indeed come in a big box, and also carries a big price tag of $155 , plus whatever shipping costs are involved. (Image credit: Bethesda Softworks) For that, you get the 8-inch tall PVC statue of Victor the Securitron, plus a Vault Boy pin, psych eval cards, a Mojave Express patch, and NCR Recon patch. And yes, the game is in there too, although true old-timers may be disappointed: It's not a disc, but a download code for Fallout: New Vegas and its six expansions: Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Gun Runners' Arsenal, and Courier's Stash. My personal appreciation for swag aside, the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition is probably the bigger deal.

But if you're not a fan of this pad's Xbox-style asymmetric sticks and button glyphs, Razer has another 'don't worry, I've got you' offering. Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).

It's a little strange calling it the V3 Pro, because as far as I can tell there was no Raiju V2 or V2 Pro, just the original Raiju, plus an Ultimate and Tournament edition . Still, I suppose it makes sense to name it V3 Pro to keep it in-line with the Wolverine V3 Pro, given it looks like it's essentially the same controller but in symmetrical PlayStation layout. It works with and is at least in part designed for use with the PS5, of course, but also for PC. In fact, on PC it reaches up to 2,000 Hz polling, which is twice what you get with the Wolverine V3 Pro, but obviously less than what you get on the 8,000 Hz Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC.

Painkiller—intended as a reboot, I guess, hence coming to the table with the same unmodified name as the original—isn't a bad game, strictly speaking. I've only played the now-vanished demo that was available during the Steam Next Fest and so my thoughts are based strictly on that, but based on my time with it the new game seems like a reasonably competent, utterly unremarkable Doom-style co-op shooter. And it is co-op, whether you like it or not: Even if you choose to play offline, you'll be in the company of bots who spout various bits of bad exposition about who they are and how they came to be there, and in most situations will also quickly take care of all the combat for you if you let them. I tested this multiple times by simply standing in a corner after entering a new area. My bot bros struggled a bit with larger demons but otherwise cleaned house quickly, efficiently, and with no input from me. (Maybe I should've turned the difficulty up, bu…",

It'll power the supercomputers of the future, we're consistently told—eventually, once some pesky hurdles have been knocked out of the way. Well, Google has announced just that—a \"major algorithmic breakthrough\" that certainly seems like a hurdle tumbling away in the distance, thanks to the also-esoteric Quantum Echoes algorithm . Google claims it has achieved a verifiable quantum advantage by producing a result 13,000 times faster than a traditional supercomputer. Now I'm going to try and explain to you how it works, so strap in, folks. This might take a while, and I haven't even had my second coffee of the day. Bear with me. One of the major problems with quantum computers is the error rate, thanks to the fact that they use quantum bits, or qubits, as their fundamental unit of information. Unlike a regular bit, which can be a one or a zero, qubits can be one, zero, or a superposition in between. These qubits a…",

That was a hand-me-down, and I distinctly remember begging my mum for an Xbox 360 (then subsequently a second 360 when the first one got hit with a distinct maroon circle). I have (fond?) memories of playing on an Xbox 360 without its case and with the window open to stop it from overheating, and jamming things into the disk tray or banging the top to open it so I can pop in the new Call of Duty game. I even bought an Xbox Series X in 2020 against my better judgment, and it has been demoted to a device I use to access Xbox Game Pass every couple of months when something I really want hits the service. This is all to say, despite good memories of the Xbox brand, things have been going slowly downhill for my appreciation of it, and for the first time ever, I plan on skipping whatever Microsoft puts out next.

Players didn't like how currency gain slowed to a crawl (that has since been fixed ) and server woes were widely reported. But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely. That's a message that we keep on having to share with our community. It's not something where we'll receive zero percent cheating. \"But there is a goal for us to make sure that, again, if we stay ahead of cheating and we address it fas…",

He listed Tekken 1-5 as his \"most hated\" games and had public \"feuds\" with Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Devil May Cry's Hideki Kamiya. While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",
