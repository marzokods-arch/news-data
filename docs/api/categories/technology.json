That's basically the gist of what I had to deal with when diving into my first trip alongside fellow PCG writers Kara and Elie: a Peak-adjacent co-op adventure where—instead of climbing up treacherous mountains and fighting for survival—we're forced to haul a metal piece of crap over rocky terrain and down narrow winding paths to reach our destination.

I regularly found myself clipping out of the RV which almost spelled my death on a couple of occasions, items we'd packed along for the trip would randomly vanish, and I sometimes would end up defying gravity when grabbing the winch, leaving me floating around in mid-air.

But Nike, with the help of its robotics partner, Dephy , has created a system that augments lower leg and ankle movement via a lightweight-yet-powerful electric motor, attached to a drive belt and exoskeleton-like assembly.

This leaves the EU in a very difficult spot: it's so reliant on Chinese exports, yet some would have it spur up its own trade war in response. The European Commission is reportedly drawing up plans of what might be included in measures to counter China's rare earths controls, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg . Though what these might entail is not yet clear—EU leaders are cautious to spark any further action with an important trading partner if it can be avoided. Though there are groups pushing for punitive measures.

Either way, you'll be defending Arcadia from an oppressive regime and vicious megacorporation soon. My colleague Ted Litchfield has played it, and says it's \"a great RPG that surpasses its predecessor\" in his The Outer Worlds 2 review . I've been keen on trying it since Ted mentioned you can acquire \"Foot In Mouth Syndrome\" through its new Flaw System—a very real and totally relatable affliction I seem to have too. Feels nice to be seen. So for the sake of planning my schedule and yours, I've gone ahead and laid out The Outer Worlds 2 release times by timezone, and included a quick note on preloading.

Enter the Raiju V3 Pro , another wireless controller pitched towards the Esports scene but instead featuring symmetrical TMR sticks and PlayStation stylings. All for $220, which is $20 more than the latest iteration of the Wolverine. Sorry, what ? The TMR sticks contribute in part to that steep premium. For those unaware, the Hall effect is one magnetic tech that effectively banishes stick drift, and TMR (or tunnelling magnetoresistance) is another. The difference is that the way TMR leverages its electromagnetic sensors allows the controller's sticks to pick up really minute movements, making for a level of precision above even what the Hall effect can offer. Oh, and on the Raiju V3 Pro, you can swap in a long, long thumbstick topper for even more precise movement if that's your jam (though I'm not sure it's mine).

Still, I suppose it makes sense to name it V3 Pro to keep it in-line with the Wolverine V3 Pro, given it looks like it's essentially the same controller but in symmetrical PlayStation layout. It works with and is at least in part designed for use with the PS5, of course, but also for PC. In fact, on PC it reaches up to 2,000 Hz polling, which is twice what you get with the Wolverine V3 Pro, but obviously less than what you get on the 8,000 Hz Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC.
