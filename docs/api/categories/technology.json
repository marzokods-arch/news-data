That's not to mention the bizarre accusations being flung around from its co-CEOs. Former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies blamed the game's failure on \" internal and external saboteurs, \" a sentiment that had been echoed by Mark Gerhard just a couple of months prior when he popped off on Discord to claim that the negative reactions to the game were \"100%\" financed by someone .

    "body": "I always enjoy it when someone with great power decides to use it for great mischief, rather than great responsibility. As is the case of the hacker that wreaked havoc in Nexon's online RTS, Blue Archive, late last week. As spotted by Automaton , said hacker tapped into the game's systems to, and I am being fully serious, copy-paste the same anime girl over and over. Kurosaki Koyuki is a student players can obtain—a hacker prodigy with a mischievous streak. This event has been dubbed the \"Koyuki apocalypse\". Why did Blue Archive decide to bug out in the funnest way possible? The Koyuki apocalypse is real. pic.twitter.com/4Bzz3OBPV5 August 31, 2025 As shared by Jambo971 on X above, the hacker replaced recruitment banners with Koyuki, spawned a bunch of Koyukis in the game's cafes, and did this to the game's information page , replacing its title with \"Nihahaha\" (her laugh) and, you guessed it, more Koyukis. This prompted Nexon to pull Blue Archive offline for six entire hours, per this official notice , which reads: \"We sincerely apologize for the concern caused by the abnormal display of certain content on August 31 (Sun). The investigation into the situation has reached its final…",

    "body": "Marvel Rivals Season 4 continues the strong pace set by the previous season but adds some much-needed quality-of-life features, along with a few things I never knew I needed. Of course, we're getting two new heroes, maps, modes, events, and a fresh battle pass to grind through, too. Below, I'll go over all you need to know about Marvel Rivals Season 4 right now, including the release date and the latest news on new heroes and other content arriving in the next major update. Marvel Rivals Season 4 release date and time Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches on Friday, September 12, 2025 , after server downtime at 1 am PDT / 4 am EST / 9 am GMT, which coincides with the end of Season 3 (though the battle pass will stick around). The mid-season update, Season 4.5, should launch on or around Friday, October 10, 2025, just one month after the first half of the update. Honestly, I'm still not used to this faster pace, with full seasons lasting just two months. Here's everything new in Season 4: New heroes: Angela and Daredevil New map: K'un-Lun Heart of Heaven (Convergence mode) Arcade mode: Clone Rumble and Giant-Size Brain Blast are permanent modes Favourite heroes: You can now add heroes to…",

I'm willing to endure the most prickly parts of PoE 2 because the campaign is excellent—and it just got better. The latest update adds a new act that has me fully on board with Grinding Gear Games' vision for an action RPG campaign that might be as ambitious as the version of Diablo 2 that exists in people's memories. I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG …",

I’m deeply grateful for the creativity, dedication, and hard work of the teammates we are parting ways with.

Roblox said the new age estimation tech, combined with Roblox's existing ID verification and parental consent tools, \"will provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account.\" The company also plans on rolling out new systems that will restrict communications between adults and minors unless they know each other in real life. \"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content,\" Roblox said in an update . \"We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow.\" Roblox's facial age estimation works by analyzing a selfie to estimate your age and sort you into a rating group—under 13, 13+, or 18+—with varying restrictions for each category.
