The list of permanent updates Blizzard plans to implement in its next season bring foundational reworks to loot and combat that will trickle down into the rest of the game. All of it will be on the PTR next week to test out, but so far it seems like Diablo 4 is about to become a tougher but more satisfying action RPG. Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back. The change with the most impact—and the most risk of under-delivering—is with combat. Blizzard says monster behavior was “too predictable,” in a draft of a blog post it provided to PC Gamer, and that it’s tweaking things to give each demon a stronger identity. On paper, this sounds like Diablo 4 combat might actually require some target priority, like taking care of a caster in the backline before the tank in the front. I’ve mindlessly torn through enough dungeons in the last few years to be a little skeptical about how much this will shift the feel of combat when your character is fully geared, but it sounds promising.

By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",

A slight fall at the first hurdle, that, as I'd imagine many beginners wouldn't know the difference between the two. Or even what \"CPU\" might stand for, for that matter. Playing dumb, however, and asking which was faster, resulted in a surprisingly measured response. \"For 4K gaming specifically, both AMD and Intel’s latest high-end CPUs perform excellently!\" said the AI. \"At 4K resolution, your graphics card becomes the primary performance factor rather than the CPU, so the difference between top-tier AMD and Intel processors is minimal in most 4K gaming sc…",

And early leaked benchmarks of the chip suggest the new M5 is about twice as fast as the original M1 for single-thread performance. So, the question is, why can't PC CPUs make those kinds of gains? The immediate context here is the accuracy of the leaked benchmark and the actual performance gains of PC processors over the same time period. So, first off, the leaked numbers look plausible. That's because the M4 already had very high single-thread performance and the M5 leaked numbers look to have pushed that on 10% to 15% depending on which precise Apple platforms you are comparing. Now you might dismiss 10% to 15% as your usual generational gain similar to PC chips. And it is. Except Apple is iterating on a nearly annual basis, with the M1 launching in November 2020 and the M5 now with us in late 2025. Intel and AMD tend to take two years to release major new architectures. That more rapid Apple cadence adds up pretty fast as the years tick by. How fast?

Although its brief reveal trailer welcomed us to the new setting, there's now more than enough information for us to sink our teeth into ahead of its release. We already knew Tinkerbell and Snow White would be a part of the DLC as they were shown in the original trailer, but Tigger and Cruella de Vil will now be joining us too. Both will play a significant part in the story, with Cruella essentially taking the role of the villain having left the ranch to decay over time. Tigger, however, will be lost somewhere amongst the new biomes of the map and it will be our job to find him. Unlike the Storybook Vale DLC, Wishblossom Ranch won't be split into parts either so you'll be able to unlock all the characters from day one. Two new horses have also been showcased. Maximus from Tangled was featured in the reveal, but Khan from Mulan and Pegasus from Hercules are coming as well. All three will have friendship goals like normal characters, and each has a spec…",

See, present-day Minecraft has a few core principles. The relevant ones to everyone's least favourite critter are \"be fair to players\", \"bad things can happen, but they're technically the player's fault\", \"find the right level of destruction\", and \"don't add features that wreck player's builds.\" If you're sitting here thinking 'hey, wait a second, those are all things that the Creeper does!' then you'd be right. As Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten says in the video linked above, \"If you followed the rules we have today, you would probably not add the creeper, because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster that would show up and just destroy what you built.\" However, the \"creeper is very iconic\", which seems in direct conflict with all those lovely pre-established rules.

The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing. Instead, the proportion of AI-generated articles has remained relatively stable over the last 12 months.

It can feel like running through treacle trying to rank up, level weapons for attachments, and perhaps most painful of all, to complete the many arduous assignments—not helped by a prominent bug causing assignments not to track . Whether through fear of players unlocking everything right away and getting bored, or in an effort to curtail those who would inevitably use Portal as an XP farm , it's not working out well for anyone. Portal servers totally aren't inundated with private bot matches to cheese progression to the point that this creative mode isn't actually serving its purpose.

The Winter Ball will bring Cinderella to the game, one of the characters players have been desperate to invite to their valley since it launched. Even though the roster gets bigger every single year, there's still a pretty significant lack of original princesses, so having updates like this one is always exciting, even though we've still got a couple of months to wait before we get to meet her.

Much of that arises from the perceived likelihood of a less-than-ideal long-term outcome for EA, its creative output, and its staff—but some elements of the US government are also uncertain about the whole thing for different reasons: In a letter to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren expressed \" profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks \" that could result from the takeover. \"The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF's reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government,\" the letter states, all but explicitly pointing the finger at longstanding allegations of \"sportswashing\" being conducted by Saudi Arabia via millions of dollars invested in sports, videogames, and \"other cultural institutions.\" Arguing that these deals aren't just about money, \"they are about influence,\" the senators also n…",

I was skeptical: I feel like I've had my fill of games that kinda sorta look like Minecraft but aren't actually Minecraft, y'know? But my skepticism evaporated roughly 35 seconds into the demo. I spawned on top of a small castle and picked up some sticks and planks that were lying around, which told me there was crafting. I descended a level and battled some skeletons, so hey, there's monsters. I quickly found a forge, so there's smithing, and a cauldron, so there's cooking. Within a couple minutes I had a magic sword that did poison damage, some armor (wooden, but better than nothing), a shield I'd crafted myself, a couple of potions, a bowl of mushroom stew, and a key to unlock a chest full of loot. That's a promising start. And outside the castle I found my first little airship, so there's flying, too. Explore a world dotted with islands (both in the ocean and hovering high above it), battle monsters, gain skills, craft weapons and armor, and build a mobile base on a flying ship? Everwind is checking a heck of a lot of boxes for me. Combat is very Skyrim-ish, and yeah, I mean that in a good way—there's a l…",

I'm talking your Lara Crofts, your Bushido Blades (alright, maybe that gorefest was a little mature): Games that demanded absolute precision from you, otherwise you'd be cut down in an instant or slowly leap to your doom. Let me tell you, Motorslice has me full-on-Ratatouille flashbacking back to those more innocent days. Except now I know how to play videogames. Allegedly. Motorslice's demo has been out for a while now, but it was recently updated for Steam Next Fest . Its controls seem unwieldy at first, but they're mostly just demanding. Chainsaw-blade-wielding protagonist P controls a lot like Lara Croft in the early Tomb Raider games. That is to say, all of her movements are incredibly high-commitment, and you need to know exactly where you're going. That's not to say the game's controls are perfect, yet.

When said lawyer opposed the claims, they were then accused of defending their use of AI with, well, AI (via 404 Media ). Or, to put it more succinctly, in the words of judge Joel Coehn: \"Counsel relied upon unvetted AI—in his telling, via inadequately supervised colleagues—to defend his use of unvetted AI.\" The case itself involved a dispute between family members and a defaulted loan, usually a relatively straightforward proceeding. However, once the plaintiff brought to the court's attention the apparently AI-generated citations and quotes in the defense counsel's brief, the defense claimed that \"these passages were intended as paraphrases or summarized statements of the legal principles established in the cited authorities.\" The judge points out that the purported paraphrases included \"bracketed terms to indicate departure from a quotation (not something one would expect to see in an intended paraphrase) and comments such a…",

This might make you consider upgrading to Windows 11 because, well, this will be the very last time you'll be able to get a security update like this unless you get Extended Security Updates for a year (via Bleeping Computer ). Thankfully this isn't too difficult, though, as if you're logged into your Microsoft account and syncing your settings, you can opt-in for free via your Windows Settings. This patch applies regardless, though. The latest patch includes fixes for zero-day exploits including privilege escalation, secure boot bypass, memory corruption, and TPM information retrieval. 'Zero-day' means these exploits were discovered and exploitable before there was a fix released for them, meaning systems have been vulnerable to these ones until now. Zero-days can be particularly scary, with devs scrambling to find a fix for them before users (or too many users) become affected by …",
