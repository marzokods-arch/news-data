I've been there before, crossing the creek in Dam Battlegrounds ahead of my group, I failed to look both ways before heading towards the Red Lakes Balcony Lift and ended up getting swarmed by a Snitch and a horde of Hornets. Needless to say, I choked and got downed by this gaggle of arcs. My team couldn't get to me in time, and I lost everything, including some items I needed for quests, what a gut punch.

Having recently completed Fantasy Finds, I was impressed at the sheer breadth of content and the incorporation of light RPG mechanics that let me live my best Baldur's Gate life in a museum. But, I was a little dubious when the Zooseum DLC was announced—this could be its own game, no? It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

On the whole, it's a pretty straightforward quest all centered in and around Red Tower, so here's how to complete it and overcome those trickier stages, like finding the missing battery cell and the antenna terminal. Find the missing battery cell and power up the generator The battery is located in a box to the northeast of Red Tower (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you'll need to head to the Red Tower location in the south of the Buried City, where you'll then be asked to \"Find the missing battery cell\".

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Having the best guns in Arc Raiders is helpful and all, but I'd say knowing your surroundings is actually more important to your success. Can you quickly retreat to a safe location without having to check your map and waste precious seconds? Do you know where locked rooms are? Where's the best place to ambush roaming raiders? How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part. Nevertheless, that's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you various named locations across Arc Raiders' five maps, and all you need to do is enter the correct name. And that's the official in-game name, not any shorthand versions. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to use named locations marked on your map . While some are outside, none are in random parts of the map.

While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format. Previously, players only had broad control over an encounter, able to select enemies they wanted to fight, dictate number of times enemies would respawn and choose whether or not to set a time limit or to s…",

A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post .
