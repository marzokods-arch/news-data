Depending on who you ask it may not even be Obsidian's best game this year—at least one PCG editor thinks it was Grounded 2 , and I almost couldn't choose between it and Avowed. It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions. Otherwise, KotOR 2, Mask of the Betrayer, New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, Tyranny, and Deadfire are all games that took years to achieve cult classic status, let alone the couple that have finally become universally acknowledged classics.

Subgenre trends happen all over gaming (the battle royale to extraction shooter pipeline, for instance) and cozy games are no exception. For a few years after Stardew Valley, absolutely everyone was making a farm sim. Then there was the influx of Townscaper-chasing cozy building games . This year it was the desktop idlers. (Image credit: Mister Morris Games, CaveLiquid, Moczan) They've got their roots back in the early 2000s when desktop pets were novelty applications that ran from your system tray in the bottom right. Back then, they were pretty minimal little apps that ran some simple animations and you could maybe have a couple interactions with. Desktop pets have completely evolved for their 2025 rebirth.

It seems like players are eager to embrace the new order, as two decidedly chill games dominated the sales charts around Christmas: Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6. That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat.

But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course. When it's all working as intended, Quality or Balanced upscaling at most resolutions does an incredible job, and I always enable it in every game that supports the most recent versions. Alas, I c…",

    "body": "If there's a single throughline for the PC gaming year that was 2025, it's finally accepting that the pursuit of fancy graphics just doesn't make sense anymore. Tech has hit a hard graphics plateau: raw generational updates are now nuanced upgrades measured in single-digit frame gains rather than evolutions anyone with eyes can appreciate, and the subsequent pivot to AI-generated frames and experimental hair follicles aren't really revving anyone's engines when those upgrades cost a month's rent. Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby. A bright spot of 2025 was the continued rise of \"friendslop,\" a cringey internet-spawned label for a broad genre of cooperative games designed for groups of friends. Peak and REPO were the big hits this calendar year, but they're of a kind with Phasmophobia and Lethal Company—all were among the best-selling Steam games of their release years, and it's no coincidence that they'll all run on a budget PC from nine years ago.

When players finally departed Oninoshima, Chapter 6's map, it was a sloppy soup of disconnected ideas, with First Order bases straddling bug-fighting military outposts and buildings from feudal Japan. I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons.

I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills.

And at least they're apologising for the fact the company has been unable to give me any kind of reliable pricing about the different versions of its GPU I've been testing. There have been no reference cards for AMD's new RDNA 4 architecture, and so I've got a selection of different options—all with different price tags—in front of me to base my effectively definitive review of what is actually the best AMD GPU in many a long year.

    "body": "Low-poly art has definitely been getting more popular over the last few years, which I only realised after a few of my friends started getting low-poly video game character tattoos. But with that said, the vast majority of the low-poly art I've seen has been digital. There's nothing wrong with that, and I've loved scrolling through endless works from a huge variety of talented creators. However, the moment I laid eyes on the work of Lasher , a UK-based oil pastel artist, I knew I was in for a treat. The first piece I found from Lasher was a low-poly Chao which popped up on my TikTok feed, which I immediately fell in love with. The second I played Sonic Adventure DX on my family PC back in 2004, I became slightly obsessed with these little creatures and each time I see them in any form, be it digital or physical art, clothing, or even something as simple as plushies and figures, I form an instant connection with it.

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . We try pretty hard to avoid lazily dropping cliches into our writing here at PC Gamer, which puts me in an awkward position as I sit down to pitch to you why a remaster, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black , is one of the best games of 2025, despite mostly being a fresh Unreal Engine 5 skin for a game that came out in 2008. So if I must sin, I may as well see just how many forbidden phrases from the style guide I can use at once. 2025's brand new Ninja Gaiden 4, despite being a visceral action romp with more bloody decapitations than you can shake a stick at, is ultimately a bit of a mixed bag . At its core is a pulse-pounding combat system that echoes the greats of yesteryear, but it's rough around the edges. Fans of the genre will still find a lot to like, but at the end of the day it's not without flaws. If you turn off your brain you'll get a kick out of PlatinumGames' no-holds-barred attempt to make Ninja Gaiden c…",

I think 2025 was one of the best detective game years ever, if not the best.

That glimpse, created over two weeks by an ILM artist, was Star Wars: Field Guide : a two-minute fizzle reel of AI-generated blue lions, tentacled walruses, turtles with alligator heads, and zebra-stripe chimpanzees, all lazily spliced together from the shuffled bits of normal-ass animals. These \"aliens\" were less Star Wars than they were Barnum & Bailey. It felt like a singular embarrassment: Instead of showing its potential, generative AI just demonstrated how out of touch a major media force had become. And then it kept happening. At the time, I wondered whether evoking the legacy of Lucasfilm just to declare creative bankruptcy had provoked enough disgusted responses to convince Disney to slow its roll on AI ventures…",

That should have been thanks to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X CPU , which looked very promising at launch and ought to have been getting into its stride this year. That clearly hasn't happened. And yet there are several unambiguous signs that the Arm revolution on the PC may well be imminent. Yes, for real this time. What's more, modern Arm CPUs look very compelling on paper. When it comes to single-core performance, all the indications are that they are actually superior to x86. And single-core performance is particularly important for gaming. Anyway, if the Snapdragon X has been a disappointment, that's perhaps as much down to unrealistic expectations as it is any failings of Snapdragon X or Arm CPUs more generally. In other words, if Arm is to take a big chunk of the PC market, or even overtake x86, that is never going to happen overnight.
