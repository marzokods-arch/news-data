    "body": "If you've got good taste (read: the exact same taste as me), Tim Cain bears a lot of responsibility for some of your favourite games ever. His name is on the original Fallouts, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, and plenty else besides. Alas, he's been in a state of semi-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, but otherwise contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote. So I'm not a contractor anymore.\" What's he working on? Well, wouldn't you like to know? Cain's not tel…",

Fair's fair: it's a pretty limited pool of stuff. So limited, in fact, that it makes me wonder why use AI for it in the first place. In terms of the game's background art, Supertrick says AI was used after the devs \"developed the concepts and text, ensuring they matched the game’s world setting. Based on these ideas, the art team designed the background art and used an AI tool that observes copyright laws and only to generate rough base images, which were painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand.\" Supertrick says it used this approach for \"select posters in the background, select insert images used in the InfoCast, [and] select images used in the reading materials.\" As for voice…",

The method I used was similar to the one YouTuber ManyATrueNerd used to work out what level Lucy got to by the end of the first season, with a couple of tweaks. First off, as Lucy is the main character, most of the groundwork is based on her.

The 25 Most Wanted PC games for 2026 #25: Reanimal (Image credit: Tarsier Studios) Developer: Tarsier Studios | Release Date : TBD From the makers of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 comes another co-op horror game, and this one's even more unnerving than its predecessors. In Reanimal, a young brother and sister return to the island they were raised on, only now it's infested by horrifying chimera hellbent on chasing them through every decrepit corner of what once was home. #24: Grave Seasons Developer: Perfect Garbage | Release Date : 2026 Grave Seasons is a farming sim with a supernatural twist.

Honestly, it makes me want to quit my job right now, but my student loans won't pay themselves. It's a similar premise to Stardew Valley, but this trailer shows just how much Starsand Island emphasizes the DIY building aspect of the upcoming game. You can construct your own greenhouses, tailoring their shape and size to your wishes, and build your dream home. It's the complete package for those of you that dream of starting a new life in a quaint little town. You can also get stuck into the farming, though. There are plenty of crops to plant, including giant watermelons. They're my favourite fruit, so you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be growing as many as I can.

Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Regions of Ruin: Runegate on Steam We already had visuals on the many, many weapon types available in the game—great axes and spears, daggers, longswords, scimitars—but I hadn't spotted the potential to play with flaming crossbows until now. Who needs to get up close and personal when you can just set light to your foes from afar? This is a game not only about smacking goblins around with firebolts, but also rebuilding a home for your people and keeping it safe. The trailer hints at the expansive structures you'll have a chance to construct, with a wide shot of a grand Dwarven staircase leading to gods-know-where.

Download the demo Download the Luna Abyss demo on Steam The new trailer is a tension-ratcheting mood piece that gives us a better look at the world, enemy design, gunplay, and movement. The camera pans across labyrinthine pipework and imposing gothic structures silhouetted by throbbing red neon. It's industrial, alien, and dystopian in equal measure. We get small snippets of the creatures that inhabit this world: fleshy, twisted patchworks of metal and skin that seem to leer at us like they're possessed. It's proper nightmare fuel, the kind of monsters dreamt up by Giger or Beksiński, or that nasty neighbour kid from Toy Story. Scene set, and it's onto the action.

Developed by Afrime Studios—a majority black-owned developer with a specific goal to \"tell their story their way\"—Unyverse marries ancient tradition inspired by African cultures with advanced sci-fi tech. Quadrupedal robots stalk the perimeter of a savannah outpost, geodesic dwellings dotting the background with traditional patterns adorning their domes. Later on, we see grand hallways lined with towering statues, then desert monuments sat beneath huge waterfalls, only to cut to a sleek bar that wouldn't look out of place in Cyberpunk 2077 .
