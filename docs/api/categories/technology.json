    "body": "TL;DR The Google app’s voice search interface has been updated with a new look. This new appearance is more in line with Gemini and Search AI Mode. The update is live for some users across multiple versions of the Google app. The Google app is getting a visual update that gives it kind of a Gemini vibe. A new look is rolling out to the voice search interface accessible from microphone icons throughout the Google app, bringing softly glowing colors that look a lot like what you’ll see in Gemini and Google’s AI Mode. As spotted by 9to5Google , an updated visual theme rolling out to the Google app’s voice search replaces the old Google Assistant-style four-dot animation with a new horizon-shaped bar that glows with the same colors you’ll see when interacting with Google’s other modern voice-search interfaces. We first saw these changes coming in September , and they’re now reaching users in the wild.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus might finally fix the disappointing aspect of its flagships. It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

Set to take place on April 18 at Point Malcolm Reserve in Semaphore, Adelaide, the festival is being presented in partnership with Chugg Music and supported by the South Australian Government and City of Charles Sturt. According to organisers, Lime Green is being developed as a 100% off-grid event, with the goal of significantly reducing the environmental footprint typically associated with large-scale live music festivals. Lime Cordiale brothers Oli and Louis Leimbach said the project emerged from years of questioning the environmental impact of touring and live events. “From the accelerating loss of polar ice to the devastating algal blooms currently choking the South Australian coast, it is impossible to ignore that our climate is at a breaking point,” the duo said in a statement. “For the last five years, we’ve wrestled with a deep, personal dilemma as environmentalists: Is our touring contributing to the problem?

Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development.

Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",

The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing.

Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices. The request comes in a letter (h/t The Verge ) from 11 Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Garcia. It focuses on Trump Mobile’s still-unreleased T1 Phone, announced more than six months ago and still accepting deposits despite not yet shipping anything to customers.",

This year, that moment came courtesy of Razer and its latest experiment in AI companionship, Project Ava. It’s an AI-powered gaming assistant designed to sit on your desk, analyze what’s happening on-screen, and offer real-time advice. It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device. But it’s your opinion we care most about, so we put a poll in Joe’s article asking if you’d consider buying Project Ava.",
