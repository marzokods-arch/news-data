And Ferocious, which has just launched on Steam during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, wins bonus points for piling mechsuits, Tarkov-like weapon modifications, and dino-taming into the mix. Never settle for less. Get it now Buy Ferocious on Steam Its launch trailer showcases a toybox of ideas that rivals Far Cry in scope, but there's a dark and moody atmosphere here that runs counter to that series' recently dialled up mayhem. Prehistoric monsters stalk their prey through suffocatingly dense jungle environments, rain lashing down through breaks in the canopy—and when you can find relief from the downpour you're greeted by armies of heavily armed, shadowy mercs. But there absolutely is a power fantasy here, as seconds later we're taming T-Rexes, strapping into mechsuits, and using high-powered scopes to pick off unwitting bad guys from on high. And yes, you can ride the dinosaurs—or at least the big ones, I'm highly doubtful you can take flight on Pterodactyls, or careen through foliage atop a knee-high Compy. It also looks like you'll be able to direct the dinos both through …",

Its latest trailer, debuted at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, highlights exactly how your squad can carefully clear—or brainlessly blunder—through its merc-filled locales. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Rogue Point on Steam The trailer centres on a montage of the tactical tools at your team’s disposal, while underlining that you can always default to a good old-fashioned, guns-blazing shootout should a squadmate fumble the ball. SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six vets can get misty-eyed over the inclusion of a snake cam, which you can slide under doors to see what the enemy mercs are up to. There's also a neat pre-match planning board where your team can draw up attacking routes for efficiently sweeping through the building, or you know, just doodle and hope for the best. There are hostages to rescue, bombs to defuse, but the tone is much lighter than the typically po-faced milsim machismo of other tactical shooters. Case in point, you can spend in-gam…",

It's a vision of the future in which humanity has begun to colonise the solar system, but the culture has remained that of feudal Japan's. You step into the cyborg shoes of Yuzuki, the heir of a once-powerful family that was wiped out by a rival clan. She's on a quest for revenge and has undertaken secretive genetic engineering to transform herself into a samurai capable of surviving on the harsh lunar landscape. You'll slice your way through other samurai and huge robotic bosses, all set to a banging J-rock soundtrack. Music is core to SOL Shogunate, with enemy actions synced up to the tunes, but it's not a rhythm game—you're free to attack however you like.

The promise came in a filing made on December 1 (via The Game Post ), the latest step in the legal tussle between Tencent and Sony. Sony filed suit against Tencent earlier this year over Light of Motiram, a game revealed in late 2024 that looked a lot like Horizon Zero Dawn ; Sony took that characterization a step further in its lawsuit, calling Light of Motiram a \"slavish clone\" of the Horizon games. Tencent responded by purging the most egregious Horizon-like content from Light of Motiram's Steam page and bumping the release date from late 2025 to Q4 2027—a massive two-year delay, suggesting that Tencent figured it was going to get hammered if it didn't dramatically overhaul the game.

While the championship has experimented with wrestler-style intros before, in which competitors run down a tunnel to a smattering of muted applause from the Las Vegas crowd, this year, they've gone full \"let's get ready to ruuuuuuumbblllleeeeeee.\" \"I feel like we need to get [inaudible] more pumped up in here\" screamed one of the hosts mid-way through a competitor intro sequence, her voice audibly breaking with excitement. \"From the United States of America,\" the other interjects. \"Let's give it up for... Peeeeeter Scharl!\" Enter Scharl, merrily running down a neon lit tunnel holding a sign saying \"I love to merge cells\". The crowd boos, because, according to my data-science-au-fait partner, merging cells breaks a lot of Excel functions.

In particular, there are very reasonable concerns that the AI industry might be a bubble that's getting ready to pop. One person who isn't quite so pessimistic, though, is the CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna. Krishna recently spoke with Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, on the Decoder podcast and sounded optimistic about the future of AI—which is, to my ears at least, quite refreshing, even if I don't agree on all points. In particular, although he does explicitly say \"no\", we're not in an AI bubble, his explanation, at least on my listening, doesn't seem to completely rule out this possibility; rather, it explains how such things aren't all-or-nothing. I say this is \"refreshing\" just because of how one-dimensional a lot of AI talk can be: either 'AI sucks and the bubble's going to burst' or 'AI is an amazing innovation that will revolutionise everything.' The IBM CEO's perspective, however, injects what I think is a little more nuance and realism into the debate, by reminding us of a very simple fact: in industry, there are often some winners and many…",

So you might think it's good news that SK hynix is said to be investing over half a trillion dollars in building new RAM factories, but the reality is that it won't make a jot of difference to the current crisis. In any other year by 2025, news that a memory company is apparently investing approximately $540 billion in the construction of four new manufacturing plants would be viewed with shock and suspicion. That's because such a sum of money is way more than the typical cost of that many RAM foundries. And yet, this is exactly what SK hynix is doing, according to a report from the Seoul Economic Daily (via Jukan on X ). With approximately 35% of the DRAM market , SK hynix is second only to Samsung, and over the past 12 months, it's been steadily eating away at its South Korean rival's lead. Neither company, though, are in a position where they can produce enough RAM to satisfy every demand. Put simply, it's all down to the astonishing growth of the AI server market. These immense data centers require huge amounts of system RAM and spe…",

I recently got the chance to talk to Nolan, and I asked him if he played Fallout: New Vegas as much as he'd played Fallout 3. \"I didn't play it when it came out,\" Nolan said. \"I played it more recently when I knew we were going to Vegas. Actually, that's not true. I played a little bit when it came out, but I went back and dug in a little more when I knew that Vegas was on the horizon. And it's a terrific game.\" I asked if I could pin him down on which game he preferred, Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. \"Fallout 3,\" he said with not even a microsecond's hesitation—which may cause some Fallout fans to gnash their teeth since New Vegas is overwhelmingly regarded as the high-water mark of the Fallout games (or at least of the Bethesda-published Fallout games). \"Fallout 3 is where the journey for me started.
