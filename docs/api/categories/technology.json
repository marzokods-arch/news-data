You have to respect it; that's years of holding out for improvements to the new OS before finally taking the plunge. The latest Steam Hardware Survey is out now , and in it we can see that the share of users on Windows 11 has increased by 2.65%. Windows 11 is run by 63.04% of those surveyed, up from 60.39% last month. Windows 10, on the other hand, has dropped by 2.9%. You'll notice that's not the same number of users that have jumped to Windows 11, which maybe would suggest some have switched to other OS platforms, primarily Linux, for their gaming machines. However, Linux only saw a small 0.04% increase in the past month, so that's not exactly popping off. It's more likely we're just seeing the imperfect methods of the Steam Hardware Survey. The survey is far from a perfect representation of the userbase of Valve's platform—it's more akin to \"guidelines\" than actual data, to loosely quote Captain Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean. Still, it's a good idea of what the general trends among users are. Of the many Linux distributions, it's Arch that has the lar…",

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock. But public companies have their disadvantages, too—particularly for consumers in creative and entertainment industries. Shareholder primacy, the theory that deliveri…",

So I was pretty interested in Hotel Barcelona, a 2.5D action roguelite that emerged—like Athena from Zeus' skull—from a hot collabo between the two creators. And then I stopped being quite so interested: reviews weren't great—the game currently stands at a 56% Mixed user rating on Steam, and critics weren't in love with it either. Now, in another blow to my interest Hotel Barcelona has updated its Steam page to feature an AI disclaimer. The disclaimer bashfully admits that \"VHS tapes can be found in the late stages of the game that use voice overs from an AI text to speech service\" and that \"A logo is featured on these tapes that has utilised generative fill AI to complete the image.\" In an update published earlier today , Hotel Barcelona publisher CULT seemed pretty abashed by the wh…",

With the likes of TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor fabrication company) being based there, it's right at the centre of the global chip trade. With America also looking to regain a slice of that technological pie, that has led to some chatter about potential deals between the two countries. As reported by Reuters , US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told News Nation (a US-based television network) that it would be proposing a 50/50 split with Taiwan for future chip production. In this, the US government wants Taiwan to move 50% of the chips it produces for US use to be made in the US. TSMC has fabs in America, newly-built ones with plans for more, but they don't make up anywhere near as much of global production as its facilities in Taiwan. This proposed deal would try to push for commitment to a huge increase in production on US soil. Cheng Li-chiun, a Taiwanese politician and vice premier, told reporters, \"Our negotiating team has never made any commitment to a 50/50 split on chips.

The trailer in question was itself made entirely in Sora 2, situating Altman in an AI-generated studio, an impossible neon-coloured forest, and even an oversized duck racing event. However, the most popular AI-generated clip on the Sora app right now is reportedly a fabricated surveillance video showing Sam Altman stealing graphics cards, according to OpenAI researcher Gabriel Petersson . The latest Sora model launched today alongside a dedicated app , with its key social pitch being features that allow you to remix your friends' creations and upload your own likeness into AI-generated videos. Altman claims there are in-app mitigations against the misuse of someone's likeness.

The clip (embedded above) shows Call of Duty pro Simp using one of Blops 7's new killstreak rewards, The Gravemaker, a sniper rifle whose wielder can see, and snipe, through solid walls. The go-to joke is that Activision has given up on combating cheaters and decided to just put wallhacking into the game. I sort of get the indignation, because it doesn't look fun to be on the receiving end of a bullet that was fired through two layers of concrete by someone you never could've seen, but I also sort of don't get it, because aren't all Call of Duty killstreaks like that? How is this less fair than someone calling in an attack helicopter or carpet bombing part of the map? In some of these games you can call in a tactical nuke. A nuclear bomb!

    "summary": "Andrzej Sapkowski returns to the series he said he was done with once again, this time for a prequel.",
    "body": "No good deed goes unpunished in the cynical world of The Witcher. Crossroads of Ravens opens with our young hero, Geralt not-yet-of-Rivia, about to be punished for the crime of rescuing a peasant father and daughter. Multiple authorities take him to task for daring to play hero, all for entirely self-serving reasons, until an older witcher named Preston Holt steps in to save Geralt and position himself as the boy's new mentor. Crossroads of Ravens begins as it means to go on. Chapter two opens with a description of a peasant standing in fresh cowshit to keep his feet warm. It's a book about the mud and muck of its medieval world, one that jams its characters into moral quagmires as well as physical ones. It's a prequel to the Witcher series, set shortly after Geralt finishes his training at the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen under Vesemir and is let loose into the world. He's like a fresh-faced graduate right out of the education system suddenly having to deal with an adult world he isn't prepared for. Will he have to move into a moldy sharehouse and get a part-time job? Well, no. But he is going to meet a semi-retired senior witcher and be offered a mixture of post-graduate tr…",

    "body": "The first tease for The Witcher 4 , back in 2022, was nothing but an image of a snow-covered Witcher medallion—but not a wolf. That led to an immediate question: Which school did it represent ? There are several in the world of The Witcher, after all: Geralt's School of the Wolf is the one we know best, but there are also schools dedicated to the Viper, the Bear, the Manticore, and others, each with different attitudes and approaches to their profession. That's true of the games, anyway, but apparently it's not the case in the books they're based on. In a new AMA on Reddit , Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski said the whole idea of individual Witcher schools is based on a mistake, and it hasn't gone away because \"videogame people\" won't let it go. \"A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish,\" Sapkowski explained. \"I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. \"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly videogame people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tena…",

    "body": "Cairn made quite a splash when it debuted at the Summer Game Fest in 2024: PC Gamer's Mollie Taylor said that despite her distaste for \"verticality,\" the reveal trailer left her with an immediate urge to grab a carabiner and go climbing . She's going to have to wait a bit to embark on that particular adventure, though, as developer The Game Bakers announced today that instead of arriving on November 5 as planned, Cairn needs a little more time in the oven and will show up in early 2026 instead . The game is \"content complete,\" The Game Bakers clarified, but developers want to take a few extra weeks \"to focus on optimization, debug, and polish.\" \"Our goal has always been to create games you remember long after playing them, and for Cairn, despite our best efforts, this requires a little more time,\" the studio wrote. \"We've been running a lot of playtests, and you've let us know that we have something truly special with Cairn. Still, we also see the improvements we can still make to give you the best game we can. After five years of work, so close to our goal, we don't want to rush it.\" Delays suck (although not as much as a bad game ), but it's probably a good move if The Game Bake…",
