Large swathes of the US were blanketed in snow and ice over the weekend, and what better way to spend a snow day than going down a YouTube rabbit hole? Everyone has their favorite oddity: ASMR , jazzy pop song covers , cooking channels , or what have you. But DIY enthusiasts in particular are missing out if they're not watching Drain Cleaning Australia , featuring an Australian plumber known only as Bruce as he goes about his daily business of shooting high-powered water jets into stubborn clogged drainage systems. It's \"the YouTube channel you never knew you needed.\" And it's done so well that he's now launched a second channel, Bruce the Plumber . I stumbled upon the Drain Cleaning Australia channel via Amy Poehler 's Good Hang podcast episode with Kate McKinnon, who is a big fan and does a dead-on delivery of Bruce's trademark lines (\"You little rippah!\"). Bruce never appears in his videos, apart from his hands and the occasional shadow as he films various challenging jobs with his intrepid smartphone.

Case in point: AI Overviews. This AI-powered search experience has a reputation for getting things wrong, but you may notice some improvements soon. Google says AI Overviews is being upgraded to the latest Gemini 3 models with a more conversational bent. In just the last year, Google has radically expanded the number of searches on which you get an AI Overview at the top. Today, the chatbot will almost always have an answer for your query, which has relied mostly on models in Google's Gemini 2.5 family. There was nothing wrong with Gemini 2.5 as generative AI models go, but Gemini 3 is a little better by every metric. There are, of course, multiple versions of Gemini 3, and Google doesn't like to be specific about which ones appear in your searches. What Google does say is that AI Overviews chooses the right model for the job.

The EX60 is built on Volvo’s new SPA3 platform, made only for battery-electric vehicles.

Mega casting reduces the number of parts of the rear floor from 100-plus to one piece crafted of aluminum alloy, reducing complexities and weld points.

    "body": "When Apple stops supporting older iPhones and iPads with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, it usually isn't the end of the line—Apple keeps releasing new security-only patches for those devices for another year or two, keeping them usable while their hardware is still reasonably capable. Once those updates dry up, it's rare for Apple to revisit those older operating systems, but the company does sometimes make exceptions. That was the case yesterday, when the company released a batch of updates for long-retired iOS and iPadOS versions that otherwise hadn't seen a new patch in months or years. Those updates include iOS 12.5.8, available for devices as old as 2013's iPhone 5S and 2014's iPhone 6; iOS 15.8.6, available for devices like the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPad Air 2; and iOS 16.7.13, available for devices like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Both iOS 15 and iOS 16 were last patched in mid-2025, but iOS 12's last patch was released in January 2023. Read full article Comments",

After Formula 1, these are some of the most complex, sophisticated race cars ever to turn a wheel—and it doesn't hurt that they look extremely cool, too. But yet again, endurance racing wants to offer more than just entertainment. A large number of automotive technologies or safety features that we mostly take for granted today made their way into road cars from the race track . Seatbelts, rear-view mirrors, turbocharged engines, aerodynamics, direct-injection engines, dual-clutch gearboxes, and more owe their existence to competition.

    "body": "For close to a century, geoscientists have pondered a mystery: Where did Earth’s lighter elements go? Compared to amounts in the Sun and in some meteorites, Earth has less hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, as well as noble gases like helium—in some cases, more than 99 percent less. Some of the disparity is explained by losses to the solar system as our planet formed. But researchers have long suspected that something else was going on too. Recently, a team of scientists reported a possible explanation—that the elements are hiding deep in the solid inner core of Earth. At its super-high pressure—360 gigapascals, 3.6 million times atmospheric pressure—the iron there behaves strangely, becoming an electride: a little-known form of the metal that can suck up lighter elements.

The timing of OpenAI's post details the design philosophy behind Codex just as AI agents are becoming more practical tools for everyday work. These tools aren't perfect and remain controversial for some software developers. While OpenAI has previously told Ars Technica that it uses Codex as a coding tool to help develop the Codex product itself, we also discovered , through hands-on experience, that these tools can be astonishingly fast at simple tasks but remain brittle beyond their training data and require human oversight for production work.

Under the RFC2606 —an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn't obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org. Misconfig gone, but is it fixed?

The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place. This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it's stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.

And Microsoft complied with the FBI's request. BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually, during the Windows 8 era Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft's servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don't lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too. A Microsoft rep said that the company handled \"around 20\" similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these r…",

As previously reported , the first attempt at a Super Mario movie adaptation in 1993 was notoriously a dismal failure , although it still has its ’90s-nostalgic fans. But 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie won over gaming fans who were skeptical about another adaptation— including Ars Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland. The 2023 film reintroduced Mario and Luigi, two tight-knit but struggling Brooklyn plumbers who got separated when they unexpectedly fell into the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sought Princess Peach’s help to rescue his brother from the evil clutches of Bowser, ruler of the Dark Lands, who was keen to marry Peach and threatened to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom with a Super Star if she refused him. So Peach led Mario on a quest to recruit allies and stop Bowser for good. They succeeded, shrinking Bowser and imprisoning him in a jar.

Recently, though, coder Arin Sarkisan has taken the \"Can it Run Doom ?\" idea in an unlikely direction: wireless earbuds that aren't designed to output graphics at all. To be clear, this hack doesn't apply to any generic set of earbuds. The \"Doombuds\" project is designed specifically for the PineBuds Pro , which are unique in featuring completely open source firmware and a community-maintained SDK . That means Sarkisan was able to code up a JavaScript interface that uses the earbuds' UART contact pads to send a heavily compressed MJPEG video stream to a web server (via a serial server). The 2.4 MB/s data stream from the UART connection can put out about 22 to 27 frames per second in this format, which is more than enough for a CPU that can only run the game at a maximum of 18 fps anyway.
