Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.&nbsp; All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data.

Subscribe to read the next edition as soon as it lands. Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI and Trump. Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and the Wall Street Journal . Some houses are devoted to specific topics; for example, there’s one for science and another for AI. But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everythin…",

    "body": "The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure. The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.
