I first saw the Corsair Sabre V2 Pro at Gamescom, but I was told I couldn't speak about it until its launch today. Which, let me tell you, was a difficult ask, because it's thirty-six grams , for pity's sake. How can I keep quiet about a 36 g, non-holey, wireless gaming mouse that seemed—based on my few minutes using it back then—pretty comfortable? Somehow I kept it zipped, though, and I've now had some more time with the mouse. Not enough for a complete picture, mind, just a couple of hours dusting off the cobwebs in a Dust_2 deathmatch last night. And as I suspected, I am smitten, just like I was with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight when that launched. Back then, circa 2020–2021, the Superlight stunned me because it's a wireless mouse that managed to weigh in at just 63 g without the whole holey thing going on.

Oh, and Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel. Hold that thought. The announcement says the partnership will span both enterprise-class AI products and consumer PCs. It's the latter we're most interested in, of course, so here's what the statement has to say about that specifically: \"For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.\" And that really is it, barring some platitudes rolled out by Intel and Nvidia's CEOs, Lip Bu Tan and Jensen Huang respectively. So, what are we to make of it all? It's a pretty extraordinary announcement and it almost certainly wouldn't be happening if Intel wasn't in such deep trouble of late.

Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly.

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.

Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation.

Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency.

    "body": "Xbox on PC is now officially rolling out a feature that might have it become a single stop for all your games. As Xbox's VP of Experiences Jason Beaumont explains , in addition to \"updated app functionality\", one new feature currently rolling out on Windows is an \"aggregated gaming library\". Beaumont has also announced that \"cross-device play history\" will be coming, but that will be later this month. The main library aggregation update rolled out to Insiders a few months ago, but it looks like it's now being released to non-Insiders in regular updates. Those considering using aggregator apps like Playnite , in other words, might not need to do so anymore because they'll be able to use the Xbox app to view their entire game library, not just games bought on the Xbox app itself. This will \"show your installed games from multiple PC storefronts, including your Xbox library, Xbox Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts.\" Getting to those storefronts should be easier, too, as you can use the new 'My Apps' tab in your library to house Battle.net and so on. It's worth noting, though, that third-party apps like Playnite and other aggregators might not be rendered completel…",

Which, in a roundabout, contrarian kind of way, makes me just about perfect to wax sceptical on the subject of the Norbauer & Co Seneca: First Edition , a keyboard that's listed for up to $8,090 and is apparently inspired by the eponymous Stoic philosopher of ancient Roman fame. Yeah, an eight grand keyboard with a praise-poverty sales pitch. More on the metaphysical, you might say epistemological, problems the Seneca association poses in a moment. The base price actually comes in at a piffling $3,600, but at the very least, you'd surely add the optional riser, a piece of CNC-machined wood that's yours for a mere $290 and adds three degrees of pitch. Cheap at twice the price. But how, exactly, does Norbauer & Co. contrive to offer such a pecunious PC peripheral? It's claimed to contain 682 custom parts. But let's start with the main chassis, an aluminium housing finished in \"plasma\" ceramic. That involves \"an oxidation process that uses intense heat and pressure generated by a storm of rapid high-energy micro-arcs, which forms an advanc…",

    "body": "Little Nightmares 3 has released a short demo ahead of its launch on October 10, which will be the first hands-on look we've got at the new setting: The Nowhere. More specifically, the demo whisks you straight to the main city of the game, the Necropolis, a desolated location lost to time and sat in the middle of a desert. As is the way with any Little Nightmares game, you won't be able to navigate this landscape without the threat of a horrifying monster watching your every move. This time though, rather than some bloodthirsty mannequins or an angry teacher with an unsettlingly long neck chasing you, you're being hunted by a giant, monster baby. Yep, that's right. Who needs a gentle introduction to the game with a smaller beast when you could have a giant baby on your tail instead? Throughout the demo you'll also get to play as the new protagonists, Low and Alone, both of whom boast different weapons you'll have to figure out how to use. For Low, that means a trusty bow which can be used to hit high targets or cut through ropes, whereas Alone relies on a heavy wrench perfect for smashing barriers or manipulating machines. Of course, both of these weapons are essential for any ene…",
