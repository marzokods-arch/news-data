    "body": "Harvey Randall, Staff Writer (Image credit: Future) This week I've been: Preparing myself for the possibility of fighting Simon in Clair Obscur again. Last week I was: Recommending you go be cringe in World of Warcraft . It is 2019: Larian is announcing its new RPG , Baldur's Gate 3 . The studio releases a short, cinematic teaser with an emphasis on body horror—the ceremorphosis of an unwitting guard rendered in horrible, gory detail. Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful. Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers.

Developer Sandfall Interactive is so happy, in fact, that it just decided to do the developer equivalent of blowing a kiss: The \"Thank you\" update —that is literally what it's called—adds a bunch of content to the game for the low low price of 'nothin' but disk space', as seen in the trailer below. The full patch notes go into greater detail—I'll rattle off the smaller bits first before we get into the real meat, but to summarise: There's a photo mode, now; You can save \"up to 50 different lumina loadouts\", which is a tremendous quality of life improvement, and there are new filters for them. Lastly, you can abandon battles, rather than simply waiting to die if you messed up. I cannot understate how hyped I am for that lumina loadout detail. I'd estimate a good four to five hours of my 67 hour playtime in Clair Obscur was spent just messing around with my pictos in menus—and it was always agony when a singular fight forced me to custom-tun…",

The trailer features VO from (presumably) some manner of fucko alien complaining about how namby pamby, politically correct, Empire-era emissions and engine size standards ruined speeder racing.

Speeder racing's inevitable reckoning with driver mortality aside, the racing in question looks sick as hell, with a real sense of speed and great use of scenic Star Wars vistas throughout the trailer. I mean, your graphics are certainly pretty enough: Get the handling right, and bing bang boom, that's a Star Wars racing game I'd play.

If all you know about Warframe is that it's a game with space ninjas, the relentless Wagnerian intensity of a Herzog monologue might feel like a strange fit. But Warframe is beautifully, uncannily strange. As Herzog says during the magnificent work of advertising, Warframe is a story about beings \"cursed to walk this senseless universe in living metal, haunted by dreams.\" Warframes are an open question about identity, humanity, and utility. They are a riddle cast in razor iron and warped, quivering meat. They are weapons 3D printed from muscle memory, psychic imprint, and arcane force. They can get pregnant.

I spoke to Neon Giant heads Arcade Berg and Tor Frick again last week, and can add a little more context to the trailer.

At The Game Awards 2025, we got a brief teaser trailer for Fate of the Old Republic, a follow-up to the original games whose development will be headed up by Casey Hudson, project lead on KotOR 1 and the Mass Effect trilogy. The trailer shows an Unreal Engine-rendered star ship—not the original games' Ebon Hawk—piloted to a remote, snowy world. Its pilot and passengers, which include a droid resembling the HK series from KotOR, emerge and approach a downed Sith capital ship from the Old Republic games. There are any number of directions Hudson and co. could go with the story: KotOR 2 had a very vague, open-ended conclusion that has since been elaborated on in various bits and bobs of Star Wars lore crafting, most notably some of the expansions to the long-running Old Republic MMO, but that feels like the sort of stuff you can just treat as a suggestion. Lucasfilm Games and developer Arcanaut Studios are calling Fate of the Old Republic a \"spiritual successor\" to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Given the fact that The Old Republic takes place a good few tho…",

This is the first such licensing deal between one of the major studios and an AI company, and comes less than a month after Disney CEO Bob Iger told shareholders AI is an \"engagement engine\" and Disney+ is soon gonna be crammed with it . To put the cash to one side for a moment, over 200 Disney characters will now be used in OpenAI's products. This includes Mickey Mouse as well as more recent characters like Moana, and then there's Star Wars (the likes of Luke Skywalker included), Marvel, and the Pixar catalogue. Hey, has anyone here seen Wall-E? There is one very notable caveat to the agreement: Disney specifies it \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\" There are a host of obvious reasons why: primarily the likely objection of said talent, such as Mark Hamill, and the inevitable battle for rights that would ensue. Plus you get into a real grey area with characters like Mickey, who was for decades voiced by Walt Disney himself. I appreciate the following sentence may make some raise a cartoon eyebr…",

Cultic has an arsenal of staple FPS guns⁠—pistol, shotgun, magnum, machine gun, etc.—but they hit different. They all have great feedback and sound effects, with headshots turning noggins into geysers of raspberry preserves, as well as gorgeous spritework for their viewmodels.

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall. I've had a couple of problems here and there with arc's vision or bullets not properly being blocked, although I chalked up my issues to the character movement latency that plagued my games at launch. Although this was fixed a month ago and I haven't had any issues since then.
