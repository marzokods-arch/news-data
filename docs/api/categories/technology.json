The K-pop star shared a post on her Instagram today, Sept. 4 , accompanied by the caption, &ldquo;Some sleepless nights.&rdquo; The post featured a short and sweet carousel of photos of the &ldquo;Money&rdquo; singer in Japan, grabbing sushi and showing off her outfit. What drew us to the post, beyond Lisa&rsquo;s obvious sense of style, was her bag charm. View this post on Instagram A post shared by LISA (@lalalalisa_m) While Lisa is clearly a lover of Labubus (she basically started the craze), the Thai star was seen swapping out the monster doll for a fluffier Monchhichi keychain. The vibrant yellow doll was fixed to what looked like a Louis Vuitton P9 series bag in red with tan straps and monogrammed detailing throughout.
