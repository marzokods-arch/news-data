The brand has cut prices across its top robot vacuums , wet dry vacs, stick vacuums, and even air purifiers, with deals running through the weekend on Amazon and its official store. If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade before the holiday chaos hits, the savings are hard to ignore. The standout is the Dreame X50 Ultra, a high-end robot vacuum built for homes where most bots still get tripped up. Its chassis can lift itself to climb over thresholds and door sills, and the corner-reaching system helps it clean further into tight spots than you normally get from a round robot. It also handles hair better thanks to its detangling brush setup, and the base station washes and dries the mop pads with high heat, so you’re not left dealing with damp fibers. With the price falling from $1,599.99 to just $799.99 for Black Friday, it’s one of the biggest drops in Dreame’s lineup.",

Besides playing audio over Bluetooth, these speakers also support Spotify Tap for easy access to your playlists. In addition to its ease of assembly and affordability, what helps IKEA furniture stand apart from the crowd (of other mass-produced furniture) is its inviting vibe and minimal aesthetic. Gladly, its wares extend beyond what has a few feet and sits on the ground. And one category that IKEA has absolutely crushed is obfuscated, visually stunning wireless speakers. IKEA previously offered Wi-Fi-based speakers in partnership with Sonos under its Symfonisk lineup. Since that has come to an end, IKEA has been exploring its own creations. It has now added two new speaker ranges to its inventory in partnership with Swedish designer Tekla Evelina Severin, who’s popularly known as “Teklan.”",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority Qualcomm unveiled its powerhouse Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 back in September and has now quickly followed up with Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 — a more affordable take on its flagship package that should still sit near the top of the chipset pecking order. In another unusual branding decision from Qualcomm, this isn’t an S-series model, unlike the last-gen Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 . More curious is the company’s choice to make direct performance comparisons to its far older 8 Gen 3 (36% better performance and 42% better efficiency), which was released in late 2023, rather than the original 8 Elite. So, without the Elite moniker, is this still a proper high-end option or a mid-range chip in disguise? Let’s dig into how it stacks up against the latest Snapdragon 8-series processors.",

The POCO F8 Pro and Ultra are effectively rebranded, global versions of the China-only Redmi K90 and Redmi K90 Pro Max . The Pro and Ultra devices only have a few things in common, though. Expect the handsets to offer 100W wired charging speeds, an IP68 rating, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, the same display brightness figures, and the Hyper OS 3 skin. Both phones also get four major Android OS upgrades and six years of security patches. However, it’s clear that the Ultra handset is the standout offering here, and not just because of the traditional spec sheet.",

WhatsApp has been working on adding more creative tools to the status feature, which is great.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, which is built on TSMC’s 3nm manufacturing process, is positioned as the less impressive but still “premium” companion of the 8 Elite Gen 5.

Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.

Three years later, the spacecraft detected a signal from the area to the right of the ice cap that scientists interpreted as an underground lake. ESA/DLR/FU Berlin, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Results from an enhanced radar technique have demonstrated improvement to sub-surface observations of Mars. &nbsp; NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revisited and raised new questions about a mysterious feature buried beneath thousands of feet of ice at the Red Planet’s south pole. In a recent study, researchers conclude from data obtained using an innovative radar technique that an area on Mars suspected of being an underground lake is more likely to be a layer of rock and dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2018 discovery of the suspected lake set off a flurry of scientific activity, as water is closely linked with life in the solar system. While the latest findings indicate this feature is not a lake below the Martian surface, it does suggest that the same radar technique could be used to check for subsurface reso…",
