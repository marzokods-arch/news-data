That's not to mention the bizarre accusations being flung around from its co-CEOs. Former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies blamed the game's failure on \" internal and external saboteurs, \" a sentiment that had been echoed by Mark Gerhard just a couple of months prior when he popped off on Discord to claim that the negative reactions to the game were \"100%\" financed by someone . A mystery someone. It's enough of a palaver to make anyone wary of trying again, and IOI CEO Hakan Abrak certainly seems apprehensive to re-enter the lion's den. During a recent interview with IGN , Abrak reflected on the initial response to MindsEye: \"It was a tough reception,\" he said. \"It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners.

I pick up loot and have no idea if it's good or not, the gigantic skill tree gives me chills, and I couldn't tell you anything about the lore. I'm willing to endure the most prickly parts of PoE 2 because the campaign is excellent—and it just got better. The latest update adds a new act that has me fully on board with Grinding Gear Games' vision for an action RPG campaign that might be as ambitious as the version of Diablo 2 that exists in people's memories. I'm too young to have had my mind blown by Blizzard 25 years ago, but right now, in 2025, I'm not sure anyone is doing it like GGG. I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG …",

I’m deeply grateful for the creativity, dedication, and hard work of the teammates we are parting ways with. They will be truly missed.\" The layoffs come a little over a week after a Bloomberg report indicated that Dreamhaven is struggling. Morhaime said in an internal email cited in the report that \"our monthly expenses are outpacing revenue,\" and that it was focused on \"urgently reducing costs\" in order to ensure the company's survival. It's fair to say that expectations for Dreamhaven were great when the company was first announced.

Roblox said the new age estimation tech, combined with Roblox's existing ID verification and parental consent tools, \"will provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account.\" The company also plans on rolling out new systems that will restrict communications between adults and minors unless they know each other in real life. \"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content,\" Roblox said in an update . \"We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow.\" Roblox's facial age estimation works by analyzing a selfie to estimate your age and sort you into a rating group—under 13, 13+, or 18+—with varying restrictions for each category.

Helldivers 2's technical state is bad enough that Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani spent hours yesterday responding to complaints in the Helldivers Discord, taking responsibility for the instability and explaining how Helldivers 2 has built up \"technical debt\" over time. \"Performance is something we've talked about a TON today.

The future of the series will also depend on how the audience takes to the likes of Delta, though in a recent chat with PC Gamer, David Hayter, voice actor for both Solid and Naked Snake, reckons a future without longtime series steward Hideo Kojima is \"absolutely possible\" even if \"there's no way to replicate his exact genius, his exact weirdness, his specific personality.\" Any player of the games will know what Hayter means: the appeal of these things is very much in that weirdness, the absurd level of research that goes into every entry, and some of the most spectacular rug-pulls in gaming history. It turns out that one of these, in fact, was even a surprise to Hayter. \"The funniest question that I get,\" says Hayter, \"so many people are like 'what was it like working with Kojima?'
