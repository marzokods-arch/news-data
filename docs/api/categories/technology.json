It’s a set of 50 machines—everything from a tractor to an oven to a circuit maker—that are capable of building civilization from scratch and can be reconfigured however you see fit.&nbsp; Jakubowski immigrated to the US from Slupca, Poland, as a child. His first encounter with what he describes as the “prosperity of technology” was the vastness of the American grocery store. Seeing the sheer quantity and variety of perfectly ripe produce cemented his belief that abundant, sustainable living was within reach in the United States.&nbsp; With a bachelor’s degree from Princeton and a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Jakubowski had spent most of his life in school.

Now imagine a laser pulse snipping a hole in the blastocyst’s outermost shell so a handful of cells can be suctioned up by a microscopic pipette. This is the moment, thanks to advances in genetic sequencing technology, when it becomes possible to read virtually that entire instruction manual. An emerging field of science seeks to use the analysis pulled from that procedure to predict what kind of a person that embryo might become.

Today, nearly 70% of announced carbon removal contracts are for one technology: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Basically, the idea is to use trees or some other types of biomass for energy, and then capture the emissions when you burn it. While corporations, including tech giants like Microsoft, are betting big on this technology, there are a few potential problems with BECCS, as my colleague James Temple laid out in a new story . And some of the concerns echo similar problems with other climate technologies we cover, like carbon offsets and alternative jet fuels. Carbon math can be complicated. To illustrate one of the biggest issues with BECCS, we need to run through the logic on its carbon accounting. (And while this tech can use many different forms of biomass, let’s assume we’re talking about trees.) When trees grow, they suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those trees can be harvested and used for some intended purpose, like making paper. The leftover material, which might otherwise be …",

WATCH THE WEBCAST “Business process automation has been around a long while. What GenAI and AI agents are allowing us to do is really give superpowers, so to speak, to business process automation.” says chief AI architect at Cloudera, Manasi Vartak. Much of the momentum is being driven by two related forces: the rise of AI agents and the rapid democratization of AI tools. AI agents, whether designed for automation or assistance, are proving especially powerful at speeding up response times and removing friction from complex workflows.

    "body": "For years at Orchard Care Homes, a 23‑facility dementia-care chain in northern England, Cheryl Baird watched nurses fill out the Abbey Pain Scale, an observational methodology used to evaluate pain in those who can’t communicate verbally. Baird, a former nurse who was then the facility’s director of quality, describes it as “a tick‑box exercise where people weren’t truly considering pain indicators.” As a result, agitated residents were assumed to have behavioral issues, since the scale does not always differentiate well between pain and other forms of suffering or distress. They were often prescribed psychotropic sedatives, while the pain itself went untreated. Then, in January 2021, Orchard Care Homes began a trial of PainChek, a smartphone app that scans a resident’s face for microscopic muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output an expected pain score. Within weeks, the pilot unit saw fewer prescriptions and had calmer corridors. “We immediately saw the benefits: ease of use, accuracy, and identifying pain that wouldn’t have been spotted using the old scale,” Baird recalls.

    "body": "Over the last century, much of the US pulp and paper industry crowded into the southeastern corner of the nation, setting up mills amid sprawling timber forests to strip the fibers from juvenile loblolly, long leaf, and slash pine trees. Today, after the factories chip the softwood and digest it into pulp, the leftover lignin, spent chemicals, and remaining organic matter form a dark, syrupy by-product known as black liquor. It’s then concentrated into a biofuel and burned, which heats the towering boilers that power the facility—and releases carbon dioxide into the air. Microsoft , JP MorganChase , and a tech company consortium that includes Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, and Stripe have all recently struck multimillion-dollar deals to pay paper mill owners to capture at least hundreds of thousands of tons of this greenhouse gas by installing carbon scrubbing equipment in their facilities. The captured carbon dioxide will then be piped down into saline aquifers more than a mile underground, where it should be sequestered permanently. Big Tech is suddenly betting big on this form of carbon removal, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. The sector also includes bi…",

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse it Wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active. Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story . —Jessica Hamzelou Can we repair the internet?
