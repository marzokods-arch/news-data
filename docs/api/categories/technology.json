This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post. It's all on the same servers so you won't have to buy the Steam version to play with Steam players, and you've always had the option of adding Tarkov as a non-Steam game to your library if all you want is the ease of access and the overlay. But all the other big features—friend list synchronization, Steam achievements, lifelong playtime tracking—will be exclusive to those who buy it through the platform. It also means players with thousands of hours sunk in will only be able to leave a review on the new storefront if they buy the game again. If you…",

Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

Taiwanese outlet CTEE claims that Nvidia will be the first to adopt TSMC's A16 node due to competition from AMD, in part for what it calls HPC or high performance chips built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node and due out this year. The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs . That's a physical limit on the size of an individual chip that can be etched onto a wafer. That physical size in turn puts a hard limit on how many transistors can be squeezed into a si…",

    "body": "\"If they're into the traditional turn-based hardcore stuff, it might not be for them,\" says Julian Gollop, the man who gave us X-Com and ushered in decades of tense turn-based tactical challenges. He's talking about his new game, the colourful, easy going Chip 'N Clawz vs The Brainoids . With its Fortnite-adjacent aesthetic and focus on co-op, Chip 'N Clawz is worlds away from the devastatingly challenging X-Com, or even the more streamlined modern incarnation. And when you're so firmly associated with a specific game or series, as Gollop is, any deviation from that formula can be jarring. So his comment that he's not really trying to appeal to that audience might come as a surprise. But he argues that there's still something for strategy fans to be found within this new adventure. \"I think there's enough strategy in there for strategy fans, for sure,\" he says. But \"there's not too much complexity,\" he acknowledges, \"particularly in the way the game is controlled or the way it's understood\". But Gollop isn't worried if his hardcore fans aren't into it. \"That's not a problem,\" he says. \"There are other people that it would appeal to.\" What he really wants is to bring in new players…",

Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",
