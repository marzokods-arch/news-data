Having the best guns in Arc Raiders is helpful and all, but I'd say knowing your surroundings is actually more important to your success. Can you quickly retreat to a safe location without having to check your map and waste precious seconds? Do you know where locked rooms are? Where's the best place to ambush roaming raiders? How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part. Nevertheless, that's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you various named locations across Arc Raiders' five maps, and all you need to do is enter the correct name. And that's the official in-game name, not any shorthand versions. For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to use named locations marked on your map . While some are outside, none are in random parts of the map.

    "body": "Doom: The Dark Ages received a whole new mode back in August—the wave-based \"Ripatorium\" that allows players to build their own demonic encounters. But it seems id Software has had a rethink about the Ripatorium, as The Dark Ages' latest update substantially overhauls how it works. While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format. Previously, players only had broad control over an encounter, able to select enemies they wanted to fight, dictate number of times enemies would respawn and choose whether or not to set a time limit or to s…",

If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

For me, that's Arc Raiders' rusted gears , a mid-level crafting material needed to upgrade the gunsmith bench. The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

Windows head Pavan Davuluri said earlier this month that Microsoft's OS is \"evolving into an agentic OS,\" and I can't say I'm excited about the prospect. Suleyman's inability to comprehend that lack of enthusiasm can easily be resolved with a classic technique from ancient philosophy, or maybe it was an ad for taco shells , in which one accepts two different things at the same time.

Turns out that, rather than falling victim to an enormous monetary calamity or getting snapped up by Tencent, Ubi's finances were delayed because the company appointed new auditors in July. So that was a bit of a damp squib, but it doesn't mean nothing of note came from the report itself. For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"? No? How odd. After all, Guillemot points out that AI is \"as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on the front\" which certainly has the tenor of something that should get us all very excited. Guillemot and Ubisoft have been banging the AI drum for a while now. Last year, it unveiled its AI-powered \" neo-NPCs ,\" promising that \"each conversation between the player and an NPC\" would be \"unique and responsive to the players and their actions, leading to fully personalized and immersive experiences.\" So, …",

Rhythm Psychosis is a who's-who of big hardcore composers in the space: REDALiCE, t+pazolite, Laur, P*Light… basically anyone currently under the HARDCORE TANO*C label. Which might mean a big load of bunk to you, but to me? It means I can confidently say this game is gonna be a good'un, especially after an hour with its demo. That's if you can deal with the denpa -ness of it all, which thankfully I am fully equipped to handle. Some might even go so far as to say I enjoy it. Yunyun Syndrome is bizarre and creepy, dressed up in wailing anime girls and pinky-purple hues that almost offset how unsettling the entire experience is, both in its visuals and denpa-heavy song list.
