    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. AI is changing how we quantify pain Researchers around the world are racing to turn pain—medicine’s most subjective vital sign—into something a camera or sensor can score as reliably as blood pressure. The push has already produced PainChek—a smartphone app that scans people&#8217;s faces for tiny muscle movements and uses artificial intelligence to output a pain score—which has been cleared by regulators on three continents and has logged more than 10 million pain assessments. Other startups are beginning to make similar inroads. The way we assess pain may finally be shifting, but when algorithms measure our suffering, does that change the way we treat it?

Over the course of three days of main-stage sessions, I learned about innovations in AI, biotech, and robotics.&nbsp; But as you might imagine, some of this climate reporter’s favorite moments came in the climate sessions. I was listening especially closely to my colleague James Temple’s discussion with Lucia Tian, head of advanced energy technologies at Google.&nbsp; They spoke about the tech giant’s growing energy demand and what sort of technologies the company is looking to to help meet it. In case you weren’t able to join us, let’s dig into that session and consider how the company is thinking about energy in the face of AI’s rapid rise.&nbsp; I’ve been closely following Google’s work in energy this year. Like the rest of the tech industry, the company is seeing ballooning electricity demand in its data centers. That could get in the way of a major goal that Google has been talking about for years.&nbsp; See, back in 2020, the company announced an ambitious target: by 2030, it aimed to run on carbon-free energy 24-7.

It’s something of a familiar cycle by now: Tragedy hits; rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories follow. It’s often even more acute in the case of a natural disaster, when conspiracy theories about what “really” caused the calamity run right into culture-war-driven climate change denialism. Put together, these theories obscure real causes while elevating fake ones. I’ve studied these ideas extensively, having spent the last 10 years writing about conspiracy theories and disinformation as a journalist and researcher. I’ve covered everything from the rise of QAnon to whether Donald Trump faked his assassination attempt. I’ve written three books, testified to Congress, and even written a report for the January 6th Committee.&nbsp; Still, I’d never lived it. Not until my house in Altadena, California, burned down.

Manually mapping dependencies and rewriting legacy apps mid-flight was not an enticing, low-lift proposition for enterprise IT teams. But the calculus for such decisions has changed dramatically in a short period of time. Following recent VMware licensing changes, organizations are seeing greater uncertainty around the platform’s future. At the same time, cloud-native innovation is accelerating. According to the CNCF’s 2024 Annual Survey , 89% of organizations have already adopted at least some cloud-native techniques, and the share of companies reporting nearly all development and deployment as cloud-native grew sharply from 2023 to 2024 (20% to 24%).

    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. The quest to find out how our bodies react to extreme temperatures Climate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions. While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world.

    "body": "Welcome back to&nbsp;The State of AI, a new collaboration between the Financial Times and MIT Technology Review. Every Monday, writers from both publications debate one aspect of the generative AI revolution and how it is reshaping global power. This week, Casey Crownhart, senior reporter for energy at MIT Technology Review and Pilita Clark, FT&#8217;s columnist, consider how China&#8217;s rapid renewables buildout could help it leapfrog on AI progress. Casey Crownhart writes : In the age of AI, the biggest barrier to progress isn’t money but energy . That should be particularly worrying here in the US, where massive data centers are waiting to come online, and it doesn’t look as if the country will build the steady power supply or infrastructure needed to serve them all. It wasn’t always like this. For about a decade before 2020, data centers were able to offset increased demand with efficiency improvements . Now, though, electricity demand is ticking up in the US, with billions of queries to popular AI models each day—and efficiency gains aren’t keeping pace. With too little new power capacity coming online, the strain is starting to show: Electricity bills are ballooning for pe…",

    "body": "AI and quantum technologies are dramatically reconfiguring how cybersecurity functions, redefining the speed and scale with which digital defenders and their adversaries can operate. The weaponization of AI tools for cyberattacks is already proving a worthy opponent to current defenses. From reconnaissance to ransomware, cybercriminals can automate attacks faster than ever before with AI. This includes using generative AI to create social engineering attacks at scale, churning out tens of thousands of tailored phishing emails in seconds, or accessing widely available voice cloning software capable of bypassing security defenses for as little as a few dollars. And now, agentic AI raises the stakes by introducing autonomous systems that can reason, act, and adapt like human adversaries. But AI isn’t the only force shaping the threat landscape. Quantum computing has the potential to seriously undermine current encryption standards if developed unchecked. Quantum algorithms can solve the mathematical problems underlying most modern cryptography, particularly public-key systems like RSA and Elliptic Curve, widely used for secure online communication, digital signatures, and cryptocurre…",

It has long, gray banquettes that convert into bunks, a microwave cleverly hidden under a counter, a functional steel sink with a French press and crockery above. A weird little toilet hides behind a curtain. But you can’t just fire up Vanguard’s engine and roll off the lot. Once it is sealed and moved to its permanent home beneath the waves of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary early next year, Vanguard will be the world’s first new subsea habitat in nearly four decades.
