So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

Anyway, this is all to say that I think the most recent update to the Steam client—itself essentially a packaging of a bunch of fixes that have been pushed to Steam's beta branch recently—is, stealthily, very much about prepping for Valve's black box. I say this because Steam's January 21 client update practically vibrates with controller fixes and updates. Support for the Nintendo Switch 2 wired controller has been re-enabled, there are new settings for joystick responses, fixes for gyro aiming, and plenty else besides (find the full list down below).

Simply asking a teammate to change off Black Widow and to pick a character better suited for the comp they were likely about to come up against. And may I just add that Kingsman asked very nicely as well, much nicer than I would have if there was prize money on the line. The response to his request wasn't as nice, though. The team lead, Cece, alongside the Widow main Zazza, and Kingsman's duo Luci, piled on him, making fun of the fact that he wanted to try in the tournament and then attacking his character in now leaked messages. It was also revealed that Zazza's boyfriend was the one who got Kingsman kicked from the competition after sending over an embellished evidence document to Basim.

According to CFO, David Zinsner, the company has dodged the worst of the ongoing memory crisis by being \"relatively aggressive\" in securing memory for the mobile chip. \"I think we've got what we need based on the current forecast,\" Zinsner says. \"Of course, that could always tick up, and then we would need more memory which would kind of impact gross margins. But we were relatively aggressive in terms of getting the memory early\" (transcript via SeekingAlpha ). Lunar Lake is particularly at-risk from the ongoing memory crisis, which has seen memory in tight supply and prices skyrocket, due to its use of on-package memory. Take a look at the package and you can see two LPDDR5X chips nestled besides the processor. This has benefits for efficiency and size, but has caused some headaches for Intel. One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips. As such, Lunar Lake has not offered the sort of margins that Intel would like, and buying more memory at today's prices would make matters worse. \"Th…",

Alas, Armored Core: Mobile 3 is not likely an instalment the masses will embrace. It was originally released for flip phones in 2007, and further complicating matters, it was a Japanese exclusive. While that's not exactly the case now—you can easily go and buy Armored Core: Mobile 3 on Steam right now—few will have the patience to play it without English subs. Indeed, no major efforts have been made to modernize this ancient artefact, though it does appear to have controller support. Here's the trailer: If that's not enough to discourage you, it's pretty cool to have this curio made available again. It takes place between Armored Core Nexus and Armored Core Last Raven, both of which were offshoots of Armored Core 3. They released for PlayStation 2 in 2004 and 2005 respectively (PS2 owners ate well: a huge seven Armored Core games released for the platform). The format is pretty …",

Does that clear things up for you? Okay, maybe not, so let's recap. The whole thing began when New Blood honcho Dave Oshry said the studio's stealth FPS Blood West saw a 200% increase in sales on Steam while it was available for free on the Epic Games Store over the holidays: \"Turns out having your game be free on Epic is great advertising for Steam sales!\" In response, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took the high road, saying sometimes Steam comes out on top, sometimes Epic does, \"but one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals.\" That sparked a reaction from Larian Studios publishing chief Michael Douse, who retweeted Sweeney to say that although Epic fully funded the development of Alan Wake 2, keeping the game off of Steam may have done more harm than good in the long run: \"This altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial…",

This is the Hotel Stella Montis, and while I'm sure its accommodations are lovely, it owes its recent influx of praise to the other Stella Montis —the popular Arc Raiders map that's driving players to flood the Italian hotel with reviews celebrating its lively (if occasionally hostile) guests, lootable blueprints, and proactive robotic security (via Arc Raiders Alerts on X). A reviewer by the name of Bad Wolf kicked off the bit about a month ago, saying that while \"everything is great\" about the hotel, \"the only issue is that players sometimes spawn just 10 meters away from me.\" In the weeks since, all but one review—left by guests who enjoyed a \"ski-related stay\"—have been Arc Raiders references, ranging from the simple \"Hey, Raider! Don't shoot!\" to warnings that other guests be wary of hostile Arcs if they're passing through ventilation shafts. (Image credit: Google) One raider reviewer left a fond note describing their \"eventful\" Night Raid stay, where they stumbled across flute-playing kitchen s…",

I exaggerate slightly , but tech writer Corbin Davenport released a tool last week called Just the Browser that offers the faintest glimmer of light in this AI abyss we now call the web. Per the description on Just the Browser's Github page, the project is a script that, when run, will \"remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from web browsers.\" On Windows, all you have to do is open PowerShell as administrator and copy-paste this command: & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.ps1\"))) The script will then ask you which browser you wish to de-AI, with support for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Press a couple keys and you're done. It's just as simple to run in the terminal on Mac or Linux. To set expectations, Just the Browser does not touch anything on the actual websites you visit, which means you're still going to be seeing AI crap all over the place. It is not a silver bullet.
