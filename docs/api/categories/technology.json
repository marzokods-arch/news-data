    "body": "In late 2023, a long-trusted virtualization staple became the biggest open question on the enterprise IT roadmap. Amid concerns of VMware licensing changes and steeper support costs, analysts noticed an exodus mentality. Forrester predicted that one in five large VMware customers would begin moving away from the platform in 2024. A subsequent Gartner community poll found that 74% of respondents were rethinking their VMware relationship in light of recent changes. CIOs contending with pricing hikes and product roadmap opacity face a daunting choice : double‑down on a familiar but costlier stack, or use the disruption to rethink how—and where—critical workloads should run.

    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. OpenAI is huge in India. Its models are steeped in caste bias. Caste bias is rampant in OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, according to an MIT Technology Review investigation. Though CEO Sam Altman boasted about India being its second-largest market during the launch of GPT-5 in August, we found that both this new model, which now powers ChatGPT, as well as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video generator, exhibit caste bias. This risks entrenching discriminatory views in ways that are currently going unaddressed. Mitigating caste bias in AI models is more pressing than ever. In contemporary India, many caste-oppressed Dalit people have escaped poverty and have become doctors, civil service officers, and scholars; some have even risen to become the president of India. But AI models continue to reproduce socioeconomic and occupational stereotypes that render Dalits as dirty, poor, and performing only menial jobs.

    "body": "When Dhiraj Singha began applying for postdoctoral sociology fellowships in Bengaluru, India, in March, he wanted to make sure the English in his application was pitch-perfect. So he turned to ChatGPT. He was surprised to see that in addition to smoothing out his language, it changed his identity—swapping out his surname for “Sharma,” which is associated with privileged high-caste Indians. Though his application did not mention his last name, the chatbot apparently interpreted the “s” in his email address as Sharma rather than Singha, which signals someone from the caste-oppressed Dalits. “The experience [of AI] actually mirrored society,” Singha says.&nbsp; Singha says the swap reminded him of the sorts of microaggressions he’s encountered when dealing with people from more privileged castes. Growing up in a Dalit neighborhood in West Bengal, India, he felt anxious about his surname, he says. Relatives would discount or ridicule his ambition of becoming a teacher, implying that Dalits were unworthy of a job intended for privileged castes. Through education, Singha overcame the internalized shame, becoming a first-generation college graduate in his family. Over time he learned to …",

Recent predictions anticipate that GPU and accelerator installations will increase by 17% year over year through 2030. But, in reality, CPUs are still responsible for the vast majority of today’s most cutting-edge scientific, engineering, and research workloads. Evan Burness, who leads Microsoft Azure’s HPC and AI product teams, estimates that CPUs still support 80% to 90% of HPC simulation jobs today.
