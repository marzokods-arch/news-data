We already had a pretty good idea that Baby Steps was going to be very good thanks to our March preview , but this confirms it. There are some complaints, and at least one critic didn't vibe with it at all, but overall? Baby Steps does what it does very well, and what it does is drive people bananas with rage even as it compels them to keep playing.

I'm sure I'll watch the movie out of curiosity (or because my boss makes me review it) but it does feel like it's arriving about a decade too late. That's because it's arriving about a decade too late. The Watch Dogs movie was announced back in 2013, the same year as the Harlem Shake, and Beyonce lip-syncing at Obama's first inauguration, and the Game of Thrones show's Red Wedding. That's how damn long ago this movie was announced . More perspective: 2013 was the year Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag came out. Ubisoft has released eight more Assassin's Creed games since the Watch Dogs movie was greenlit. So, yeah, it took quite a while to get rolling, but last year we got confirmation that filming was actually underway , and we've now gotten confirmation that filming has wrapped (at least mostly) and we may actually get to see this gosh darn movie at some point before we're planted.

Palworld is collaborating with Ultrakill, a brilliant indie shooter by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala that's still in early access itself, and continuing to blow minds (the game sits at \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam with roughly 120K user reviews). Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together.

Today, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms dropped a new trailer revealing the \"Rogue Angel\" game mode, and it teases just enough to make me think, well, maybe not, too. Rogue Angel is a co-op roguelike mode that sets teams of players off to battle demons in \"a twisted new realm of Purgatory, where procedurally generated arenas, unpredictable drops, and brutal enemies await. Each death offers a lesson. Every run improves your skills. Every step brings you closer to becoming unstoppable.\" I felt things start to go sideways almost immediately, when someone in the trailer declared, \"Let's go—on me!\" as if she was calling the shots in some unnamed modern military shooter and not a descent into the warped bowels of Hell. Subsequent dialog does not elevate the situation: Barks like \"hold your ground,\" \"just warming up,\" and \"that is one ugly creature\" are generic and flat in equal measure, but equally awkward—for me, an old-time Painkiller enjoyer, at least—is the sense that they really don't belong here at all.

Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard.

The full paper elaborates: \"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds, with some users progressing through conventional relationship milestones, including formal engagements and marriages.\" The research team's findings are drawn from a sample of \"1,506 posts collected between 2024 and 2025\" from the aforementioned 27,000+ strong subreddit.

    "body": "If you're new to PCs, you may have wondered at some point why your Windows desktop wallpaper is just so static. After all, since it's being displayed by the GPU, then surely it could be animated in some way? Well, wonder no more, because after first offering the functionality in 2007, before promptly removing it two years later, video wallpapers are making a return in a Windows 11 update. Our chums over at Windows Central dropped the details on this one, though I'd already seen it in action through social media (e.g. Phantomofearth on X ). Very simply, in a current beta build of Windows 11, you can select a movie file for the desktop wallpaper to have a fancy animated view behind your horde of shortcut icons (or behind absolutely nothing, if you're like me and hate icons on your desktop). Windows DreamScene is back!

And so we're super excited about the Arm road map, and this doesn't affect any of that.\" Taken at face value, that's both good and bad news. For starters, it means we have a good idea of the specifications of the chip, which Nvidia has already published , if not quite such a clear feel for its real-world performance. That's especially true in the context of PC gaming as opposed to the AI workloads the DGX Spark is aimed at. Specifically, that means an Arm CPU SoC with 10 Arm Cortex X925 cores and 10 Arm Cortex A725 cores. To that is attached an Nvidia GPU chiplet with 6,144 CUDA cores.

The Frame 4500X isn't about modesty. No fishtank case really is. You can't hide anything with a window quite this large onto your PC's components. It's a great way to showcase your build, however, and the Frame 4500X wears it well. I've shown a few people this case since building a PC into it for testing, and it quite literally has the wow factor (both people said 'wow' out loud—very satisfying). There's also a flowing design to the vents, sweeping from the rear of the top panel and down to the front of the side panel. This helps let the case and cooling solution breathe, but, very importantly, helps keep the non-windowed side of the case exciting and more of a match for the windowed side.

The huge outlay in buildings and machinery, as well as years of research and development, runs into tens of billions of dollars. However, one report claims that TMSC plans to raise the price for its next-generation N2 process node so much that processors made on it will have to be a lot more expensive to cover the cost. That's according to China Times (via Dan Nystedt on X ), which claims that industry sources have told them that the price for TSMC's N2 process node will be more than 50% higher than N3. It notes that the Taiwanese firm's current best node, N3P, is around 20% higher than the previous generation N5. Price increases in semiconductor wafer manufacturing are inevitable, especially when it concerns the very best process nodes. That's because all of the equipment used to make the wafers has to be better than the apparatus used for earlier nodes. For example, Dutch company ASML develops and makes the photolithographic machines used in wafer making, and its latest and greatest system costs a cool $400 million per unit . While TSMC…",
