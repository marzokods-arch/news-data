The length of runs is perfect, there's the perfect amount of distractions to regularly pull you away from the best-laid plans, and the exhilaration of making it out never gets old. And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs. And with regard to the game lacking custom loadouts, which players could quickly shuffle between runs, he says \"we've talked about\" them and it…",

Part of the problem is that… well, you're playing World of Warcraft, and as much as I'd like to speak kindly about the population of one of my favourite MMORPGs, let's be real, if you jump into public groups you're starting a countdown timer until someone starts rifling through their books of expletives to describe what they did to one of your familial relations. One of the hurdles lies in dungeon \"routing\". Because Mythic+ dungeons are all on a timer, and because WoW's dungeons tend to be a little more open-plan than something you'd get in, say, Final Fantasy 14, every single dungeon has a bespoke route filled with little tricks. And because this is Mythic+, you are expected to know them immediately, lest you be deemed a n00b, or something far ruder, which I won't publish on this website. Well, Blizzard's tinkering with a solution. On the Midnight beta test servers, the studio's introduced a new \"affix\"—basically a modifier—to Mythic+ levels 2-5.

Given an unlimited supply of people, how many dudes would you have to throw at the gorilla before it went down? 50? 100? Would the dudes and the gorillas be better served by turning against the masters that placed them in this arena in the first place? Those are some of the thoughts propelling How Many Dudes? a so-called \"dudebuilder\" roguelike where you amass an army of guys to pummel animals of varying quantities and sizes (and occasionally toddlers, I don't like to think about the toddlers). Really though, it's an auto-battler, and it's honestly a solid bit of fun. Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

I spoke with Mark Cooke, founder and CEO of Shiny Shoe about Destiny of the Railforged, how this ambitious new mode works, and what mechanics the new clan brings to bear. The new mode, Soul Savior Monster Train 2 takes place in heaven, but the new mode, Soul Savior, plays out in a spacey, ethereal realm called the Soulstream, where you fight to reclaim souls from a final boss called the Lifemother. The mode isn't a novelty side attraction, but a fresh way of playing Monster Train 2 that the studio wants to be equal in depth and complexity to the main game.

    "body": "I've waited for over a decade for a true successor to the Corsair Carbide Air 540 . With plenty of room for storage, fans, and a disk drive in its dual-chamber design, the Air 540 was a great pick for my own PC back in 2014. Though I've since moved on, and that case has been stuck in storage for years. Now, finally— finally— we have a true successor in the Corsair Air 5400. The Air 5400 isn't just a rerun of old ideas. It's still a stocky cuboid, but where the Air 540 championed a dual-chamber design that has become the norm for PC cases, the Air 5400 offers a triple-chamber design. Think of it like three distinct zones: there's the main one, for showing off your build; the rear one, with plenty of room for cable management; and a third one, for mounting an all-in-one liquid cooler's radiator inside. The idea behind the third chamber is pretty simple. By mounting the radiator away from other components, and with ample airflow, hot air generated by the CPU can be efficiently expelled from the case and not warm anything around it. It also removes the need for the radiator to block precious fan mounting locations. It's a slick solution. The radiator is mounted toward the front of the…",

    "body": "Earlier this week, I took a look at DDR5-7200 memory prices , and immediately regretted it. With such runaway memory prices, it's hardly surprising that sales of have seen a dip as a result—or that some folks are not even opting for last-gen hardware, but extremely old CPUs to make the most of last-last-gen memory. To be clear, DDR4 memory pricing isn't much more sensible than DDR5; according to TrendForce's latest report , \"the average spot price of mainstream chips (i.e., DDR4 1Gx8 3200 MT/s) has increased by 9.64% from US$25.407 last week (Jan.7) to US$27.857 this week (Jan.14).\" A near 10% price increase in just one week is huge. Understandably, many buyers are opting to hold off on upgrades, resulting in sluggish sales for both DDR5 and DDR4 memory. That's left DDR3 motherboard sales to take centre stage instead, apparently increasing between two and three times in the Chinese DIY market alone. Boards bundled up with 6th to 9th Generation Intel CPUs are apparently also getting a lot more attention (via Videocardz ). Supply has a huge impact on memory pricing. In the aforementioned case of DDR5 memory, there's less to go round in part thanks to the AI industry buying up a whol…",
