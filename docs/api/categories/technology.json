In the meantime I stayed up trying to find out as much as I possibly could about the characters and setting. When Little Nightmares 2 launched it took me a single day to get through. You literally couldn't have peeled me away from it if you tried. So, when the third game was announced in 2023, the excitement started all over again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first game of the series to be developed by Supermassive Games rather than Tarsier Studios. Despite this change, it certainly looks the exact same as the other two games. When you begin the adventure, you awaken in a strange environment overwhelmed by a feeling of dread, and everything around you looks gigantic to really emphasise how small you are as a child. The same goes for the various humanlike creatures you encounter, alongside the main villains, all of which tower over you. In previous games, one of the things that made the villains so scary w…",

Unless fed with the right number of Watts in the right sort of way, the Triton refused to give up the goods and unlock its Turbo mode, providing lacklustre benchmark scores. Having cast some runes, spoken with the winds, examined the entrails of a pigeon being eaten by a red kite in the road just outside my house, and consulted ChatGPT—all of which had about the same level of accuracy—it took a consultation with PCG's own sage and oracle Dave to get to the bottom of the problem. There are multiple lessons here, not the least of which is that red kites are bloody brilliant and we should have more of them to keep those pigeons in check.

That's not because it's not worth the $150 asking fee, but that, in the months I've been watching its stock, it has sold for $100 / $110 almost as much as it has $150. Though it's not on sale right now, I've seen it discounted at both Amazon and Best Buy multiple times over the last few months. At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases. However, down to $100, it makes a lot more sense, and isn't too far from the prices of standard 1080p webcams. With its look and price point, the Insta360 Link 2C is a natural competitor to the Obsbot Meet 2 , which is still the cutest webcam I've ever used, almost a year after first using …",

Speaking with PC Gamer US editor-in-chief Tyler Wilde, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said the shared timing made for a fortuitous opportunity. \"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen,\" Watkins said. \"It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.\" Of course, Arc Raiders and Marathon are different games, but it's hard not to compare the two. Timing aside, when PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park played both back-to-back earlier this year, he noted \"both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit,\" adding he was \"skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.\" For Watki…",

As reported by Automaton , Uematsu told JASRAC he \"never used AI and probably never will … music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections.\" Uematsu has shared concerns about the changing face of videogame music before. Last year, he said there's a worrisome wave of game directors content with \"Hollywood-style\" music, adding even then that AI tools would prevent composers from \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\" More recently, he lamented a perceived stagnation in game music, with too many composers aping John Williams.

But this pencil-scrawl to your local newsagent nonetheless has a few landmarks worth visiting between now and the end of the year. The most significant of these is probably new game plus, which Techland describes as being \"highly anticipated\" in its Steam post detailing the roadmap. Personally, the absolute last thing I want to do after putting a 30+ hour game to bed is immediately start playing it again, but it appears I am in the minority on this. Elsewhere, the next few weeks will also introduce 'Legend Levels', a new nightmare difficulty, extra weapon executions, and ray tracing on PC. Techland doesn't specify precisely when each of these updates will arrive, but my guess is they'll be drip-fed alongside the roadmap's initial reveal—a series of weekly community challenges Techland has dubbed 'Call of the Beast'.

But the plan then was to release Arc in October (although the date hadn't yet been announced) and it stayed that way, because despite the fans angling for a surprise drop, it was \"absolutely not ready,\" design director Virgil Watkins told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"It was interesting to see how many people wanted us to drop it, or even shortly after [the playtest], expected us to drop the game,\" said Watkins. \"But on our end, the game was absolutely not ready.

That leads me to a second problem: The odds of Arc Raiders ever getting a first-person mode are basically zero. That little spot of disappointment comes from Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins, who told PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde in a recent interview that the game was built around the third-person perspective, and that shifting to a first-person view doesn't \"give us a benefit of any sort.\" \"I think so much of our immersion and world and the interactions that your character has with the things in the world, the enemies, the other players, is so amplified by the quality that's come from our animation team and our audio team and our environment team, that it works together as this very nice package that you can really place your character in that world,\" Watkins said. \"That's not to say that's not possible in first per…",

The playable demo skips the surprisingly long setup of Friedkin's film, planting your straight in the cabin of a snorting, grunting '70s flatbed loaded with a single crate of pure liquid concussion. You're then tasked with navigating a twisting morass of slippery, crumbling dirt tracks with nothing but a crude map and nerves of steel.

Despite the enviable crush of players, the test seems to be going very well. Embark Studios pushed a hotfix shortly after the playtest started to address crashes and errors, which unfortunately required a \"full redownload\" of the game, but said that \"should not be the norm moving forward.\" Since that patch, though, there's been no indication of big issues: Two of our best men, Morgan Park and Lincoln Carpenter, are apparently spending their Friday, uhh, testing the game , and say they haven't run into any issues.
