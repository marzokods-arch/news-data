The latest episode is focused entirely on Disco's art, which means Rostov gets to talk almost the entire way through, and everything he says is fascinating. I was most interested in his comments on why Disco Elysium, which bucks CRPG tradition in so many ways, follows genre convention in having a top-down isometric perspective. \"The isometric image is wonderful in that it is flat,\" Rostov says. \"There's none of this 3D, like a million viewpoints. It's just this one image, in essence. You can design the entire game as if it was a painting. And that's kind of what we did.\" Technical artist Siim Raidma mentions the importance of one Pillars of Eternity video from back when Obsidian's CRPG was still in-development, and which explained how its graphics were rendered.

That includes a technical overhaul coming mid-year—\"We're ripping out the guts of the Epic Games Launcher on PC,\" Allison said—as well as new social features. There are plans to test \"community and forums around some of the top games on the store\" and add player profiles, avatars, private messaging, voice chat, and game-independent parties. Epic remains more cautious than Steam about social features The addition of forums represents a shift in approach.

Nesmith has some pretty firm beliefs about decisions that have been made about the hugely popular Elder Scrolls series over time, at least one of which had my esteemed colleague Joshua Wolens despairing (it's a lore thing). He's asked about the idea of lowering barriers to entry for new players within the series, and whether it's a trend he expects to see continue with The Elder Scrolls 6. \"Absolutely, and I led the charge on that, to be frank,\" says Nesmith. \"Obviously I had to persuade Todd, as he is the ultimate arbiter on these things, but I managed to do so. I did a lot of the character systems and one of Todd's philosophies early on in Oblivion, which I took to heart and why I pushed so hard for these things, is that he wanted an interfaceless game so ideally you just play the game.

After considerable backlash towards its announcement that Firefox would become an 'AI browser' over the next few years, it looks to have changed its tune in recent weeks. Beyond the declaration that it's building a ' rebel alliance ' to challenge Big Tech's current plans for AI-integrated toasters and the like, it's now announced a new AI controls section within the browser's settings menu. It'll begin rolling out in Firefox 148, which is due to release on February 24, and looks to be an easy way to block \"current and future generative AI features\" within the browser. Per Mozilla's Firefox blog : \"AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it. \"We’ve heard from many who want nothing to do with AI. We’ve also heard from others who want AI tools that are genuinely useful. Listening to our community, alongside our ongoing commitment to offer choice, led us to build AI controls.\" (Image credit: Firefox) The new menu allows you to turn on or off a host of AI features, including translations, alt text in PDFs, AI-enhance…",

Featuring a beamforming microphone, the G325 ditches the usual boom arm we're used to seeing on gaming headsets. It uses a microphone built into the earcup that's taking aim at your mouth, and using AI-powered denoising to keep non-mouth sounds away from the feed. I've experimented with beamforming microphones before. Both on the Bang & Olufsen Portal and Audeze Maxwell —with the former being my go-to headphones for a long while now. Admittedly, the beamforming microphone on both is weaker than your average boom arm, and by some margin, but perhaps noise cancelling will come to the rescue here. I'm yet to try out the Logitech headset myself, but Logitech employees using the headset sounded clear enough in a pre-briefing call in a quiet space. But hey, we can put it to the test soon ourselves. The G325 are wireless cans, with both Logitech's 2.4 GHz tech, Lightspeed Wireless, and Bluetooth 5.2. They also support 24-bit audio, though no word on the exact drivers used here to make the most of it. Logitech G32…",

These are the latest rumours around the two biggest players in AI. So, could their unholy alliance be faltering? Last week, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Nvidia is rethinking its previously announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over concerns regarding its ability to compete with the likes of Google and Anthropic. Then yesterday, Reuters posted a story detailing the reported dissatisfaction of OpenAI with Nvidia's GPUs, specifically for the task of inferencing AI models. If the latter story looks a lot like somebody at OpenAI hitting back at the original Wall Street Journal claims, the two narratives combined feel like just the sort of tit-for-tat off-the-record briefing that occurs when an alliance is beginning to falter. For now, none of this is official. It's all rumour. However, it is true that Nvidia's intention to invest $100 billion in OpenAI was announced in September and has yet to be finalised. The Wall Street Journal claims that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has \"privately criticized what he has described as…",

At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable. There's a new radial menu for emotes, from which you can trigger new happy emotes like \"vibe\" or \"love you\" (do not perform the despair emot…",

Not for much longer, though: Adobe announced today that Animate will soon be removed from sale, with support and access to the software ending over the next few years. According to an FAQ , Adobe Animate will no longer be available to purchase (it's actually a monthly subscription) starting March 1. After that, existing enterprise customers will be able to access the software and receive technical support until March 1, 2029, while customers with individual licenses only have until March 1, 2027 to keep using Adobe Animate. It may not be as popular as it was in the heyday of Newgrounds , but Adobe Animate is still used to make new shows, such as Star Trek: Lower Decks, as well as videogames. The animations for Mewgenics , the latest game from important Flash game designers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, were made in Adobe Animate. It's easy to tell: The Flash vector animation tools impart a distinctive look that defined the aesthetic of web games throughout the late '90s and 2000s. \"It cannot be overstated, fuck Adobe,\" said …",
