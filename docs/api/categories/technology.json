The game's Steam reviews have been absolutely tanking and the reason will surprise no-one who's played it: performance. I'm a Monster Hunter megafan and, when it released, Wilds ran so poorly for those opening weeks that it pretty much put me off. The crossover update launched on September 29, 2025, and since then there have been just over 5,000 reviews posted, with just under 80% of those negative. The Steam reviews make for some grim reading , and what's especially notable is how many of them begin by talking about the reviewer's love for the Monster Hunter series, with the obvious comparison point of MH: World frequently used. The game's overall reviews are just about treading water at \"Mixed\" but those 5,000 \"mostly negative\" recent reviews are taking a toll. . \"The game is fun but completely overshadowed by the technical issues, which have been here since day one,\" says Sol FamilyGuy. That points to another refrain, which is that players are exasperated that the technical issues in Wilds have persisted for so…",

Exactly how many GPUs AMD will sell to OpenAI isn't clear, but the announcement says that if the arrangement comes fully to fruition, OpenAI will be running fully 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Intriguingly, the deal also includes OpenAI taking an up to 10% equity stake in AMD. The first 1 gigawatt tranche kicks off in the second half of next year based on AMD's next-gen Instinct MI450 AI GPU. At the same time, OpenAI will acquire the first segment of up to 160 million AMD shares. If the deal progresses right through to the final 6 gigawatt GPU power figure, OpenAI will by then have bought 160 million AMD shares accounting for roughly 10% of the company. At current values, that would be a $26 billion investment. So, it's a megabucks deal all round. It also the first really big AI GPU win of this kind for AMD, at least that we are aware of. It looks like it's big news too for the markets, as AMD's share price rocketed up 35% on the news during early trading . Kerching!

But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems, helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn’t last long.

Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\".

So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",

Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour.

Yet while updates remained relatively consistent through last year, 2025 has been much more sporadic, with no updates in the last nine months. That's changed now, however, as Slavic Magic has finally released a new experimental beta for Manor Lords, one that brings an impressive array of new features to the city-builder. The beta patch expands the scope of Manor Lords in several directions. It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm. It also adds a new masonry-themed production chain that lets players fashion stone and mortar through building a quarry, stonemason and lime kiln.

    "body": "You can't go wrong with an airship, that's what I say! Well, apart from that one time when things went very wrong with an airship. Historically wrong, some might claim. Ahem. But at least I can confidently state that all the best videogames have airships in them, like everyone's favourite Final Fantasy, 12 , the third best Bioshock game , and, er, middling survival sim Forever Skies . Look, I just like airships, okay? Let me have this, please . Chill city-builder and definitely not a strategy game Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles already features airships in abundance, which by my admittedly unusual metric makes it the best videogame ever made. But where do you go once you've ascended to the zenith of creative expression? The answer, of course, is bigger airship . Ginormous blimps are the headline feature of Bulwark's latest update , which introduces the biggest balloon yet seen in Tomas Sala's gentle game of mountain fortification management. The Behemoth is a vast, heavily armed aerial flagship with three different upgrade tiers that players can acquire as they explore Bulwark's lofty world. Players can find this flying fortress by tracking down the \"Master of Ammunitions\" located …",

    "body": "I always figured I'd shoot for a pure sorcery build in the unlikely event I found a spare 140 hours to play Elden Ring again, given my run of any FromSoft game always devolves into paddling bosses with the biggest sword I can find. I may need to change these (highly theoretical) plans, however, as some three-finger-frenzied modding wizard has added a complete Witcher moveset into Miyazaki's magnum opus. Created by modder therealsqueam, the simply titled Witcher—Moveset Mod lets you get your Geralt on in The Lands Between by adding a full fighting style inspired by Andrzej Sapkowski's monster hunters into the game. It also adds the ability to cast signs, and even incorporates Geralt-style fisticuffs just in case you're caught without your weapon drawn. Chiefly, the mod replaces Milady and Leda's swords with blades of steel and silver, typically wielded by Witchers, both of which can be purchased from Merchant Kalé in Limgrave. The steel sword naturally scales with dexterity, while the silver sword dishes out big holy damage, making it ideal for dealing with undead creatures. Both swords use the same moveset, which borrows heavily from the acrobatic combat techniques seen in The Wit…",
