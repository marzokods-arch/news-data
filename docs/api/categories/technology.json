For your second phase of Expedition prep, building whatever the hell that thing is the game has you gathering materials for, you'll need five cooling fans.

Larian publishing director Michael Douse, who took to X to take a swipe at Steam's rivals. \"It's almost as if it isn't providing a shit service defined by public shareholder KPIs [Key Performance Indicators],\" wrote Douse. The man has a point. Valve stands apart from its competition in being a private company. That is to say, it's not traded on a stock exchange and it doesn't have shareholders whispering in its ear demanding it chase whatever short-term trend is currently driving up share prices. Unlike Epic, Amazon, Ubisoft, or EA (though, uh, I suppose that last one's set to change ), Valve only really has to answer to its president, Gabe Newell, and he's busy buying yacht companies . Indeed, in an alternate universe where Valve does have a cabal of pension funds and who-knows-what else setting its direction, we'd probably already have some sort of dreadful AI chatbot integrated…",

So you're not stumbling around and increasing your odds of getting gunned down every second you waste, here are the four locations you need to check to complete Life of a Pharmacist. I'll note that since you don't need to extract anything, using a free loadout isn't a bad idea. How to complete Life of a Pharmacist in Arc Raiders You need to 'document' the pharmacist's family, skills, hobbies, and taste to complete Life of a Pharmacist, which is cryptic as far as quest objectives go. As demonstrated in the video above, head to the Arbusto Farmacia pharmacy in Piazza Arbusto near the centre of Buried City and go upstairs.

Arc Raiders has been on a monumental run since it launched a couple of weeks back. Hitting 100,000 concurrent players in just 30 minutes and briefly surpassing Battlefield 6 in concurrent players a few days ago, it seems like the gaming world has been enamoured with Embark's new extraction shooter, and I can't see the enthusiasm waning anytime soon. (Image credit: Embark) Just 14 hours ago, at the time of writing, Arc Raiders managed to hit another milestone: overtaking Helldivers 2 in all-time peak of concurrent players, reaching 462,488 or 462,485, plus my two friends and I. Helldivers 2, in contrast, has an all-time peak of just 458,709 , and that's including my squad. This milestone puts into context just how popular Arc Raiders is, and how quickly it's managed to rise up to sit comfortably with some of the biggest releases in the last few years, let alone 2025, which was a pretty strong year for shooters. But it's not always all about concurrent p…",

Our only solace seems to be other developers picking up the torch of those big, cinematic, ensemble cast, wish fulfilling RPGs: Larian, CDProjekt, and now, maybe Owlcat with its distinctly Mass Effect-y upcoming take on the Expanse, Osiris Reborn. On November 7, Owlcat shared the game's main theme from composer Paweł Perepelica, who previously scored Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader for the studio. It's hard get crazy excited about music from an upcoming game, but Osiris Reborn's main theme kinda goes. That combination of a very space opera, orchestral sound with more cyberpunk synths puts me right back in that 2007, saving the galaxy headspace. It doesn't hurt that Mass Effect and The Expanse draw from the same well of gritty, '90s and aughts, military-inflected, Sci-Fi Syfy Channel sci-fi⁠—even if Mass Effect tempered it with a more wide eyed, mid-20th century sensibility.

After debuting as a captain of the Ultramarines in the first Space Marine, he was busted down to lieutenant for the sequel, and as we see in the trailer has now regained his former title. As of this promotion he's captain of the Second Company in place of Acheran, the guy in Space Marine 2 who constantly tells you he can only spare three men. Maybe that's why Acheran was demoted, although it's more likely he's dead or in a dreadnought. I'm sure we'll find out later. With that new rank comes a new responsibility.

    "body": "Rory Norris, Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: making friends with every raider over a mutual hunt for lemons in Arc Raiders. This week I've been: continuing to team up with players in Arc Raiders, and blasting the mean ones. As much as I love the nail-biting tension of extraction shooters, it's long been a genre obsessed with a rigorous gear grind and slow pace that make it almost impenetrable for new players, or those that can't dedicate more than a few hours a day or even a week. The one exception to this until now has been Hunt: Showdown , and while I can't recommend it enough, let's face it, it's not your typical extraction shooter. So, for all these years, the extraction shooter has remained the dominion of a select few with enough time and patience to dedicate to it—and invariably trounce anyone who dares to give it a casual go. Of course, with enough time and determination, you'll eventually join that elite band, but my point is that the genre isn't known for being welcoming and even semi-casual. If you want a genre to truly grow and experiment, encouraging a more diverse audience will do it. Just as I thought perhaps the genre would never become truly …",

Sure, Helldivers 2 deserves its success, but Extermination's developer, Offworld, must be a little green watching Arrowhead's bug-blasting, fascist lampooning sci-fi action game gallivant off with all of the money. Hence, it would only be fair for Offworld to copy Arrowhead's homework a little, which appears to be the case for the cooperative spinoff's latest update. Update 1.8 will primarily introduce a Company progression system to Extermination when it arrives later in November. But I'm more intrigued by its tertiary feature—in-game airstrikes. Now, these work a little differently from Helldivers 2's airstrikes. Where Arrowhead's game lets you deploy them as a Stratagem, they form a side-mission in Extermination, something you can take on alongside the primary objective of building/defending your base. Specifically, players must defend new objectives called Fleet Relays out in the field, successfully doing which…",

As one effect, the screenshots on Steam store pages can now be displayed at a higher resolution, and there are new theater and full-screen browsing modes for images and trailers.
