    "body": "On Monday, news broke that EA, one of the world's largest publicly-traded game publishers, is being taken private in a $55 billion leveraged buyout funded by a group of investors including Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners private equity firm and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock. But public companies have their disadvantages, too—particularly for consumers in creative and entertainment industries. Shareholder primacy, the theory that deliveri…",

In an announcement reminiscent of Phil Spencer's comments about how great things are looking at Xbox as the company laid off 9,000 people , the Xbox team said \"creator participation and player engagement in Game Pass are at an all-time high.\" But, it continued, \"we have the opportunity for Game Pass to help more players find the creators and games they love.\" \"We know not everyone wants the same thing in their Xbox experience, so we’re evolving Game Pass to offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players, whether you love day one releases, discovering hidden gems, or playing across multiple devices and screens and across Xbox consoles, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud.\" That evolution means two things.

So I was pretty interested in Hotel Barcelona, a 2.5D action roguelite that emerged—like Athena from Zeus' skull—from a hot collabo between the two creators. And then I stopped being quite so interested: reviews weren't great—the game currently stands at a 56% Mixed user rating on Steam, and critics weren't in love with it either. Now, in another blow to my interest Hotel Barcelona has updated its Steam page to feature an AI disclaimer. The disclaimer bashfully admits that \"VHS tapes can be found in the late stages of the game that use voice overs from an AI text to speech service\" and that \"A logo is featured on these tapes that has utilised generative fill AI to complete the image.\" In an update published earlier today , Hotel Barcelona publisher CULT seemed pretty abashed by the wh…",

With the likes of TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor fabrication company) being based there, it's right at the centre of the global chip trade. With America also looking to regain a slice of that technological pie, that has led to some chatter about potential deals between the two countries. As reported by Reuters , US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told News Nation (a US-based television network) that it would be proposing a 50/50 split with Taiwan for future chip production. In this, the US government wants Taiwan to move 50% of the chips it produces for US use to be made in the US. TSMC has fabs in America, newly-built ones with plans for more, but they don't make up anywhere near as much of global production as its facilities in Taiwan. This proposed deal would try to push for commitment to a huge increase in production on US soil. Cheng Li-chiun, a Taiwanese politician and vice premier, told reporters, \"Our negotiating team has never made any commitment to a 50/50 split on chips. Rest assured, we did not discuss this issue during this round of talks, nor would we agree to such c…",

    "body": "Turns out there are downsides to feeding your likeness into an AI-powered text-to-video generator. One totally predictable drawback is the userbase wrestling away control of your likeness to create deepfakes of your digital double doing crimes. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's likeness is all over the announcement video for Sora 2's launch. The trailer in question was itself made entirely in Sora 2, situating Altman in an AI-generated studio, an impossible neon-coloured forest, and even an oversized duck racing event. However, the most popular AI-generated clip on the Sora app right now is reportedly a fabricated surveillance video showing Sam Altman stealing graphics cards, according to OpenAI researcher Gabriel Petersson . The latest Sora model launched today alongside a dedicated app , with its key social pitch being features that allow you to remix your friends' creations and upload your own likeness into AI-generated videos. Altman claims there are in-app mitigations against the misuse of someone's likeness. However, I think the clip where his digital double can be heard saying, \"Please, I really need this for Sora inference—this video is too good,\" as he clutches a graphics card spea…",

    "body": "Dear reader, I have a confession to make: I never really got into Minecraft. Sure, I dabbled—but then I'd turn around to see the literal cathedrals folks were building with their blocks and I simply decided to go play something else. We're not all destined to be architects, and I'm more than okay with that. Throw in a bit of redstone, and I'm happy observing others' creativity safely within the confines of my hardware writing lane. One YouTuber called sammyuri has shared an especially extreme Redstone build, building ChatGPT in Minecraft (via Techspot ). Dubbed CraftGPT, this version of the Large Language Model is decidedly compact as far as these things go, featuring only about 5 million parameters (as that's all the creator's \"poor old laptop\" could handle). However, translating that into Minecraft blocks took up a considerable amount of space. Featuring 439 million blocks, this build required the Distant Horizons mod to keep everything on screen and operational. Beyond that, sammyuri claims that this build was made using only vanilla Minecraft's own redstone mechanics. Built over many months, I find that's a creative use of time still preferable to all the hours I spend doomscr…",

Well, the famous battery brand is now being emblazoned on a productivity laptop, and unsurprisingly, the battery is absolutely massive. As reported by The Verge , three laptops are launching under the Energizer name, each designed by Avenir Telecom, a French communications company: The Energizer EnergyBook Pro 15, the EnergyBook Pro XL 19, and the Energizer EnergyBook Pro Ultra. The last is considered the flagship model and comes with a whopping 18-inch display (with a 1920 x 1200 resolution). The Pro Ultra comes with a 192 Wh battery. For context on this figure, of all the batteries we've tested lately, the absolute max capacity we've found is 175 Wh on the likes of the Acer Predator Helios 18 AI or Razer Blade 16 . Both of these laptops have RTX 5090s and cost thousands of dollars. Those bigger batteries are an attempt to get normal battery life out of high-end hardware. The Pro Ultra, however, comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, and 512 GB of SSD storage. You don't need a huge battery to get decent battery life…",

At first I thought it was the fact I hadn't touched Wilds in a few months and I was rusty as hell—tunnel-visioning in on my Hunting Horn songs and eating just about every damn hit I could—but it turns out Omega Planetes is actually just kinda freaking hard. Taking a look on the Monster Hunter subreddit today, I was met with a plethora of posts ranging from players encouraging one another to \" lock in ,\" to folk lamenting just how big a difficulty spike Omega Planetes really is. Thanks, I hate it from r/MHWilds \"Just tried to solo this thing and uh… that's the first time I ever failed a mission solo,\" one post titled Omega Planetes got hands reads. \"This guy is tough.\" One of the top comments calls it \"the hardest fight in the game for a solo player,\" while another sa ys, \"I was waiting for something hard, but DARK SOULS????\" One of the top Omega Planetes-related posts on the subreddit right now simply says \" Thanks, I hat…",
