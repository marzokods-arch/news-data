That's the only explanation I've landed on for why Chained Together , an ultra-hard co-op platformer about four characters being, well, chained together, is getting a film adaptation. Yet, here we are. The film, as reported by Deadline , is being developed by Anton, the production group behind the 2020 film Greenland , and writers Cory Todd Hughes and Adrian Speckert. Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage . It has felt for a while now that being based on videogames is the entire point of these films, and whether a given game lends itself to film as a medium is tertiary. It seems…",

Steam achievement data shows that 39% of players have earned more than 1 million in loot value, and 16.5% have safely descended the elevator and/or subway back to Speranza more than 100 times. Embark Studios has a hit on its hands, but the community is figuring out the game quickly. In the first week, the Arc were seen as fearsome, clever threats. In the second week, I was seeing players surf them for sport and dunk on them with creative zipline/mine techniques . We know the roadmap has a snowfall map condition and some new quests in store in December, but it's going to take a lot to keep up with this hungry playerbase in 2026. Here are some ideas for expansion that we think Arc Raiders would benefit from: (Image credit: Embark Studios) Meaningful Expeditions Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer : So far, Arc Raiders has done a brilliant job of making each run feel meaningful, whether through quests, map modifiers, or the big events like breaking open Stella Montis, but currently it feels like we're lacking in some form of meta progression.

My favourite weapon so far, though, has to be the Stitcher; it's a breeze to use against other players. Until now, it's largely been a 'vibe' thing for me. Simply put, I like the way the Stitcher, Ferro, and Anvil feel compared to competition like the Kettle, Arpeggio, and Torrente, among others. And that's lucky for me now that I've seen the maths behind it all. Content creator ' Min Max Lab ', who's been doing a bunch of excellent Arc Raiders science experiments lately, has worked out the efficiency of the most common and popular weapons by weighing up their max durability, how much is lost per shot, and how expensive each one is to repair. As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot. This demolishes the Rattler IV's average 11,900 damage per gun at 3.9 credits per shot. There's a noticeab…",

It shows you visually and interactively exactly where different motherboards have different PCIe lanes routed. Apart from how many VRMs it has and how many I/O ports it has, probably the most important thing to consider with a motherboard is how many PCIe lanes it has routed to different areas. This is particularly important when you expect to use multiple storage devices or expansion cards. PCIe lanes are what your different components use to communicate with each other—they're physical, embedded routes that run through your motherboard.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology can therefore be \"converted\" into compute shader code.…",

While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only .

In a press release (via Engadget ), TikTok stated that the app's \"manage topics\" section will be expanded with a new toggle \"in the coming weeks\". This toggle will apparently help \"dial things down\" for people who don't want their feed clogged up with AI slop, though TikTok says the toggle is designed to \"tailor\" the range of videos in a feed \"rather than removing or replacing content in feeds entirely.\" Hence, it sounds like you won't be able to opt out of seeing AI slop completely, only choose to see less of it. This toggle will be joined by a new \"invisible watermarking\" feature for TikTok's own AI-infused editing tools and \"content uploaded with C2PA Content Credentials.\" TikTok already requires users who post \"realistic\" AI generated content to label it appropriately, in part using those C2PA Credentials which embed metadata to…",

I've been testing gaming chairs for over eight years. Everything from noted gaming brands such as Secretlab and Noblechairs, to office maestros such as Herman Miller. In that time, gaming chairs have gone from the butt of the joke to the de facto furniture for people to play PC games on. There's a good reason for that. The quality of gaming chairs has, generally, increased. Though not every manufacturer got the memo. There's still a lot of junk out there. If you simply want to know which gaming chair is no.1 right now, I keep a carefully curated list of the best gaming chairs . However, for this article I'm going to run down what I look out for in a gaming chair when judging its worthiness, and the advice I wish I'd had before I ever started sitting my butt on these things professionally.

The entire mission consists of two small tasks: finding a flag in a Raider outpost, and hoisting said flag above said outpost. Doing this gets you the Aviator outfit (that one with the headphones), so it's well worth the time. In this quest, Celeste asks you to head to the Formicai Outpost on Dam Battlegrounds to do your flag waving. Finding the flag is pretty straightforward, but you might be struggling with where to hoist it. Either way, I'll run through the whole A Symbol of Unification quest below. Since you're not extracting anything, it might be worth bringing a free loadout , especially as the trek to Formicai can be quite long if you get an inconvenient spawn.

Up front and literally in bold, he kicks off with the following statement: \"The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack or malicious activity of any kind.\" He follows that up with an entirely caveat-free apology. \"We are sorry for the impact to our customers and to the Internet in general.
