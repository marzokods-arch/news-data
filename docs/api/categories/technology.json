The publisher, Humble Games, still technically exists, but it's dormant, with a website that proudly announces the launch of Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus as if it happened yesterday, even though it released in July 2024. (The pay-what-you-want Humble Bundle store is still around; both it and the publisher are owned by media company Ziff Davis.) Things turned out relatively well for Bō, which has a \"Very Positive\" rating on Steam with over 1,000 user reviews and just got a big free update . But when Stair opened that matter-of-fact email in a Kyoto hotel room and learned that everyone he'd been relying on to manage the launch was no longer employed, the stress was tremendous.

Everything's all crunchy and dithered, but the art and assets are clearly gorgeous and well-crafted underneath⁠—we're very deliberately lo-fi here, not just 'cuz. In addition to the genre-standard medieval/renaissance gear and guys, Queen's Domain zags a bit by setting the game on a tropical island, with ancient, mossy stone ruins that call to mind Mayan cities or, in videogame speak, the Ruins of Rauh from Elden Ring.

Instead of basking in the glory of its first post- Baldur's Gate 3 project, revealed at The Game Awards as Divinity , the studio has been dealing with the ugly aftermath of Vincke's comments about the use of generative AI at Larian. In a new effort to set the record straight, Vincke said today that Larian will hold an AMA in the new year, giving gamers an opportunity to learn more about how developers at Larian actually get things done. Larian's AI controversy erupted earlier this week in the wake of a Bloomberg interview in which Vincke touched on some of the ways developers at the studio are making use of generative AI tools. He made clear that the studio isn't using generative AI for any in-game content, like art, writing, or voices, but that did little good: The backlash against what was perceived as Larian's pro-AI stance was immediate and fierce. Vincke tried to smooth things out with a subsequent post on X in which he was more specific about how exactly Larian developers use generative AI, but that did not satisfy many of the studio's fans.

The change comes as part of what appears to be a shakeup of gaming efforts at Hasbro, which has brought in industry veteran Paul Della Bitta to head up Wizards of the Coast's Digital Ventures division. Della Bitta spent 10 years across two stints at Blizzard, as well as two years as general manager of Riot Games in North America. More recently, he was a co-founder of Dreamhaven , the developer and publisher headed up by former Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime. But it's the departure of Ohlen that strikes me as the most notable development here, at least from a gamer's perspective. A 22-year BioWare veteran with lead design and director credits on everything from the original Baldur's Gate to Anthem, Ohlen took the wheel of a then-unnamed new development studio at Wizards of the Coast in 2019; Exodus, the studio's first project, was revealed at The Game Awards in 2023 .

Maybe that's the best compromise: Blueprints have felt pretty stingy in Arc Raiders since launch. I've played for nearly 50 hours and haven't managed to find more than seven—to be fair, I'm not looking all that hard, but it's strange that other rare loot (like fancy guns and gadgets) are significantly easier to find than the blueprint for items that aren't even that good, like muzzle brakes. That was probably the aim of raising drop rates in the first place, though Embark never actually confirmed it raised them in the first place until today's hotfix.

That's definitely not great news when some estimate the number of data centres will triple by 2030. According to a report from Rest of World , the optimal temperature range for a data centre lies between 18 °C and 27 °C (or 64.4 °F and 80.6 °F). However, of the 8,808 data centres in operation, 7,000 have been built in places that typically experience a climate outside of this range. Furthermore, 600 (or about 10% of all data centres) have been built in places that regularly breach that temperate 27 °C ceiling (via Tom's Hardware ). Data centres are already power hungry, collectively hoovering up 1.5% of the world's total electricity consumption (or 415 terawatt hours) in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency . However, add to that a cooling system that's having to fight against the everyday climate it finds itself in, and that potentially adds up to an even greater strain on the local grid.

MSI's Prestige laptops, in both 14- and 16-inch formats, and ranging from roughly 2,000 Euros to 2,500 Euros, or about $2,300 to $3,000, appeared on a French etailer , though it's far from clear if the pricing is final. All of the various models were listed with 32 GB of RAM, which is notable given the ongoing RAMpocolypse . But perhaps the most interesting are the variants with Panther Lake 'X' chips. That includes the Intel Core Ultra X7 358H and the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H. Both of those chips get the big Panther Lake CPU die, making for a total of four Performance, eight Efficient, and four low-power Efficient CPU cores. The 'X' prefix is the really intriguing bit, however, and is thought to refer to Panther Lake SKUs with the larger GPU chiplet containing 12 Xe3 GPU cores.

Parent company Monotype Imaging, which bought Fontworks back in 2023, then introduced a new pricing structure costing easily fifty times as much as the old plan (via Automaton ). US-owned Monotype's pricing structure initially offered no local pricing for Japan, but still expected devs to cough up $20,500 per year, in addition to agreeing to a ridiculous 25,000-user cap on games using the licensed fonts. Thankfully, the parent company has backpedalled a bit since, allowing developers to extend their licenses under the old affordable plan for the time being.

In this puzzle metroidvania, the hero (let's just call them Ö from now on) can't really do much except explode those bombs. There is no jumping, no mantling, no attacking, no nothing, unless it can be achieved via the detonation of a bomb. When Ö starts with one bomb things seem simple enough: to jump, I spawn a bomb beneath myself and detonate. If I place a bomb and stand to the left of it before detonating, I'll be propelled leftward, which can be useful to clear a pit. Eventually Ö gets a second bomb, which offers a little more manoeuvrability while further complicating the puzzles. All this points to a clever but by no means revelatory puzzle game.

While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build.
