The deluge was the result of a potent atmospheric river that took aim at the region starting around December 7. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow bands of moisture that move like rivers in the sky, transporting water vapor from the tropics toward the poles. They occur around the planet, most often in autumn and winter, with the U.S. West Coast typically affected by moist air that originates near Hawaii. In this event, however, some of the moisture arrived from even farther away, originating roughly 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) across the Pacific from near the Philippines . This map shows the total precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere at 11:30 p.m. P…",

The proposed CINEMA mission aims to advance our understanding of how plasma energy flows into the Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere. This highly dynamic convective flow is unpredictable — sometimes steady and sometimes explosive — driving phenomena like fast plasma jets, global electrical current systems, and spectacular auroral displays. “The CINEMA mission will help us to research magnetic convection in Earth’s magnetosphere — a critical piece of the puzzle in understanding why some space weather events are so influential, such as causing magnificent aurora displays and impacts to ground- and space-based infrastructure, and others seem to fizzle out,” said Joe Westlake, director…",

Earlier today, OpenAI announced a major deal with Disney that will allow ChatGPT and Sora to create officially licensed, AI-generated imagery featuring the media giant’s popular characters. Now, Disney wants to stop another leading AI provider from doing the same. Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, accusing the company of copyright infringement in Gemini output. Variety reports that in a letter reviewed by the publication, Disney’s lawyers accuse Google of infringing on Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale,” citing Gemini’s ability to create imagery that includes copyrighted characters from across Disney’s expansive catalog of intellectual properties. Disney has apparently been informally communicating with Google about this for some time, but as of today, Gemini still readily produces imagery featuring Disney’s characters.",

A selection of Sora-generated video content is coming to the Disney+ app. The deal will see Disney purchase equity in OpenAI, making it part owner. Disney has been pretty litigious when it comes to AI platforms appropriating its intellectual property. In June, the company sued AI image generator Midjourney , seeking to stop the platform from creating images using characters from its IPs. Then, in September, it sent a cease-and-desist to AI chatbot provider Character.AI, again citing the platform’s unauthorized use of its characters. But now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has announced that its products will soon be able to create images and videos of all your favorite Disney characters — with Disney’s blessing. OpenAI detailed the arrangement in a blog post this morning. Disney and OpenAI are partnering up to allow both ChatGPT Images and Sora to generate content containing characters, props, locations, and more from Disney’s vast IP empire, which includes Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, beginning early next year.",

Like a toddler, our Sun occasionally has disruptive outbursts. But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "summary": "Like other foldables, the Galaxy Z TriFold lets you transition apps from the cover to the main screen, but there’s a catch.",
    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

Starting January 20, 2026, anyone who buys a qualifying DRM-free title will be able to download an EPUB or PDF version from their Amazon account. The change was quietly announced in Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing documentation , and it marks the first time in years that the company has offered a sanctioned path to download Kindle content outside its walled garden. It’s also a sharp contrast to Amazon’s decision in early 2025 to remove the long-standing Download &amp; Transfer via USB option, a shift that did not go over well with the brand’s power users.",

Samsung appears so confident of its effects that it also wants to sell it to clients such as Qualcomm. If that works out, we might see it being used on the rumored special version of Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Samsung’s Exynos chipsets have been relentlessly criticized and trolled for their heating issues. The poor heat management on Exynos chips has also contributed to throttling and their inability to sustain high performance for long enough, which has traditionally made them less desirable than Snapdragon-branded counterparts. But Samsung has refused to abandon that ship, and might have actually addressed it with the upcoming Exynos 2600, which could power some of the Galaxy S26 models in certain regions. Not just Samsung appears so confident in its solution that it’s ready to offer it to other companies, including Apple and Qualcomm. According to a recent report by the Korean outlet ET News , Samsung has formally announced its technology to address heat-related throttling issues on chipsets.

    "summary": "Android 17 could let your preferred home screen launcher lock apps behind a passcode or biometrics.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google may be working on a native App Lock feature for Android 17 that lets users secure specific apps without the restrictions of Private Space. This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Google could be testing an AI chatbot for Discover that would allow users to customize their feed through conversation. Evidence found in the Google app shows a pop-up warning about “discarding conversation” when changing settings. The feature mirrors a recent YouTube experiment but is currently incomplete, with no input box actually available yet. YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next. The twist, though, is that this ability is facilitated through an AI chatbot that users must interact with by entering prompts. While it’s unclear whether YouTube will graduate this experiment into a permanent feature, it seems Google may be looking to bring this AI chatbot-powered custom feed to Discover as well.
