    "body": "On Thursday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT users can now branch conversations into multiple parallel threads, serving as a useful reminder that AI chatbots aren't people with fixed viewpoints but rather malleable tools you can rewind and redirect. The company released the feature for all logged-in web users following years of user requests for the capability. The feature works by letting users hover over any message in a ChatGPT conversation, click \"More actions,\" and select \"Branch in new chat.\" This creates a new conversation thread that includes all the conversation history up to that specific point, while preserving the original conversation intact. Think of it almost like creating a new copy of a \"document\" to edit while keeping the original version safe—except that \"document\" is an ongoing AI conversation with all its accumulated context. For example, a marketing team brainstorming ad copy can now create separate branches to test a formal tone, a humorous approach, or an entirely different strategy—all stemming from the same initial setup.

Now, though, a developer on Star Wars Outlaws is saying that a technical limitation of the Switch 2's Game Card interface may be driving some publishers away from fully physical game releases on the Switch 2. Writing in a Bluesky thread discussing the performance of the Outlaws' Switch 2 port [which is only available as a download or Game Key Card], Snowdrop Audio Architect Rob Bantin chimed in to discuss why a full physical release wasn't in the cards for the Switch 2. \"Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for,\" Bantin wrote. \"I think if we’d designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we’d build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case, I think our leadership made the right call.\" Read full article Comments",

Users could type simple commands like \"10 PRINT 'HELLO'\" and \"20 GOTO 10\" to create an endless loop of text on their screens, for example—often their first taste of controlling a computer directly. The interpreter translated these human-readable commands into instructions that the processor could execute, one line at a time. Read full article Comments",

Although Honda has varied the ingredients over the years, the recipe for the Prelude remains the same: a sleek coupe body and some cutting-edge technology under the skin, like four-wheel steering , as rhapsodized by the verbose but usually insightful motoring writer LJK Setright. Today, the new car broke cover ahead of its arrival in showrooms later this fall. It's a handsome shape, though I can't quite get over the resemblance to the Toyota Prius , at least as far as the nose of the car is concerned. Then again, I'm on record as adoring the shape of the current Prius—did you know its windshield is more steeply raked than a Lamborghini Huracan ? But from other angles, the Prelude is more unique. The proportions are low and wide, with some details that signal its sportiness and others that suggest a focus on reducing drag and maximizing efficiency. That makes sense when you know what's under the hood. It's the same 2.0 L Atkinson cycle engine and hybrid system from the Honda Civic, which, in the right hands, is capable of up to 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km).

For people who have stayed away from the Hue lineup because of high prices, the most important addition to the lineup is the new Hue Essential bulbs. These bulbs can't dim as low as the flagship Hue bulbs and don't support as wide a range of colors or white levels, but the standard A19/E26 versions are available for $25 per bulb individually or as low as $15 a bulb when bought in a four-pack, somewhere between one-half and one-quarter the typical price of a Hue bulb.

How about the first time two boosters landed side by side, punctuating the inaugural launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket with thrilling synchrony? Some of SpaceX's most defining moments happened on a piece of beachfront property at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This is where SpaceX first landed a reusable Falcon 9 booster coming back from space and, a few years later, landed two boosters side by side. In all, SpaceX has landed 66 Falcon boosters at Landing Zones 1 and 2 since recovering the first Falcon 9 booster on December 21, 2015 . Now, SpaceX is preparing to hand the landing zones back to the US Space Force, which owns the property and has reallocated the real estate to two startup launch companies.

Ars Technica writers have encountered errors getting store pages to load, adding the game to an online shopping cart, and checking out once the game is part of the cart. That aligns with widespread social media complaints and data from DownDetector , which saw a sudden spike of over 11,000 reports of problems with Steam in the minutes following Silksong 's 10 am Eastern time release on Steam. The server problems don't seem to be completely stopping everyone, though, as SteamDB currently reports over 100,000 concurrent players for Silksong as of this writing. Ars also encountered some significant delays and/or outright errors when downloading other games and updates and syncing cloud saves on Steam during this morning's server problems. The Humble Store page for Silksong currently warns North American purchasers that \"We have run out of Steam keys for Hollow Knight: Silksong in your region, but more are on their way!

The model simultaneously generates RGB video and depth information to enable direct 3D reconstruction without the need for traditional modeling techniques. However, it won't be replacing video games anytime soon. The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space. Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting \"several minutes,\" according to Tencent. Objects stay in the same relative positions when the camera moves around them, and the perspective changes correctly as you would expect in a real 3D environment. While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes.

And second, to focus on \"direct-to-surface\" exploration, the White House sought to cancel the Lunar Gateway, a small space station intended to orbit the Moon. Essentially, for long-term sustainability, the White House decided it was best to use lower-cost, commercially available rockets and focus NASA's limited resources on surface activities. For example, the Gateway's $854 million budget in 2024 would be better spent in future years on a lunar base. Read full article Comments",
