That's essentially what's being suggested in a report by The Financial Times (via Reuters ), which claims that OpenAI has signed a deal with US semiconductor firm Broadcom to design and manufacture its own machine learning processors, for internal use next year. This is backed up by a statement from Broadcom's CEO, Hock Tan, who said that the company had secured $10 billion in AI system orders from a 'new customer', which should result in significant revenue growth in 2026. As things currently stand, OpenAI uses large-scale computer systems with Nvidia chips for AI model training and inference.

Now, though, with AI becoming increasingly able to beat Turing tests and the likes, it's increasingly important to be able to verify whether someone online is a person or a bot. So, lest we head towards a vindication of the dead internet theory , we also need increasingly more accurate methods for distinguishing neurons from silicon. This is no less true for gaming than anywhere else. Players using bots to cheat in online games is a real problem , and as AI gets more sophisticated, we can only assume the problem will get worse. Anti-cheats tackle this issue from one angle—checking program executables and so on—but another way of tackling it is to check that a user is a live person, a method that is often called 'liveness detection' or 'proof-of-human'.

Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed.
