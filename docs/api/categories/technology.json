    "body": "A battle over the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act (OSA) heated up Monday as UK regulator Ofcom fined the notorious image-hosting board 4chan about $26,000 for failing to provide a risk assessment detailing the potential harms of illegal content hosted on its forum. In a press release provided to Ars, Ofcom said 4chan refused to respond to two requests for information that the regulator considered \"routine.\" The first asked for the risk assessment and the second for 4chan's \"qualifying worldwide revenue.\" 4chan was anticipating the Monday fine, noting in a lawsuit —which was jointly filed with the online trolling forum Kiwi Farms in August and seeks to permanently enjoin Ofcom from enforcing OSA—that Ofcom had made it clear that because 4chan ignored Ofcom's emails, the fine was coming.

    "body": "Federal health agencies are reeling from mass layoffs on Friday that appear to have particularly devastated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite some terminations being rescinded on Saturday. Numbers are still sketchy, but reports from Friday indicate that more than 4,000 federal workers overall were initially targeted for layoffs. The Trump administration linked the firings to the ongoing government shutdown, which legal experts have suggested is illegal. Unions representing federal workers have already filed a lawsuit challenging the move. Of the reported 4,000 terminations, about 1,100 to 1,200 were among employees in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS is a massive department that houses critical federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, among others. Before Trump's second term, the HHS workforce was about 82,000, but that was slashed to about 62,000 earlier this year amid initial cuts and efforts to push civil servants out.

Storage space for a Ford truck key fob, which should fit any F-150 from model year 2018 onward. \"You can put your key fob in the buckle—all your remote features work while it’s in the buckle,\" designer Andy Andrews told the Detroit Free Press . \"Once you have it in there, you're not going to lose that key fob.

Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn't appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem.

Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners' cars by then.

All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship. While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be? In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible.

Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware . The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to …",

They should also be much safer, with nothing inside that can burn like those rare but hard-to-extinguish lithium-ion fires. They should hold a lot more energy, turning range anxiety into a distant memory with consumer EVs able to go four, five, six hundred miles on a single charge. And forget about those “fast” recharges lasting half an hour or more: Solid-state batteries promise EV fill-ups in minutes—almost as fast as any standard car gets with gasoline.

While the United States and China are launching more space missions than ever before, Russia's once-dominant launch cadence is on a downhill slide. Russia's access to global markets dried up after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The fallout from the invasion killed several key space partnerships between Russia and Europe.

Part of the MCU's Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton ( Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings ) and Andrew Guest ( Hawkeye ), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo ( Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a Wonder Man miniseries makes sense. Read full article Comments",

The scammers are able to recover multi-factor authentication codes by using adversary-in-the-middle tactics, which work by sitting between the victims and the site they think they’re logging in to, which is, in fact, a fake site operated by the attackers. Not all MFA is created equal The attackers then enter the intercepted credentials, including the MFA code, into the real site. This tactic, which has grown increasingly common in recent years, underscores the importance of adopting FIDO-compliant forms of MFA, which are immune to such attacks. Read full article Comments",

Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices.

Naturally, Google objects to this course of action. The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding \"yes.\" This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation. It simply means the company has \"substantial and entrenched market power\" in one or more areas under the purview of the CMA.
