Hellman notes that &#8220;there are now more artists generating over $100k/year from Spotify alone than were getting stocked on record store shelves at the height of the CD era,&#8221; but he says that &#8220;rampant misinformation&#8221; about streaming has led the public to distrust how successful and lucrative these services have been for musicians.

Android releases don’t move in a straight line, from ‘under development’ to ‘released’. Multiple versions of the operating system exist at the same time, at different stages of development, and are meant for completely different audiences.

Despite policies against sexual nudity, these apps were distributed through the app stores. Many of the apps generated significant revenue from in-app purchases, of which the platforms take as much as a 30% cut. Many of these apps were removed following the report, but several are still available for download. AI is one of the most powerful tools available these days, and you can do so much with it. But, like any tool, it can be used for good or bad . Over the past few weeks, we’ve witnessed social media users using X’s Grok AI chatbot in lewd ways, primarily to create sexualized imagery of women without their consent. As it turns out, it’s not just Grok that has been at the center of this undressing scandal, as both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store allegedly hosted “nudify” apps.

Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand.

Brighter blue areas indicate a higher density of dark matter. Researchers used Webb data to find the dark matter — which is invisible — via its gravitational influence on regular matter. The area of sky shown here is 0.54 square degrees (about 2½ times the size of the full Moon) and located in the constellation Sextans. Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) peered at this region for a total of about 255 hours. Dark matter doesn’t emit, reflect, absorb, or even block light, and is therefore not visible to the human eye or traditional telescopes. But it does interact with the universe through gravity, and large clumps or clusters of dark matter have enough mass to curve space itself. Light traveling to Earth from distant galaxies becomes sl…",

While something like Google Gemini can do a whole, whole lot for us without making us pay one extra dime , there are also people who are willing to pay a shocking amount of money for unfettered access to the best AI tools around. Between those extremes, Google’s AI Plus plan emerged as a nice balance of affordability and feature set — and now Google’s making it available to Gemini users everywhere.

Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

Now, looking outside our solar system, Webb has returned the first conclusive evidence that links how those conditions are possible. The telescope clearly showed for the first time that the hot, inner part of the disk of gas and dust surrounding a very young, actively forming star is where crystalline silicates are forged. Webb also revealed a strong outflow that is capable of carrying the crystals to the outer edges of this disk.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Apple just updated 10+ year-old devices to extend a digital certificate that keeps iMessage, FaceTime, and device setup working past 2027. Without this fix, these devices would slowly break. Once the certificate expired, they’d lose access to Apple’s servers and core features. The update is about functional life support, not new features; devices remain on old iOS 12 and many modern apps won’t work. Supporting a smartphone for more than a decade sounds almost impossible with how quickly new models come out these days, as in the case of Android models . But this week, Apple did just that by releasing a software update for iPhones that were first released more than 10 years ago. Apple has quietly released iOS 12.5.8, a surprise update for legacy hardware that can’t run modern versions of iOS, as spotted by a Reddit user . This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the original iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 and 3, and even the sixth-generation iPod touch.",

It’s also where I write all my posts for Android Authority , but it has honestly become more of a hassle than a solution. I needed a change. Something new. Something fresh. I wanted to ditch Notion because of its complexity and move to something designed around simplicity and focus. So, I switched to iA Writer , and I don’t think I’ll ever go back.",

However, since I need to stay updated on developments like this, I gritted my teeth and jumped in with both feet. My first AI browser, Arc Search , was surprisingly good. It was less a browser and more a souped-up search experience, but I did enjoy how it handled search queries. While I didn’t see it as a primary browser — it would never replace Firefox on my Android phone — I was disappointed when The Browser Company announced new things and left Arc behind.",

Google TV is in one of its slower seasons for major upgrades , but a recent software push rolling out now is quietly fixing some issues users have reported online.

The way it’s progressing, Google will soon know when your meeting is before you do. Back in October, it introduced the Help me schedule feature , which helped you suggest sensible meeting times based on your availability and the context of an email. That was useful, but it still left you to find out if the time worked for the other party. This latest update takes a bigger step by figuring out when everyone is actually free. According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar. When you’re creating an event, you’ll see a Suggested times option that uses Gemini to scan attendee availability, working hours, and existing conflicts, then surface the time slots that make the most sense for the whole group — assuming you have access to those calendars.

This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Some Pixel owners have complained that the Pixel Weather app offered seriously inaccurate forecasts during a recent snowstorm in North America. The app seemed to report much lower snowfall and higher temperatures than what actually occurred. The app’s AI weather report feature also made up a word, describing the day as “flurzy.” Google launched the Pixel Weather app back in 2024, and it’s a pretty neat and practical addition to Pixel phones . Unfortunately, many users have reported that the app offered woefully inaccurate weather forecasts in the wake of a recent snowstorm. Pixel owners have created numerous Reddit threads to report that the Pixel Weather app delivered incorrect weather forecasts during snowstorms in North America. More specifically, many owners report that the app reported much lower snowfall than what actually occurred.",

    "body": "At this point, it should probably be accepted as a universal fact that Siri is one of the weakest voice assistants in the world. That was true before its redesign in iOS 18, and it’s still true even after Apple added ChatGPT. The new smarts may have given Siri a new brain, but Siri still hasn’t figured out how to use that brain properly. We’ve collectively bullied Siri for years (rightfully so), to the point that Apple has now decided to partner with Google and base Siri on none other than its biggest — and far better — competitor, Gemini. There’s something deeply funny about a company using its rival’s underlying tech because it couldn’t quite build its own or find a better alternative.",
