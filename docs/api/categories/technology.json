Beaumont has also announced that \"cross-device play history\" will be coming, but that will be later this month. The main library aggregation update rolled out to Insiders a few months ago, but it looks like it's now being released to non-Insiders in regular updates. Those considering using aggregator apps like Playnite , in other words, might not need to do so anymore because they'll be able to use the Xbox app to view their entire game library, not just games bought on the Xbox app itself. This will \"show your installed games from multiple PC storefronts, including your Xbox library, Xbox Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts.\" Getting to those storefronts should be easier, too, as you can use the new 'My Apps' tab in your library to house Battle.net and so on.

The base price actually comes in at a piffling $3,600, but at the very least, you'd surely add the optional riser, a piece of CNC-machined wood that's yours for a mere $290 and adds three degrees of pitch. Cheap at twice the price. But how, exactly, does Norbauer & Co. contrive to offer such a pecunious PC peripheral? It's claimed to contain 682 custom parts.

As is the way with any Little Nightmares game, you won't be able to navigate this landscape without the threat of a horrifying monster watching your every move. This time though, rather than some bloodthirsty mannequins or an angry teacher with an unsettlingly long neck chasing you, you're being hunted by a giant, monster baby. Yep, that's right. Who needs a gentle introduction to the game with a smaller beast when you could have a giant baby on your tail instead? Throughout the demo you'll also get to play as the new protagonists, Low and Alone, both of whom boast different weapons you'll have to figure out how to use. For Low, that means a trusty bow which can be used to hit high targets or cut through ropes, whereas Alone relies on a heavy wrench perfect for smashing barriers or manipulating machines.

This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post.

    "body": "A trailer dropped today for Netflix's animated Splinter Cell show, and it's all guns and glory. Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

Taiwanese outlet CTEE claims that Nvidia will be the first to adopt TSMC's A16 node due to competition from AMD, in part for what it calls HPC or high performance chips built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node and due out this year. The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs . That's a physical limit on the size of an individual chip that can be etched onto a wafer. That physical size in turn puts a hard limit on how many transistors can be squeezed into a si…",
