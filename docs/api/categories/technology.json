The biggest multiplayer shooters of the moment cost money. Arc Raiders is $40, has no free trial, and it's a top seller. Battlefield 6 launched for $70 and instantly became the most successful game in the series (later adding a free-to-play battle royale mode). Both are raking it in, both are reviewing well, and both are being played more than several of the sturdiest free-to-play shooters on Steam. The numbers won't always look like that, but the wild successes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders prove an important point: people want to pay for great multiplayer shooters again.

By watching your favorite streamer play Arc Raiders (or by leaving a random stream playing in the bottom right-hand corner of your second monitor while you go about your day) you can unlock several small, free cosmetics. And that's not Arc Raiders' only promotion: there's also a Discord Quest waiting for you in your chat app. For both you'll have to link your Embark account with those services to claim the rewards. I'll quickly run through how to do that and what you can get from Twitch and Discord in Arc Raiders during the launch period. Connect Discord and Twitch to your Embark ID You'll likely have already linked your Steam, Epic or Xbox account to the Embark ID that Arc Raiders prompts you to create when you first start the game.

But as any seasoned scavenger knows, scrounging for scrap through the same old crates and cabinets can only satisfy for so long. Inevitably, even the most accomplished raider will yearn for more. And more is exactly what Embark Studios has planned. The studio just published its 2025 roadmap , giving us a preview of what new sights we can expect to see on our expeditions aboveground in the dwindling days of the year. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Throughout the remainder of 2025 we can expect ongoing additions of new map conditions, feats, trials, cosmetics, and quality of life improvements. In November the North Line update will bring the first beefy patch that'll make more substantial changes to the state of play. North Line's biggest addition will be the Stella Montis map, adding a new region of the Rust Belt that's currently, tantalizingly locked on the in-game world map. And to ensure we don't have too good of a time exploring the new area, the November update will also bring new Arc enemies: the Matriarch and the Shredder. I'm sure they're lovely.

Last week, however, that effort hit a hurdle: The Japanese Patent Office rejected one of Nintendo's pending patent applications as failing to demonstrate an \"inventive step\" that would differentiate it from prior art (via GamesFray ). While the patent application in question, JP 2024-031879 , isn't directly relevant to the Palworld lawsuit, it's related to patents that are: It's the child application of one of the patents asserted in Nintendo's accusations and is itself the parent application of another. The rejection, therefore, could give Pocketpair a rhetorical opportunity to encourage a similar investigation of the patents it's accused of infringing.

Well, luckily, Corsair has announced a new professional-looking fighter stick, and I can't wait to lose at my local tournament with it. The Novablade Pro Wireless has Hall effect magnetic switches, which not only ensure a longer shelf life but also allow custom actuation on the board. Keys can be set from anywhere to 0.1mm to 4mm, which means you can make surrounding keys a little harder to press and important ones easier to hit. Corsair says switches can be hit up to 150 million times, which is approximately three games for the average button basher. Speaking of button bashers, this fight controller has rapid trigger keys, which means they stop pressing the second you do. A more traditional switch starts and stops pressing at a certain actuation, which means you are losing milliseconds with each hit. That allows you to not only hit keys quicker, but also more often. Being wireless, it can be connected via Bluetooth, or connected to your rig in 2.4 GHz mode, offering lower latency th…",

Over the years, I've seen the scepticism from comments on my articles and reviews, various online discussion boards, and even friends and colleagues. So I'm here to defend what is, in my perhaps not-so-humble opinion, one of the best upgrades you can make if you're into shooters, which is using a lightweight wireless gaming mouse. I know a lot of gamers will read this and think duh , but this isn't for them; it's for those who are still clinging on to the familiar, like I was for so long. And such people do exist: I've seen them. Plenty of people won't give a lightweight mouse a real go, and some still won't try out wireless. Switching to a lightweight wireless gaming mouse has probably given me the biggest upgrade to my gaming experience I've had since I jumped from a 60 Hz to a 144 Hz monitor back in the day.

The idea seemed to spring out of discussions around the capabilities of the upcoming Tesla AI5 chip, which is said to be up to 40x faster than the current Tesla AI4 chip fitted to many of its cars (via Tom's Hardware ). Musk openly wondered if the upcoming chip \"might almost be too much intelligence for a car\", which led to his pitching of a concept he seems to have been rolling around for a while: \"One of the things I thought,\" said Musk, \"If we've got all of these cars that maybe are bored... we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet... if they're not actively driving\" \"At some point, if you've got 100 million cars in the fleet... and let's say they had, at the point, a kilowatt of inference capability... that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with cooling and power conversion taken care of.

I know what's really important, and it's that fashion is back, baby! Let's GO! Okay, now that I've caught my breath, here's the breaking news: In FF14, you can set glamour plates, similar to World of Warcraft's transmog system. This lets you overlay a preset outfit onto your character's gear, and like all MMOs, it's the true endgame. Let's be real, we're just here to play dress-up. We know what we are. There is one caveat, though—you can't glamour items meant for other classes or jobs onto your gear. So a set made for a Fisher can't be used on, say, Lancer equipment. That is, until mid-December of this year. As announced during the live letter, Patch 7.4 will allow players to glamour any piece of equipment, regardless of level of class restrictions, onto any other piece of equipment. No hooks, no catch—well, you can't do weapons, but that makes total sense given the animation nightmare of trying to turn a White Mage staff into a greatsword. It's otherwise a complete free-for-all.
