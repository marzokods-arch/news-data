And if you're wondering just how much Star Wars has been ingested by Bungie's design team, at various points in the video we see a character frozen in carbonite, off-brand AT-ST walkers stomping across the battlefield, and a Sarlacc pit on Mars (which is doubling for Tatooine). Of course there is also much twirling of light sabers. Watch it below: Regular readers may recall that I was pretty down on having a galaxy far, far away smeared all over my favourite-but-troubled looter shooter. Specifically: I did not want to cosplay as Darth Vader . However, having had a better look at how the crossover is being handled, I have to confess I'm kinda into it.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

What they found was a drop when moving over to the new Samsung memory, and gamers were quick to condemn the change. Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption. According to these tests the Samsung memory garnered temperatures 10°C lower than its SK Hynix counterpart, allowing for an almost 400 rpm drop in fan speeds. This means the S…",

Yet if you happened to bounce off the game because of its story—something I couldn't rightly blame you for—you might be surprised to find out that all of its DLC is… actually pretty good, all-told, and there's a lot of it. Four solidly-stacked campaigns you might've entirely missed. While Borderlands 3's insistently wonky plot is otherwise a real obstacle, all of these DLCs stick to a theme and largely nail it. None of these things are winning BAFTAs, mind, but they all spin enjoyable yarns. More importantly, they don't oscillate between outdated memes and unsuccessful melodrama—they just grab a solid pitch and run with it.

    "body": "Microsoft and the software reseller ValueLicensing have been going at each other for a while now, but the outcome of the latest trial that's starting up in the UK could have real ramifications on the second-hand software market. The Register reports that the trial, which starts today, will sit before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal and reminds us that the case \"has the potential to blow a hole in the European reselling market.\" That's because, according to the reseller, \"if Microsoft's argument is correct, it would mean that the entire resale market in Europe should not exist.\" Microsoft's argument is reportedly that it shouldn't have been legal for ValueLicensing to sell second-hand Windows or Office software because \"non-program copyright works\" [PDF] of the OS, such as the graphical user interface (GUI), are copyrighted and cannot be resold. This, unlike program copyright works, which seemingly can. The legal battle between the two companies didn't begin with this, though. It actually began in 2021 when ValueLicensing filed against Microsoft for £270 million, alleging that Microsoft had stifled competition in the software market. ValueLicensing claimed to have lost substanti…",

For a while, game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) has promised that this'll be changing in 8.0 , FF14's next expansion. Back in 2024, he stated: \"By strongly differentiating the jobs, we will be able to reach the goal we have set ourselves.\" It is now 2025, however, and a recent PCGamesN interview from Gamescom is casting doubt. As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.

Being a completionist, I intentionally got myself locked up early on to see what the fuss was about, so the advice below is written from that perspective.
