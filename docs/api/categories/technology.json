    "body": "Digital resilience—the ability to prevent, withstand, and recover from digital disruptions—has long been a strategic priority for enterprises. With the rise of agentic AI, the urgency for robust resilience is greater than ever. Agentic AI represents a new generation of autonomous systems capable of proactive planning, reasoning, and executing tasks with minimal human intervention. As these systems shift from experimental pilots to core elements of business operations, they offer new opportunities but also introduce new challenges when it comes to ensuring digital resilience. That’s because the autonomy, speed, and scale at which agentic AI operates can amplify the impact of even minor data inconsistencies, fragmentation, or security gaps. While global investment in AI is projected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025, fewer than half of business leaders are confident in their organization’s ability to maintain service continuity, security, and cost control during unexpected events. This lack of confidence, coupled with the profound complexity introduced by agentic AI’s autonomous decision-making and interaction with critical infrastructure, requires a reimagining of digital resilience. …",

We’re in the age of electricity Energy demand in general is going up around the world as populations increase and economies grow. But electricity is the star of the show, with demand projected to grow by 40% in the next 10 years. China has accounted for the bulk of electricity growth for the past 10 years, and that’s going to continue. But emerging economies outside China will be a much bigger piece of the pie going forward. And while advanced economies, including the US and Europe, have seen flat demand in the past decade, the rise of AI and data centers will cause demand to climb there as well. Air-conditioning …",

    "body": "Manufacturing is getting a major system upgrade. As AI amplifies existing technologies—like digital twins, the cloud, edge computing, and the industrial internet of things (IIoT)—it is enabling factory operations teams to shift from reactive, isolated problem-solving to proactive, systemwide optimization. Digital twins—physically accurate virtual representations of a piece of equipment, a production line, a process, or even an entire factory—allow workers to test, optimize, and contextualize complex, real-world environments. Manufacturers are using digital twins to simulate factory environments with pinpoint detail. DOWNLOAD THE REPORT “AI-powered digital twins mark a major evolution in the future of manufacturing, enabling real-time visualization of the entire production line, not just individual machines,” says Indranil Sircar, global chief technology officer for the manufacturing and mobility industry at Microsoft. “This is allowing manufacturers to move beyond isolated monitoring toward much wider insights.” A digital twin of a bottling line, for example, can integrate one-dimensional shop-floor telemetry, two-dimensional enterprise data, and three-dimensional immersive modeli…",

Comparisons of their results reveal that they systematically rank genes differently, and models have been developed to explain why. Ultimately, both methods are complementary, each highlighting distinct aspects of trait biology.",

    "body": "Training an AI model to predict equipment failures is an engineering achievement. But it&#8217;s not until prediction meets action—the moment that model successfully flags a malfunctioning machine—that true business transformation occurs. One technical milestone lives in a proof-of-concept deck; the other meaningfully contributes to the bottom line. Craig Partridge, senior director worldwide of Digital Next Advisory at HPE, believes &#8220;the true value of AI lies in inference”. Inference is where AI earns its keep. It’s the operational layer that puts all that training to use in real-world workflows. Partridge elaborates, &#8220;The phrase we use for this is &#8216;trusted AI inferencing at scale and in production,'&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we think the biggest return on AI investments will come from.&#8221; Getting to that point is difficult. Christian Reichenbach, worldwide digital advisor at HPE, points to findings from the company&#8217;s recent survey of 1,775 IT leaders: While nearly a quarter (22%) of organizations have now operationalized AI—up from 15% the previous year—the majority remain stuck in experimentation. Reaching the next stage requires a thr…",

The firm says the new model is better at reasoning, has more fluid multimodal capabilities (the ability to work across voice, text or images), and will work like an agent.&nbsp; The previous model, Gemini 2.5, supports multimodal input. Users can feed it images, handwriting, or voice. But it usually requires explicit instructions about the format the user wants back, and it defaults to plain text regardless.&nbsp; But Gemini 3 introduces what Google calls “generative interfaces,” which allow the model to make its own choices about what kind of output fits the prompt best, assembling visual layouts and dynamic views on its own instead of returning a block of text.&nbsp; Ask for travel recommendations and it may spin up a website-like interface inside the app, complete with modules, images, and follow-up prompts such as “How many days are you traveling?” or “What kinds of activities do you enjoy?” It also presents clickable options based on what you might want next.
