    "body": "Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.” Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.&nbsp; “The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornblu…",

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe .

    "body": "Ever since nuclear fusion was discovered in the 1930s, scientists have wondered if we could somehow replicate and harness the phenomenon behind starlight—the smashing together of hydrogen atoms to form helium and a stupendous amount of clean energy. Fusing hydrogen would yield 200 million times more energy than simply burning it. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers the world’s 440 atomic reactors, hydrogen fusion produces no harmful radiation, only neutrons that are captured and added back to the reaction. Instead of radioactive wastes with long, lethal half-lives, fusion’s by-product is helium, the most stable element—and a year’s worth from a fusion plant wouldn’t supply a party balloon business. Dennis Whyte’s part in the fusion quest began in graduate school, in a lab belonging to the electric utility Hydro-Québec, just outside Montreal. There he was shown a device built to replicate stellar fusion on an earthly scale. It was a doughnut-shaped hollow chamber, big enough for a lanky physicist like him to stand inside, based on a design conceived in 1950 by the future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, who also developed hydrogen bombs for the Soviet Union. It was call…",

Located in the basement of Building 26, the BioMaker Space welcomes novices and expert mentors alike, offering workshops in such things as bacterial photography, biobots, lateral flow assay, CRISPR, and DNA origami. For May, the makerspace has been a hub for collaboration. “I could never have done anything in that lab without my peers and counselors helping me, and the emphasis placed on teamwork is what makes the class feel both welcoming and exciting,” he says, adding that h…",

The presidential initiatives we’ve launched since fall 2024 are a vital part of our strategy to advance excellence within and across high-impact fields, from health care, climate, and education to AI and manufacturing—and now quantum. On December 8, we launched Quantum at MIT, or QMIT —the name rhymes with qubit , the basic unit of quantum information—to elevate MIT’s long-standing strengths in quantum science and engineering across computing, communication, and sensing. More than 40 years ago, MIT helped kick off what is widely considered the second quantum revolution as host of the first Physics of Computation Conference at Endicott House, bringing together physics and computing researchers to explore the promise of quantum computing. Now we’re investing further in that promise. Like all MIT’s strategic priorities, QMIT will help ensure that new technologies are used for the benefit of society.

    "body": "Nearly everyone has experienced it—after a night of poor sleep, your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention. A new MIT study reveals what happens biologically as these momentary lapses occur: Your brain is performing essential maintenance that it usually takes care of while you sleep. During a normal night of sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that cushions the brain helps flush away metabolic waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study , MIT electrical engineering and computer science professor Laura Lewis, PhD ’14, and colleagues showed that the CSF flows rhythmically in and out in a way that’s linked to changes in brain waves. To explore what might happen to this CSF flow in a sleep-deprived brain, Lewis, who is also a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and her colleagues tested 26 volunteers on several cognitive tasks after they’d been kept awake in the lab and when they were well-rested. Using both electroencephalograms and functional magnetic resonance imaging, the researchers measured heart rate, breathing rate, pupil diameter, blood oxygenation in the brain, and flow of CSF in and out o…",

    "body": "Earthquakes are driven by energy stored up in rocks over millennia—energy that, once released, we perceive mainly in the form of the ground’s shaking. But a quake also generates a flash of heat and fractures and damages underground rocks. And exactly how much energy goes into each of these three processes is exceedingly difficult to measure in the field. Now, with the help of carefully controlled miniature “lab quakes,” MIT geophysicist Matěj Peč and colleagues have quantified this so-called energy budget. Only about 1% to 10% of a lab quake’s energy causes physical shaking, they found, while 1% to 30% goes into breaking up rock and creating new surfaces. The vast majority heats up the area around a quake’s epicenter, producing a temperature spike that can actually melt surrounding material. The team also found that the fractions of quake energy producing heat, shaking, and rock fracturing can shift depending on the tectonic activity the region has experienced in the past. “The deformation history—essentially what the rock remembers—really influences how destructive an earthquake could be,” says postdoc Daniel Ortega-Arroyo, PhD ’25, lead author of a paper on the work. “That histo…",

    "body": "Lithium-ion batteries produce faint sounds as they charge, discharge, and degrade. But until now, nobody could interpret those sounds to detect when a battery might be about to lose power, fail, or burst into flames. Now, MIT engineers have found a way to do that, even with noisy data. The findings could provide the basis for relatively simple, totally passive, and nondestructive devices that could continuously monitor the health of battery systems like those in electric vehicles or grid-scale storage facilities. “Through some careful scientific work, our team has managed to decode the acoustic emissions,” says Martin Z. Bazant, a professor of chemical engineering and mathematics. They were able to classify them as coming from gas bubbles generated by side reactions or from fractures caused by expansion and contraction of the active material, two primary mechanisms of degradation and failure. The team coupled electrochemical testing of working batteries with recordings of their acoustic emissions, using signal processing to correlate sound characteristics with voltage and current. Then they took the batteries apart and studied them under an electron microscope to detect fracturing…",

To date, the technology has been limited by low voltage and scalability challenges. But the latest work by the MIT team that invented ec 3 has increased the energy storage capacity by an order of magnitude. With the improved technology, about five cubic meters of concrete—the volume of a typical basement wall—could store enough energy to meet the daily needs of the average home. A weight-bearing arch made of electron-conducting carbon concrete (ec 3 ) integrates supercapacitor electrodes to power a light.
