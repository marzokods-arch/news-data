    "body": "Late last year, Nightdive Studios released Blood: Refreshed Supply , its second remaster of Monolith Productions' brilliant FPS debut. For PC gamers with one Blood remaster already in their Steam library, the highlight of the package wasn't anything technical—it was the addition of the concluding part of one of Blood's best mods. That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could. But as he explains in a post on ModDB \"Responsibilities and life got in the way. As did a trickle of small issues.\" Still, it hasn't been that long since Blood: Refres…",

    "body": "Bloodborne on PC may still be the fevered dream of madmen, though some emulation warlocks have recently made strides bringing the nightmare to gaming's liquid-cooled Mensis cage. In any case, numerous game developers have strived to fill the PC's Yharnam-shaped game with their own derivations of FromSoft's Victorian gothic masterpiece. Some of these are fun, quirky spinoffs like Nightmare Kart, while others are more serious efforts to replicate Bloodborne's atmosphere. One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass. The original game was released back in 2023, but developer Kumi Souls Games just released a new DLC for it. Best of all, it's completely and utterly free. Titled The Last Faith: Awakened Ancients , the DLC so much add a single chunk of new game to play, instead sprinkling fresh, glistening giblets all around the existing experience. Chiefly, Awakened Ancients adds four new game modes for players to experiment with, including a dungeon mode that sounds reminiscent of Bloodborne's chalice dungeons, as w…",

The full version of No More Room in Hell 2 is definitely happening in 2026, however, and Torn Banner recently provided details on what the 1.0 update will bring. Primarily, that's two new modes, a multiplayer survival mode, and a single-player option for survivalist lone wolves. The former is undoubtedly the main event here. Survival is an alternative to No More Room in Hell 2's Objective mode that saw players converge on a central location from various corners of the map. \"Responders will have to secure objectives then hold out against an onslaught of Zombies with increasing difficulty,\" Torn Banner explains. \"Unlike our current game mode, survival will push our players into fights.\" This mode will apparently include several new maps to play on, which Torn Banner points out are \"more compact than existing objective …",

    "body": "I enjoy a good traced ray, AI-upscaled texture, or 'hallucinated' frame as much as the next person, but I think pixel art remains an important part of any art team's tool kit. Pixel art offers far more than a nostalgic throwback appeal, capable of a level of expression that would give even the most photorealistic polygons a run for their money. So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

Not that they're making the choice subversively; in fact, the software giant has been happy for its staff to try out various AI coding tools, including its own GitHub Copilot, Anthropic's Claude 4, and OpenAI's GPT-5. Apparently, Microsoft started the whole experiment last year , but just in the developer division, resulting in Claude Sonnet 4 being selected as the AI choice for paid users of GitHub Copilot, though the option to use others is still available. The Verge writes that now any staff member involved in 'Experiences + Devices' (i.e. Windows, Bing, 365, Surface, and so on) is being encouraged to experiment with Claude, even if they have no coding experience at all.

Lunar Lake is particularly at-risk from the ongoing memory crisis, which has seen memory in tight supply and prices skyrocket, due to its use of on-package memory. Take a look at the package and you can see two LPDDR5X chips nestled besides the processor. This has benefits for efficiency and size, but has caused some headaches for Intel. One issue from the get-go was price. Extra chips, more packaging steps, and securing memory all add to the cost of production for Lunar Lake versus other chips.
