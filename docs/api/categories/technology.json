You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year.\" Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI . This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming . Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. @c4news CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen…",

    "body": "A cursory search tells me that the last time Amazon's Luna cloud gaming service graced the pages of this website was in February this year, when our Harvey Randall offhandedly referenced it as \"a cloud gaming app that I literally hadn't heard of until this point\". Before that? 2022—a few months before I even began working here—when we informed you that Amazon Prime subscribers could now access Devil May Cry 5 in their browsers . It never set the world on fire, is my point, but fear not, because Amazon knows exactly how to revive it: an \"AI-powered\" social game starring Snoop Dogg. Obviously. What else could it possibly have been? To be fair, AI judge Snoop isn't the sum total of Amazon's plans for Luna. It's the flagship title for its pivot into a couch co-op-focused service. The \"all-new Amazon Luna\" will still have big-budget games on it, but the emphasis will very much be on more casual stuff you can play with friends and family. The next time you fire up Luna, ol' Bezos will present you with GameNight, the service's new hub, which will present you with a glittering array of casual games that everyone from you to your meemaw can fire up and join in with just by scanning a QR co…",

The good news is, you don't have to kiss it goodbye just yet. The bad news is, you probably should start thinking about an upgrade. I won't lecture you about upgrading your PC, as I assume you're in this situation because 1) you can't , or 2) you don't want to. I respect it. You're not alone: 32% of Steam gamers surveyed in September 2025 have yet to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11. If that's a similar figure outside of the gaming sphere—in any case, I'd guess a greater number of non-gaming machines are still running Windows 10—that could be a big problem for users and Microsoft. So, unless you're planning to use your Windows 10 PC with an air gap, otherwise known as unplugging it from the internet and any other networks, you'd better take note of Microsoft's end-of-life timeline here. I've gone through Microsoft's many, many support documents on this. Each page seemingly covers the same basic information but no page has all the information.

You have to respect it; that's years of holding out for improvements to the new OS before finally taking the plunge. The latest Steam Hardware Survey is out now , and in it we can see that the share of users on Windows 11 has increased by 2.65%. Windows 11 is run by 63.04% of those surveyed, up from 60.39% last month. Windows 10, on the other hand, has dropped by 2.9%. You'll notice that's not the same number of users that have jumped to Windows 11, which maybe would suggest some have switched to other OS platforms, primarily Linux, for their gaming machines. However, Linux only saw a small 0.04% increase in the past month, so that's not exactly popping off. It's more likely we're just seeing the imperfect methods of the Steam Hardware Survey. The survey is far from a perfect representation of the userbase of Valve's platform—it's more akin to \"guidelines\" than actual data, to loosely quote Captain Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean. Still, it's a good idea of what the general trends among users are. Of the many Linux distributions, it's Arch that has the lar…",

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock. But public companies have their disadvantages, too—particularly for consumers in creative and entertainment industries. Shareholder primacy, the theory that deliveri…",
