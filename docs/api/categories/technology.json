A power struggle between Activision and Infinity Ward's leaders, Jason West and Vince Zampella, had led to the expulsion of the latter two men from the company. \"I was speechless,\" West told Vanity Fair in 2011 . \"In my head, this was the moment when everyone was supposed to go home in a limousine. Instead, we were eating the seed corn and they were taking all the money.\" West and Zampella sued Activision for wrongful termination; Activision countersued, alleging the pair were \"small-minded executives\" motivated by \"envy and personal greed\". (Image credit: Activision) Ultimately, the publisher settled with West and Zampella ahead of a trial. But the damage was done. Many of Infinity Ward's veterans had followed their bosses to Respawn, a new EA-funded outfit that would go on to make Titanfall, Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Meanwhile, there was a yawning hole at the centre of the studio that was supposed to follow up two of the biggest blockbusters of all time. Infinity Ward was in no fit state to…",

You don't need me to tell you that's one hell of a sell, and it's exactly what The Henchmen promises—a retro-inspired, top-down sandbox shooter that's coming soon to Steam, whose chaotic cops-and-robbers set pieces nod to GTA 2, with claustrophobic quick-fire combat that echoes Dennaton's ultra-violent smash hit.

Lordbound transports Skyrim adventurers to the all-new valley of Druadach, a wartorn region that has recently reestablished its connection to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock. The mod sees you embroiled in a conflict between the Imperial Legion and a band of Orcs holed up in a mountain fortress, one that just so happens to be smack in the middle of a trade route between High Rock's capital Jehanna and Skyrim's largest city, Solitude.

It also adds the ability to cast signs, and even incorporates Geralt-style fisticuffs just in case you're caught without your weapon drawn. Chiefly, the mod replaces Milady and Leda's swords with blades of steel and silver, typically wielded by Witchers, both of which can be purchased from Merchant Kalé in Limgrave. The steel sword naturally scales with dexterity, while the silver sword dishes out big holy damage, making it ideal for dealing with undead creatures.

In unrelated news, the Associated Press has just reported that OpenAI's valuation has hit $500 billion , making a company that's never turned a profit into the most valuable startup in history. One market analyst reckons this tomfoolery has gone far enough, these companies and those who invest in them are about to hit \"diminishing returns hard\", and is telling their clients to steer well clear. Let's put the argument for AI as briefly as possible: It's going to change the world on a scale that is currently so unimaginable it could only be described as revolutionary. It will transform industries and economies. And it is only fair to say that AI technologies have achieved some remarkable things that may point in this direction, particularly in the field of medicine. But that's the thing.

Armstrong says it's all down to a proportion of the PC playerbase who still have hard disk drives (HDD) rather than solid-state drives (SSD). His full explanation follows but, essentially, Arrowhead duplicates a tonne of information in order to make the game load faster for those on HDDs (which matters because no match starts until all players have loaded the mission, regardless of hardware). \"An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data,\" says Armstrong ( thanks, VGC ). \"The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. \"To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.

Persona, one of the most popular videogame series of the last decade, is about a bunch of high school kids with supernatural abilities going to class while solving mysteries. I don't understand why Bandai Namco hasn't shamelessly ripped off the latter with a My Hero Academia game that'd make approximately one billion dollars, but its latest videogame adaptation is at least inching in that direction. At last week's Tokyo Game Show I played about half an hour of My Hero Academia: All's Justice, which is out on Steam next February. It's following a pair of games (One Justice and One Justice 2) that took one of the two default paths for an anime adaptation.

They'll start as simple dolls, but as child Sims play and grow fonder of their new toys, they unlock the ability to turn them into a magical bestie only they can see. It doesn't have to end there either—Imaginary Friends can become real Sims if their friendship grows strong enough. After hanging out with the Adventure Awaits dolls myself, I'm ready to offer a little friendship coaching and guidance on how to get an Imaginary Friend in The Sims 4 and make them real when the time comes. How to get an ImagineMe Doll in The Sims 4 Adventure Awaits (Image credit: EA) First things first, you'll need to buy an ImagineMe! Doll from Build Mode before conjuring up any make-believe buddies.
