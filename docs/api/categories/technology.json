The comments didn't attract much notice at the time, but similar remarks in a new Bloomberg interview about Larian's next big RPG, Divinity , have kicked up a storm of complaints which the studio is now pushing back on. In Bloomberg's words, Larian has been \"pushing hard\" on generative AI and its developers \"often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.\" Vincke reiterated in the interview that the studio isn't using generative AI to create any of the art, voices, or writing we see in its games. After the interview was published, he also said that \"pushing hard\" isn't a correct characterization of Larian's AI policy and that AI is not being used \"to develop concept art\" in his view—though it is being used in \"the very early ideation stages.\" Above: Our post-Game Awards interview with Larian about its next RPG .

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

    "body": "AI-generated voice 'acting'—despite the fact I've never heard an example that hasn't immediately made me less interested in a videogame—has still become more ubiquitous in gaming. Arc Raiders, by all accounts a dang successful videogame, uses it for text-to-speech lines. Speaking to PCGamesN , the voice actor for Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion, Neil Newbon (who knows a little bit about voice acting because he's won friggin awards for it ), was very down on AI voiceover, echoing statements both he and his fellow BG3 cast members have made before on the subject: \"Comparatively speaking, the amount of money it costs to do those voice lines compared to the rest of the game's development is peanuts. When a game's successful, I don't really get why [developers] don't go 'well, at the time we couldn't afford to do it—it was too much or too difficult—but now we've been super successful, why don't we go back and actually redo the lines with actors?' That's an option; I'm just saying.\" It's hard not to empathise with Newbon, here. The rational, sensible grown adult in me whole-heartedly agrees with him—compared to other development costs, hiring someone to go into a booth for a couple hours is …",

    "body": "Completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders sees you returning to a location from a previous quest, namely where you had to find a toxic barrel dumped in a drain for the Source of Contamination quest. This time, you're revisiting the same location and the same barrel, but there are a few additional steps that might trip you up. Considering the last thing you want to be doing is searching the swamp while there are other potentially loot-hungry Raiders on the prowl, here's what you need to do. I'd recommend foregoing a free loadout for this one, since a key you might need later drops at the end, and as we know with the Armored Transports quest, losing keys required for missions is a pain. Return to the water intake below the Water Treatment Control building You visited this barrel previously during the Source of Contamination quest (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step in this quest is pretty simple—you have to head back to the drain just outside and to the north of the Water Treatment Control building. Find the barrel, located on the map above by the drain to complete the first step. Simply go near the barrel to complete the first step (Image credit: Embark Studios) You also ca…",

In a recent blog post , Anthropic explains that as few as \"250 malicious documents can produce a 'backdoor' vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume.\" These findings arose from a joint study between Anthropic, the Alan Turing Institute, and the UK AI Security Institute. It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms. For instance, earlier this year YouTube creator f4mi became so fed up with her work being fed into AI models via her video subtitles, she 'poisoned' this data by inserting gibberish text only the AI could see . The more gibberish in the training data, the more gibbe…",

It's a short line from the end of the original campaign after defeating Lilith where she says, \"Without me, you would have no victory.\" Apparently, she meant that literally because Blizzard has confirmed that she's coming back for one final showdown. You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",
