We got the first screenshots and pitch for Penguin Colony back in June: A reimagining of H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, told from the perspective of a penguin. The original story centers on the discovery of an impossible lost city in the Antarctic and, it must be said, is told from the perspective of a Miskatonic University guy who goes crazy from all the alien stuff, not a penguin. Miskatonic U. faculty were some of Howard Philips Lovecraft's favorite guys to drive cuckoo, you see. The game's narrator, Howard Blakely, is a new character played by Brown, speaking to the penguin protagonist over vast distances⁠—though he's still a Miskatonic man. \"Our narrator is part of an expedition which has gone horribly wrong,\" Penguin Colony's Steam page explains. \"Having been called by the old ones, his brain no longer experiences time linearly.

If you were a goth kid in the '90s, you are going to feel completely at home. Between two preview builds, I've now played about three hours of Bloodlines 2, and in terms of its authenticity, I'm sold. From the moonlit streets, to the moody fashion, to the derelict mansions and art deco apartments, it couldn't feel more like a world where sexy-cool vampires would be at home. And there's no shyness about taking the tabletop lore seriously—concepts like the Camarilla and the Masquerade aren't just background, they're core to the story. (Image credit: Paradox Interactive) It can feel a bit like Proper Noun Overload, and there is something inherently stuffy about a lot of the bloodsucker politics. But that's punctured nicely by the two playable characters—Phyre, an ancient vampire awoken from over hundred years of slumber, and Fabien, a disembodied 1940s vampire detective who lives in their head (for slightly tangled reaso…",

And often the mantra of 'newer is better' genuinely does become a thing with advances being made across almost every category of PC hardware. But sometimes, just sometimes, a piece of tech ends up dominating for a long time without anyone coming close to beating what makes it so good. That's been the case for the longest time for the best gaming mouse , and more specifically, the best MMO gaming mouse. Razer's Naga, in many different guises, has historically held the top spot for that particular category. But no longer, as Corsair has broken into our guide with the superlative Scimitar Elite Wireless SE , which is now absolutely the best MMO gaming mouse . Previously, the Razer Naga Pro held the position thanks to its swappable button facias and excellent battery life. But the Corsair mouse has knocked it off the list because it's just such a versatile gaming mouse. Not only does it have a ton of programmable buttons, but they can also be adjusted and positioned so they fit …",

One of the reasons given for the termination was the state of the game. The founders believed that it was ready for an early access launch and planned to go through with it; Krafton, meanwhile, believed it wasn't ready for its debut and that the founders had been shirking their duties . But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument. The lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, so Fortis Advisors, which represents the ousted founders, sought discovery to see if Krafton held evidence to back up its claims. \"But despite its obvious relevance, Krafton feigned astonishment during the parties' meet and confers at how it could possibly be part of Phase I,\" Fortis said.

According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker.
