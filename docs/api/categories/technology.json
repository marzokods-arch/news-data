    "body": "Every Monday, more than a hundred members of Giovanni Traverso’s Laboratory for Translational Engineering (L4TE) fill a large classroom at Brigham and Women’s Hospital for their weekly lab meeting. With a social hour, food for everyone, and updates across disciplines from mechanical engineering to veterinary science, it’s a place where a stem cell biologist might weigh in on a mechanical design, or an electrical engineer might spot a flaw in a drug delivery mechanism. And it’s a place where everyone is united by the same goal: engineering new ways to deliver medicines and monitor the body to improve patient care. Traverso’s weekly meetings bring together a mix of expertise that lab members say is unusual even in the most collaborative research spaces. But his lab—which includes its own veterinarian and a dedicated in vivo team—isn’t built like most. As an associate professor at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s, and an associate member of the Broad Institute, Traverso leads a sprawling research group that spans institutions, disciplines, and floors of lab space at MIT and beyond.&nbsp; For a lab of this size—spread across MIT, the Broad, the Brigham, the Koch Instit…",

    "body": "When Madonna Yoder ’17 was eight years old, she learned how to fold a square piece of paper over and over and over again. After about 16 folds, she held a bird in her hands. The first time she pulled the tail of a flapping crane, she says, she realized: Oh, I folded this, and now it’s a toy .&nbsp; That first piece was an origami classic, folded by kids at summer camp for generations and many people’s first foray into the art form. Often, it’s also the last. But Yoder was transfixed. Soon she was folding everything she could find: paper squares from chain craft shops, scraps from around the house, the weekly church bulletin, which she would cut into pieces with the aid of her fingernails. She would then “turn those into little critters and give them to any guests that were there that week,” she says.&nbsp; Today, perhaps millions of folds later, Yoder is a superstar known to some as the “Queen of Tessellations,” a reference to a mathematically intricate type of origami that she began exploring during her years at MIT.&nbsp; “These are patterns that can repeat infinitely and are folded on a single sheet of paper,” Yoder explains. “There’s literally no end to the patterns themselves…",

    "body": "Institute Professor Mildred “Millie” Dresselhaus forever altered our understanding of matter—the physical stuff of the universe that has mass and takes up space. Over 57 years at MIT, Dresselhaus also played a significant role in inspiring people to use this new knowledge to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges, from producing clean energy to curing cancer. Although she became an emerita professor in 2007, Dresselhaus, who taught electrical engineering and physics, remained actively involved in research and all other aspects of MIT life until her death in 2017. She would have been 95 this November. Known as the “Queen of Carbon,” Dresselhaus was most often heralded for her pioneering work with one of nature’s most abundant and versatile substances. As a result of her insatiable curiosity about our world and her nearly six-decade career as a scientific explorer, we can thank her for significant leaps in how we think about carbon’s various forms and the company it keeps. In her early career, Dresselhaus employed a then-new invention—laser light—to probe carbon’s inner workings. She worked to distinguish how, for example, flat sheets of carbon atoms act differently from car…",

    "body": "A lot of attention has been paid to how climate change can reduce biodiversity. Now MIT researchers have shown that the reverse is also true: Loss of biodiversity can jeopardize regrowth of tropical forests, one of Earth’s most powerful tools for mitigating climate change. Combining data from thousands of previous studies and using new tools for quantifying interconnected ecological processes, the researchers analyzed numerous tropical sites where deforestation was being followed by natural regrowth, focusing on the role of animals such as birds and monkeys that spread plant seeds by eating them in one place and then defecating someplace else. Evan Fricke, a research scientist in the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the lead author of a paper on the work, has studied such animals for 15 years, showing that without their role, trees have lower survival rates and a harder time keeping up with environmental changes.&nbsp; Since tropical forests are Earth’s largest land-based carbon sink, such challenges make it harder to fight climate change. But the influence of biodiversity on forests’ ability to absorb carbon has not been fully quantified. To do that, the …",

It can help people with above-the-knee amputations walk faster, climb stairs, and avoid obstacles more easily than they could with a traditional prosthesis, which is attached to the residual limb by means of a socket and can be uncomfortable. For several years, Hugh Herr, SM ’93, co-director of the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics, has been working with his colleagues on techniques that can extract neural information from muscles left behind after an amputation and use that information to help guide a prosthetic limb. The approach, known as agonist-antagonist myoneuronal interface (AMI), has been shown to help people with below-the-knee amputations walk faster and navigate around obstacles much more naturally.&nbsp; The new system is anchored to the bone and controlled by the nervous system, offering more stability and easier navigation.

The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia by William Whyte, an urbanist and social thinker best known as the author of The Organization Man . They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations. “Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says coauthor Carlo Ratti, director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab. “Public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.” The scholars speculate that some of the reasons may have to do with cell phones and Starbucks: People text each other to meet up instead of hanging around to encounter each other in public, and when they do get together, they often choose an indoor space like a coffee shop. The results could help designers seeking to create new public areas or modify existing ones. “Public space is such an impo…",

The team used two approaches. First, they directed generative AI to design molecules based on a chemical fragment their model had predicted would show antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms generate molecules without constraints. They designed more than 36 million possible compounds this way and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties.&nbsp; The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes. This makes them less vulnerable to antibiotic resistance, a growing problem: It is estimated that drug-­resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year worldwide. Now that they can generate and evaluate compounds that have never been seen before, the researchers hope they can use the same strategy to identify and design drugs that attack other species of bacteria. “We’re excited about the new possibilitie…",

An aero-astro major, Estrada says that pitching at MIT has never involved transferring aerodynamic knowledge from the classroom to the mound. Still, he says, he’s benefited as an athlete from “learning to think like an engineer generally, learning to think through problems the right way and finding the best solution.” In the 2025 season Estrada went 6–0 with a 2.21 ERA, striking out 66.
