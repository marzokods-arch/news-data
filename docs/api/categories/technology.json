AMD's Ryzen CPU announcements this year fall firmly into the latter camp—these are all gently tweaked variants of chips that launched in 2024 and 2025. \"New,\" for certain values of \"new\" These Ryzen AI 400-series chips are slightly faster than, but otherwise functionally identical to, the Ryzen AI 300 series.
