    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

With Scroll and translate, you can continue to use your phone while it translates what’s on the screen. The feature has been limited to Samsung devices since it first launched in September, but is now rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer Pixel devices. Google started pushing the second quarterly Android 16 — QPR2 — update to the Pixel 6 and newer Pixels earlier this week. As with the first quarterly update, there is a significant emphasis on visual improvements . The Android QPR2 brings support for force-theming icons, a forced dark mode for apps that don’t inherently support it, additional accessibility features for better screen visibility, and more. One more feature that may have flown under the radar is the improvements the update brings to Circle to Search, and particularly how it handles translations. Until now, if you had to use Circle to Search for translations, it required capturing a screen and then waiting for translations. However, the new update includes a “ Scroll and translate ” option, allowing Circle to Search to translate text while you scroll…",

In November, T-Mobile shared plans to “unleash the un-carrier” at a live event held in Las Vegas. During that event, the company unveiled its new “ Switching Made Easy ” tool, an AI-powered guide within the T-Life app that scans your existing AT&amp;T or Verizon account to provide suggestions for similar T-Mobile plans.

These clouds, called H II (‘H-two’) regions, are a sign that the galaxy is home to especially young, hot, and massive stars that blaze with high-energy radiation. Such massive stars shake up their surroundings by heating their birth clouds with powerful stellar winds, eventually exploding as supernovae.

After an impressive in-store demo, I paid the price of a used car for my Vision Pro. The honeymoon phase wore off in the weeks and months that followed, and now, the recent Samsung Galaxy XR launch has me thinking I invested in the wrong XR platform. The dream of having a do-it-all device that can handle your productivity, entertainment, and gaming needs is still very much alive. I question whether the hardware is mature enough to deliver on that dream, but one thing’s for sure: Samsung’s Galaxy XR comes closer to realizing it than Vision Pro. I’ve lived with the mistakes Apple made in creating the Vision Pro as an early adopter, forcing me to take extreme measures like 3D-printing custom comfort accessories, buying extra straps, and paying for overpriced digital content.",

The app creates a Wi-Fi file server, allowing you to transfer APK files from a phone or PC browser and install them directly on the watch. This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user. Thankfully, there’s a new app on the block that makes it easy to install APK files on your smartwatch, while also offering file manager functionality.
