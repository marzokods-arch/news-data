    "body": "Every Fallout game is meaningfully different from the last, and the series includes some of the best games you'll ever play . It's an easy recommendation to anyone with a passing interest in computer roleplay, and even easier now that you can get every game in the series (including the black sheep, Tactics) along with a boatload of DLC for $77 . That's almost as cheap as a crate full of puppets! That's thanks to a live Steam sale, which you can peruse at your leisure here if you're itching to figure out what all those Magic the Gathering cards are about. If you're not sure which to buy and would rather start with just one, here's the main series rundown. The original two Fallout games are top-down, turn-based masterworks that, while pretty old, are landmark CRPGs and furnished the series with its iconic juxtaposition of atomic age aesthetics, grisly hyperviolence, and sardonic humor. The first Fallout game is my personal favorite, and don't let its vintage fool you—as 90s RPGs go, it's approachable. Fallout 3 and the Obsidian-developed New Vegas come after the series was bought from the original publisher, Interplay, by Bethesda. These 3D open-world RPGs are both widely celebrated…",

Given the whole process is necessarily artificial, it never struck me how bizarre it looks in the instant before the fade—when the NPC about to vanish lights up like they've just been plugged into the mains. As well as all shadows on them disappearing their hair looks super weird, vanishing from their eyebrows, sideburns, and the nape of the neck as the transparencies suddenly fail.

It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why.

    "body": "There's no greater pain in a MOBA than seeing your favorite hero swept into the swirling void of unplayability by a hero ban, but it’s a necessary evil, at least for buttoned-up ranked play. Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.
