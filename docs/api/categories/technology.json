While it looks like a simple remaster of Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, the package also includes an alternate storyline the same size as the first one. While the series stalled after the third game, is 2x2 actually going to equal Dangonronpa 4?

New victims, new culprits, and brand-new tricks await.

Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game.

A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore.

Such is the case with Battlefield 6: Technical director Christian Buhl told IGN that Ripple Effect ( formerly DICE LA ) \"did not want leaks,\" but it did want as much feedback from players as possible—and that meant rolling the dice. \"We had, actually, discussions, I think about a year or two ago,\" Buhl said. \"I guess it was maybe about two years ago, about how much we were going to do to prevent leaks versus how much we were going to do to get the game in front of players.

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay.

After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

    "body": "To me, an outsider who hasn't had the chance to jump into Silksong yet, it seems like there's no end to the possibilities of what players can find in Team Cherry's latest game. I've heard of thieving bugs, a blood-boiling High Halls gauntlet , and something called the Twisted Bud—I don't want to know. So it doesn't come as a surprise to me that somewhere in the caverns of this cursed and beloved game, there would be a string of secret easter eggs, such as the latest discovery, which is a small reference to Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 . First pointed out on a Reddit thread and then confirmed by RPS , if you head west of Wormways and then play your needolin at the Weavenest Karn, text will appear above your head that reads \"for those who come after\". there is an expedition 33 reference in silksong??? pic.twitter.com/31Jgmt4tgG September 11, 2025 This links to Expedition 33, as this phrase is not just the foundation of each Expedition's pledge to carry forth in the face of hardship to lay the groundwork for the next team, but it is also found in a journal entry toward the beginning of the game that reads \"Learn from the ones who came before, and lay the trail f…",

    "body": "Gigabyte has just released three new motherboards with on-board AI to tune your Ryzen processor for top performance in games, even promising up to a 25% improvement. Thanks, bot. Back at Computex, Taiwan's biggest tech show, we heard about the latest version of Gigabyte's X3D Turbo Mode , a technology that would squeeze the ever-loving heck out of your Ryzen processor to extract every drop of performance out of it. This technology, aptly-named X3D Turbo Mode 2.0, works by analysing what a chip is doing and adjusting frequency, power, core count, and balancing temperature to improve performance dynamically. Gigabyte announced the tech but the motherboards fitted with it had been a no-show. Until now. The X870E Aorus Elite X3D Ice , X870E Aorus Master X3D Ice , and X870E Aorus Pro X3D Ice are now officially available (though yet to show up at any retailer). \"Our proprietary X3D Turbo Mode 2.0 intelligently dynamically optimizes gaming performance up to 25% by built-in AI model, delivering exceptional gaming experience and productivity that adapts to your usage scenario in real-time,\" Gigabyte says. \"Up to 25%\" improvement—that's a greater improvement than the company previously note…",

Speaking to Automaton , senior PR rep Piotr Gnyp emphasized that by saying, \"GOG has been doing this for well over a decade, and we're constantly reaching out to secure iconic games. Sometimes, it takes years. Diablo came to GOG after almost a decade of conversations. Preservation often means knocking on the same doors again and again, hearing 'no' most of the time, until one day, it's finally a 'yes.'\" That paid off with GOG eventually getting to re-release a handful of Japanese games that were difficult to get hold of in the west like Silent Hill 4: The Room, some of the early Metal Gears, and the OG Castlevanias and Contras. Capcom eventually agreed to let GOG re-release Dino Crisis and the first three Resident Evils, though it took \"time, persistence, and trust-building,\" Gnyp says. A re-release of Breath of Fire 4 earlier this year was one of the stand-outs of GOG's preservation initiative launched in late 2024 . \"Working with Japanese partners often requires demonstrating both technical capability and …",
