The open source Doom port —which can trace its lineage back to the original launch of ZDoom back in 1998 —adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to the original Doom source code that John Carmack released in 1997. Now, though, the community behind GZDoom is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork called UZDoom . The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of GZDoom creator and maintainer Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl) , who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the GZDoom codebase. \"Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we've decided that the best course of action was to fork the project,\" developer Nash Muhandes wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday . \"I don't want to see the GZDoom legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is t…",

The subpoenas are supposed to support OpenAI's defense in a lawsuit Musk's X Corp filed to block the for-profit transition. Seeking a \"wide variety of documents\"—including a sweeping request for all communications regarding Musk and all information on nonprofits' funders and donations—OpenAI claimed that the subpoenas are intended to probe if Musk was involved in the actions or paid nonprofits to make critical comments, NBC News wrote in a report exhaustively documenting the controversy. But nonprofits have alleged it's obvious that OpenAI is using the lawsuit to harass, silence, and intimidate its critics—most glaringly when it comes to targeting nonprofits that are even more publicly critical of Musk's companies than they are of OpenAI.

    "body": "As recently as the 1990s, when the Greenland Ice Sheet and the rest of the Arctic region were measurably thawing under the climatic blowtorch of human-caused global warming, most of Antarctica’s vast ice cap still seemed securely frozen. But not anymore. Physics is physics. As the planet heats up, more ice will melt at both poles, and recent research shows that Antarctica’s ice caps, glaciers, and floating ice shelves, as well as its sea ice, are just as vulnerable to warming as the Arctic. Both satellite data and field observations in Antarctica reveal alarming signs of a Greenland-like meltdown, with increased surface melting of the ice fields, faster-moving glaciers, and dwindling sea ice. Some scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that the rapid “Greenlandification” of Antarctica will have serious consequences, including an accelerated rise in sea levels and significant shifts in rainfall and drought patterns.

That is helpful for paperwork tasks like \"just being able to write our weekly reports and things,\" Taylor said, but it also aids in informing their overall direction. Read full article Comments",

Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.” Read full article Comments",

F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years . Unprecedented During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched.

In separate press briefings on Tuesday, a network of terminated CDC staff that goes by the name the National Public Health Coalition, and the union representing employees at the agency discussed what the wide-scale cuts mean for the American people, as well as the trauma, despair, and damage they have wreaked on the workers of the once-premier public health agency. In a normal federal layoff—called a reduction in force, or RIF—the agency would be given a full outline of the roles and branches or divisions affected, as well as some explanation for the cuts, such as alleged fraud, abuse, or redundancy. However, the Trump administration has provided no such information or explanation, leaving current and former employees to essentially crowdsource what has been lost and only guess at the possible reasons.

We are not banning bulk billing. We're not even limiting how much money the people can make.

And if you're worried about the cost of conjuring all these AI videos, Google is also adding a \"Fast\" variant of Veo. Veo made waves when it debuted earlier this year , demonstrating a staggering improvement in AI video quality just a few months after Veo 2's release. It turns out that having all that video on YouTube is very useful for training AI models, so Google is already moving on to Veo 3.1 with a raft of new features. Google says Veo 3.1 offers stronger prompt adherence, which results in better video outputs and fewer wasted compute cycles. Audio, which was a hallmark feature of the Veo 3 release, has reportedly improved, too. Veo 3's text-to-video was limited to 720p landscape output, but there's an ever-increasing volume of vertical video on the Internet. So Veo 3.1 can produce bot…",

    "body": "On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company will allow verified adult users to have erotic conversations with ChatGPT starting in December. The change represents a shift in how OpenAI approaches content restrictions, which the company had loosened in February but then dramatically tightened after an August lawsuit from parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly receiving encouragement from ChatGPT. \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" Altman wrote in his post on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement follows OpenAI's recent hint that it would allow developers to create \"mature\" ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls. Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\" but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot \"less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.\" The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allo…",

Today, Apple formally announced the new tablets, and it looks like pretty much everything uncovered by that YouTuber turned out to be accurate. The new iPad Pros, powered by Apple's also-new M5 chip, use the same basic designs as the M4 iPad Pros from last year and are compatible with the same cases and accessories. The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model, is available for pre-order today , and ships on October 22. Apple's M5 is similar in composition to the M4—the fully enabled version uses four high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency CPU cores, 10 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. But a memory bandwidth increase, from 120GB/s for the M4 to 153GB/s for the M5, enables a 30 percent improvement in GPU performance and a 45 percent increase to ray-traced graphics performance, according to Apple's estimates. Apple's press release also highlighted improvements to storage performance, with \"up to 2x faster storage read and write speeds.\" Read full article Comments",

Those models will continue to use the M4 Pro and M4 Max for now, and we probably shouldn't expect an update for them until sometime next year. Aside from the M5, the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro has essentially identical specs to the outgoing M4 version.

The Vision Pro could still eventually lead to a product that ushers in a new age of \"spatial computing.\" But it does seem like Apple is a bit less optimistic about the headset's current form—at least, that's one possible way to read the fact that the second-generation Vision Pro is being announced via press release, rather than as the centerpiece of a product event. The new Vision Pro is available for the same $3,499 as the first model, which will likely continue to limit the headset's appeal outside of a die-hard community of early adopters and curious developers.

    "body": "Here at Ars, we have been writing about rumors of a portable Xbox for literal decades now . With the ROG Xbox Ally, Microsoft has finally made those rumors a reality in the weirdest, most Microsoft way possible. Yes, the $600 ROG Xbox Ally—and its souped-up cousin, the $1,000, ridiculous-mouthful-of-a-name ROG Xbox Ally X, which we tested—are the first official handheld hardware to sport the Xbox brand name. But Microsoft isn’t taking the exclusive-heavy , walled garden software approach that it has been committed to for nearly 25 years of Xbox home consoles. Instead, the ROG Xbox Ally is, at its base, simply a new version of Asus’ Windows-based ROG Ally line with an Xbox-flavored coat of paint. That coat of paint—what Microsoft is calling the Xbox Full-screen Experience (FSE)—represents the company’s belated attempt to streamline the Windows gaming experience to be a bit more console-like in terms of user interface and overall simplicity. While that’s a worthy vision, the execution in these early days is so spotty and riddled with annoyances that it’s hard to recommend over the SteamOS-based competition. Read full article Comments",
