    "body": "A$AP Rocky has been one of the more celebrated names in pop culture over the past 15 years, ever since his debut mixtape, Live.Love.ASAP , launched him onto the scene in 2011. But lately, he’s been known more for his fashion and film forays than for his music. It&#8217;s been eight years since the release of Rocky’s last album, 2018’s Testing , which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, marking his third straight release in the top five of the tally.

Apps are going missing from Google’s Nest Hub smart displays . A Reddit post showing a relatively empty app drawer on a Nest Hub led us to check our own devices — and sure enough, my Nest Hub Max is also missing shortcuts to apps it once had, though I’m not sure when they disappeared. User Head_Worldliness5101 posted on the Google Home subreddit yesterday, saying that the apps previously accessible from the app drawer on their second-generation Nest Hub smart display are now mostly gone, leaving only Sling, Stories, and YouTube TV.

A quick heads-up, though: Many of these features are currently in early access.

Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings.

If you saw an SOS icon instead of your usual 5G bars last Wednesday, you probably felt cut off from the digital world. Verizon has since fixed the problem and restored service , but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now starting its own probe. Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours. Many customers saw only the SOS icon instead of signal bars, which meant they could still call emergency services, but regular calls and data did not work.",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",
