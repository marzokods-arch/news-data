The senator is concerned that the integration could lead to the exploitation of user data or to manipulating users into paying higher prices. Warren is also concerned that Google could prioritize shopping results from retail partners over competitors. In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI. This move has now attracted the attention of one US senator, and for good reason. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A separate leak points to an 8.8-inch 3K 165Hz display, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, and a sole 50MP camera. The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets. With the proliferation of specialist handhelds and more powerful gaming phones, compact Android gaming tablets don’t come around very often these days. However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes. In the accompanying text, Lenovo refers to the device as the “Lenovo AI Tablet Legion Y700,” with the AI part feeling almost obligatory in 2026.

And as unusual (or unnecessary) as it may sound, Gemini will also bear the load when you don’t want to appear in front of the camera during video calls.

Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US.

Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks.

    "body": "TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy S21 series no longer appears on the regular security update lists, signaling the end of routine updates. The Galaxy S22 series has moved from monthly to quarterly security updates as the end of its support life draws closer. Samsung’s typical seven-year update promise only arrived with the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S phones now come with seven years of software support as standard, but that promise only kicked in with the Galaxy S24 series. Older flagships are still bound by the update policies in place when they launched, and for the Galaxy S21 lineup, it looks like the end has arrived. According to the latest security update listings published on SamsungMobile.com (via SamMobile ), the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra no longer appear on any of the company’s monthly or quarterly update schedules. That’s a clear indication that these phones are no longer set to receive regular OS updates or security patches. As usual, an update could still arrive if a critical vulnerability demands it, but routine updates appear to be over.",
