I'd much rather just go with the flow and see where the round ends me up. But the problem with that is that chances are, when you need a key card, you won't have one. Unless you have some creative friends by your side. Last night PC Gamer's strategic director Evan Lahti was playing Arc Raiders with his squad when he came across a very convenient hack. If one of your squad members places themself right in the corner of the door and another raider jumps on their head, then it'll clip them through the locked door. Once the person who clipped inside can then open the door to let the rest of their squad inside. And then voila, you can all get some high-level loot without the hassle of bringing in a key card. The locked room in question they managed to break into, was the Dam Control Tower. This is one of the high-level loot spots on the Dam Battleground map, located in the centre of the ma…",

According to the WSJ, the chips were bought from Nvidia by Silicon Valley-based AI server manufacturer Aivres , which operates under a parent company that is one-third-owned by Inspur, a Chinese company that was added to the US government's trade blacklist in 2023, over claims that it worked on Chinese military supercomputing projects.

Far down the ladder from these decisions is Eleventh Hour Games, the developer behind Last Epoch, which Krafton acquired in July . The timing couldn't have been worse as it happened right after the founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds were unceremoniously fired for what they claim was a move to avoid paying a $250 million earnout. At the time, EHG founder Judd Cobler told fans of the budding action RPG that having a corporate owner would only benefit the game in the long run by giving them access to more resources and employees. Fans of the game were understandably skeptical about how the buyout would impact the game. That skepticism turned into outright worry when Last Epoch's first expansion, Orobyss, was announced during a Sony State of Play in September.

Over the last few months, however, Moonshot Games has been preparing a major update that could give it a second chance. On November 19, the Emergence update will finally give new players a mode that helps onboard them to the intricacies of joining a crew and flying a space ship. It will also include a mode that cuts out all the looting and focuses on large-scale ship battles. And a new alien prospector will join the roster with the ability to revive teammates. In my Wildgate review , I wrote about what I think is its biggest weakness: It's an incredibly clever concept to drop a bunch of space ships into a pocket of space …",

Sadly, we're going to have to wait a bit longer for anything specific, but the official trailer for Season 2 just dropped, and I think it'll tide me over until the episodes finally come out. There is a hell of a lot to unpack in the short two-minute 38-second trailer, but I'm going to try my best to do so. (Image credit: Prime Video) At the end of Fallout Season 1 , our main cast of characters had split up, and it seems like the second season will follow a similar structure to the first in that episodes will cut between the various groups, following their stories side by side. It looks like Maximus and Thaddeus are still together, although Thaddeus has seen better days, as his recent ghoulification has had a couple of visual repercussions. The mouth on his collarbone does not look good. And Maximus still seems obsessed with \"that girl\", our protagonist Lucy MacLean. Cut to Lucy, and she's still got The Ghoul and Dogmeat by her side as she…",

In May of this year, AMD announced a massive new update to its upscaling tech, giving us our first glimpse of FSR 4 \"Redstone\" which was said to be bringing a whole host of machine learning-based improvements. One of the key features is the addition of Ray Regeneration, which, much like Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction tech , is said to be capable of regenerating inaccurate pixels to prevent the gritty, noisy mess that can surround some ray traced lighting effects. The Redstone update was supposed to be making an appearance at some point this year, but it's been so long since we'd heard anything about it, I'd nearly forgotten it existed. Available on AMD Radeon™ RX 9000 Series graphics cards, FSR ‘Redstone’ Ray Regeneration goes live tomorrow in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

But amid all that, we've got a set of patch notes which also look pretty stacked. The 1.20 update doesn't just add Stella Montis into the mix, but it also adds two new arcs, the Matriarch and Shredder, alongside making crafting cheaper, buffing some little arcs, and fixing one of the most annoying issues with PvP fights. (Image credit: Embark) Except for the Wolfpack grenade, which now needs an extra refined explosive, other items like Arc motion cores, circuitry, and launcher ammo are now all cheaper to make, with Spotter Relays and Wolfpacks also being worth more coins now. If you're a fan of the Hullcracker like I am, then this will be music to your ears, as cheaper launcher ammo means more arc explosions. The update also fixed an issue with the Fireball arcs, where they could get stuck on security gates, stopping them from chasing after raiders. Now they'll be able to zoom past the doors right up to your feet and light you up in flames. But the gold medal in this patch notes has to go to the following fix: \"Re…",

It was a pretty long process, considering I started it immediately at level 20 and now I'm level 33. It saw me desperately rummaging through apartments in Dam Battlegrounds praying for a Humidifier drop, farming Leapers with Wolfpack grenades, and searching high and low for Cooling Fans. The surprise fifth and final stage practically emptied my 256 item vault to fulfil its conditions, dumping crafting mats, weapons, gadgets, and trinkets en masse into my Expedition pod to reach its value capacities. Disregarding the four previous stages, you need a grand total of $830,000 worth of various loot items, and that's a whole heap of stuff .

The game couldn't escape direct, somewhat unfavorable comparisons to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild—but until Dec. 2, it has one thing over most any Nintendo game. It's free! On the Ubisoft store , anyway. The core game is free to keep, and the Gold Edition—which includes the season pass and some cosmetic goodies—is on sale for $15. The game is also included in Ubisoft's Game Pass-esque subscription on the platform, but it's an odd value proposition when the studio's games so frequently end up on such steep discounts. The promotion is angled to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Ubisoft Connect, as shared in a blog post Monday. I mostly know the app as the cobweb-covered desktop icon I occasionally use to launch Steep or a Rayman game, or as the benign growth I find tacked onto any Ubisoft-published games I try to launch from Steam (a platform Ubisoft has unsuccessfully tried to jump ship from before), but I suppose I can't complain about the cross-play and cross-save.
