If you're out of the loop, Stella Montis is a brand-new map that releases whenever we've pooled enough materials together to complete this stage. While contributing to the community's efforts in unlocking the map is the main goal, of course, it's not selfish to consider the fact that you also earn Merits for donating materials. Merits are an event currency that you'll be able to spend on a new reward track in the next phase of the community event, once the Stella Montis map is actually available. Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu. The crucial part is that the maximum amount of Merits you can earn (during this phase, at least) is 900, so you'll have completed your personal contribution after donating 225 materials. In other words, just 45 clicks, or 46 if you're counting the button to open the event page.

    "body": "Computer chips are undoubtedly one the great wonders of the modern world, incredible feats of engineering. And just when you thought they couldn't get any more complex and intriguing, here comes Inverse Lithography Technology, or ILT, a weird and alien technology that promises to push chip design to yet higher levels of performance. ILT is not, strictly, new. But according to YouTube channel Asianometry , it is being used in revolutionary new ways by chip manufacturer TSMC and Nvidia, everyone's favourite $5 trillion graphics chip company. This is a complex story, but to précis the salient details, the use of extreme ultraviolet light to shrink down chip components to smaller proportions than ever before throws up some rather peculiar problems, leading to flaws when transferring the patterns contained in the lithography masks to the silicon wafers. In simple terms, it comes down to the way the EUV light diffracts and distorts as it passes through the various lenses, reflectors and apertures of the mind-boggling complex ASML lithography machines used by TSMC to manufacture the most advanced chips. Using conventional chip production techniques, these can't all be controlled and corr…",

    "body": "Completing A Warm Place to Rest in Arc Raiders is relatively simple besides one slightly tricky step where you have to follow a trail of red markers snaking across the Buried City map. Similar to A Reveal in Ruins or The Root of the Matter , this simple quest among the sand-sunken tenements of the city only has a couple of steps. The first step also gives you the location you need to start it, so it really is just following the red markers that might trip you up. Seeing as you have no items to extract, consider bringing a free loadout , but otherwise, here's how to complete A Warm Place to Rest, including where to find the grave at the end of the red marker trail. Locate the Abandoned Highway Camp The Abandoned Highway Camp is in southwest Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step is heading to the Abandoned Highway Camp in the southwest of the Buried City. If you haven't been here before, you'll have to climb up onto the rooftops to access this camp on a raised highway. Look for the yellow-marked backpack to investigate (Image credit: Embark Studios) Once there, you'll be told to \"search for any signs of survivors\". For this step, you need to investigate the yell…",

    "body": "SoftBank is the world's biggest technology investment management group, and it's just pulled its entire $5.83 billion stake out of Nvidia, according to Bloomberg . It has reportedly sold all these shares to help bankroll its continued investments into AI. This was followed by its own share price sliding , but that's only by a few dollars so far , putting the company back to where it was just a few days ago, before a climb after reporting its stellar profits of over $16 billion [PDF warning] yesterday. In other words, SoftBank reported high profits and its share price climbed, then almost immediately dumped its Nvidia stocks, and its price dipped again. Nvidia's share price also dipped a little , too, after SoftBank shed stocks. SoftBank has already said it's attempting to position itself as \"the organiser of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era\", investing heavily into AI companies, for instance pledging a $40 billion investment into OpenAI earlier in the year. It looks like the company is continuing this push by selling off as much as it can to keep pumping money into AI superscalers and providers. One might initially consider that SoftBank is, in some way, bettin…",
