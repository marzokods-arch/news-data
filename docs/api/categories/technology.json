    "body": "The Arc Raiders server slam playtest kicked off today, offering one last free weekend testing session before the game launches on October 30. And it's putting up serious numbers, with more than 185,000 people playing right now—on Steam alone. That number, courtesy of SteamDB , is good enough to put Arc Raiders in the number four spot on Steam's most played list , ahead of PUBG, Rust, and Bongo Cat. It's even more impressive when you consider that the server slam is also available on the Epic Games Store as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, meaning the actual number of people playing is higher—likely much higher. Despite the enviable crush of players, the test seems to be going very well. Embark Studios pushed a hotfix shortly after the playtest started to address crashes and errors, which unfortunately required a \"full redownload\" of the game, but said that \"should not be the norm moving forward.\" Since that patch, though, there's been no indication of big issues: Two of our best men, Morgan Park and Lincoln Carpenter, are apparently spending their Friday, uhh, testing the game , and say they haven't run into any issues.

Sora has been used to produce videos featuring Dr. King's likeness delivering the \"I have a dream\" speech while making monkey noises ; another video shows him fighting his contemporary and fellow activist Malcolm X. OpenAI has admitted this sort of stuff amounts to \"disrespectful depictions\", which is putting it mildly, and says it's stopped users being able to generate videos featuring Dr. King's likeness \"as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures.\" Dr. King is far from the only historical figure to have been reanimated in oft-tasteless fashion.

The answer came in July 2025 when Sony filed suit , shortly after which Tencent did something unusual: It purged most of the Horizon-like content from the game's Steam page, and delayed its launch target from late 2025 to late 2027—all without saying a word about why, or even acknowledging it was being done at all. The \"why\" seemed obvious enough: Light of Motiram really did look an awful lot like Horizon: Zero Dawn, in some very overt ways. Despite Tencent's lack of comment, I assumed the store page changes, and the huge two-year delay, represented a fairly complete walkback and rework. But it seems that Sony isn't buying it: As reported by Games Fray , Sony has now filed for a preliminary injunction against Tencent's use of any material \"copied or derived\" from the Horizon games. That covers a lot of ground, but the filing focuses heavily on Tencent's use of a character in Light of Motiram promotional images who looks a lot like Alo…",

Game servers for big, anticipated new releases have a nasty tendency of crumbling under the load of a big launch day, as Dune: Awakening reminded us earlier this year. That's where a server slam—a stress test with a catchier name—comes in: The goal is to hammer the infrastructure as hard as possible to see how it holds up. It's not a guarantee of a smooth-sailing launch day (Dune: Awakening also reminded us of that ), but it's at least an attempt, and also a way of rooting out any overlooked issues that might trigger surprise headaches. For you , though, what it is, is three days of playtime with one of the games we're looking forward to the most in 2025: PC Gamer shooterguy Morgan Park said back in April that Arc Raiders \"is a much more exciting extraction shooter than Marathon ,\" which may or may not have played a role in Marathon's delay to some indefinite future date just a few months…",

The term 'AI PC' has always been a struggle to define, ranging from Microsoft's earlier assertion that an AI PC must have an NPU with at least 45 TOPS of processing power to meet the qualification (that rules out most AMD-chipped desktop machines, then) to whether it's got a physical Copilot button on the keyboard. The good news is, MS seems to think we'll all have an AI PC soon, thanks to Copilot. Well, as long as you're running the latest version of Windows 11, that is. If I were a cynical man, I'd say it was almost like the term had no viable definition in the first place and merely served as a marketing tool to boost new PC sales.

Dames 4 Games (D4G), a non-profit organisation that promotes the work of women and femme-led studios in the gaming industry. We're talking digital showcases, charity streams and fundraisers, and mentorship programs—in other words, all good work. Ghouls 4 Games will take that good work in a pair of stick-on vampire teeth for the spookiest season with three major events between October 24 and November 7. First up is the Halloween Bash Showcase, which'll be airing October 24 at 12 pm PT / 8 pm GMT. This scare-infused showcase will feature only the best games from the crypts of its featured developer's web-stricken mausoleums (some might call them 'studios') in a proud display of artistry, innovation, and diversity. Joining the showcase as a guest host is Samantha Beart, who you might know as Karlach from Baldur's Gate 3—you know, big, tall, capable of punting a mindflayer thirty feet with a well-placed boot. That one. The second part of the event will take place over on Steam with the Halloween Bash Steam Event—live from Octobe…",

If that sounds a little dry and unexciting, well, you've probably got AI fatigue like the rest of us. However, this one may well be worth paying attention to, as it's already revealed a promising new cancer treatment method—which Google describes as \"a milestone for AI in science.\" As Google's blog post details, a major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is the existence of \"cold\" tumors, or tumors that are essentially invisible to the body's immune system. The C2S-Scale 27B model was tasked with finding a drug that could act as a conditional amplifier, or something capable of boosting the immune signal in an environment where low levels of interferon , an immune-signalling protein, were already present—but crucially, not in significant enough quantities to trigger the immune system into doing its job. Essentially, it was looking for a drug that could turn a \"cold\" tumour \"hot\", or susceptible to immunotherapy, when interferon was already in the mix. The model simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs through what the researchers refer to as a \"dual-context virtual screen.\" This had two sta…",

    "body": "My first impressions of the Logitech G321 Lightspeed gaming headset were not positive. It's a noticeably cheaper-feeling headset than the comparably priced Corsair HS55 (this is before mentioning that Corsair's offering is older and regularly reduced). It creaks under pressure, and the speakers in the earcups aren't even padded, meaning you can tap plastic if you poke your finger in there. However, partially due to its choice of materials, the Logitech G321 certainly earns that Lightspeed name by being some of the most breezy cups I've wrapped around my ears as of late. The best way I can think to enunciate what the G321 Lightspeed gets right is to express what I think the Turtle Beach Recon 70 gets wrong. The Recon 70 is a decidedly budget headset at $40, and the headset makes a lot of compromises in regards to build quality and feel. The G321 is $10 more, comes with the same-sized drivers (40 mm), a flip-to-mute microphone, a similar weight, and yet, it feels so much better on the head. It's also wireless. At 210 g, it's not that much lighter than the 231 g Turtle Beach Recon 70 and yet putting both on, a clear winner arises. That's because the parts of the G321 Lightspeed that …",

Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back. The change with the most impact—and the most risk of under-delivering—is with combat. Blizzard says monster behavior was “too predictable,” in a draft of a blog post it provided to PC Gamer, and that it’s tweaking things to give each demon a stronger identity. On paper, this sounds like Diablo 4 combat might actually require some target priority, like taking care of a caster in the backline before the tank in the front.

By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",
