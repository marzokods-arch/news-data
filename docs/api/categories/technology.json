However, some of the details in this megabucks transition are intriguing. Wired has visited just such a facility in the throes of said repurposing and claims, \"across the US, an identical pattern is playing out at bitcoin mining facilities owned by a variety of operators. In the last 18 months, at least eight other publicly traded bitcoin mining companies—Bitfarms, Core Scientific, Riot, IREN, TeraWulf, CleanSpark, Bit Digital, MARA Holdings, and Cipher Mining—have announced plans to pivot either partly or wholly to AI.\" Question is, is that a good thing or a bad thing for PC gaming? Or is the whole situation with PC component prices such a clusterf*** , it really doesn't matter? Well, where things get somewhat interesting is this relatively unassuming observation in the Wired story: “Bitcoin mining created the blueprint for the AI compute boom and the modern data center,” Wired quotes Meltem Demirors, general partner at the VC firm Crucible Capital, saying. “They have found that th…",

With the AMD Adrenalin 25.12.1 driver releasing today, you too can get on the new FSR bandwagon. So long as you have an RDNA 4 card, that is. Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Something else that I need to get out of the way is AMD's bizarre decision to drop any numbering with FSR.

    "body": "In a new blog post, Microsoft says its, \"commitment is to make Windows the best place to game—no matter where you play.\" The company lays out a detailed checklist of all the measures it has taken to make gaming better on the PC in 2025 and name checks a few ideas for the future. It's a substantial roll call. But Windows remains under threat, most obviously from Valve's Steam OS, but also arguably from its own crumminess. Microsoft groups the gaming enhancements it delivered in 2025 into three broad groups: handheld innovation, Windows on Arm, and DirectX. Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally. ASD delivers precompiled shaders at install time, eliminating most of the wait time and stuttering when you launch a game for the first time. Microsoft claims the \"numbers speak for themselves\" when it comes to ASD. \"In Avowed, first-run load time dropped by over 80% and Call of Duty: Black O…",

Lunar Lake in tablet form does very, very well, and its Arc 140V GPU is seriously impressive when it comes to gaming performance. And then there's that gorgeous, bright 11-inch display. But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes. Though maybe that quest for versatility means avoiding those mistakes is…",

So it seems only fitting that the fan translators who did such a marvelous job with that game would wind up getting to do the same for another underappreciated cozy gem—only this time, with official backing. 1999's Milano's Odd Job Collection, out on Steam today , is the first 'legit' project from the fan translators at Hilltop Works, who teamed up with publisher XSeed and emulation-porting house Implicit Conversions to release the game in English for the first time. I think the background of how Milano ended up finally being released in English is maybe even more interesting than the game itself, given how rare it is for fan translations to get the official seal of approval.

According to an Embark X post , the Cold Snap update arrives Tuesday, December 16. According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance?

In the premiere trailer for ReStory, we get a first glimpse at what life would be like running a repair shop in early 2000s Tokyo. Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny. From the few examples we've seen in the trailer, each item you mend feels like an intricate puzzle. You'll have to snap a tonne of individual pieces back together while rot…",

However, it's quite a deceptive first look. Initially, I thought I was looking at a sweet bug-catching simulator, but it quickly pulls in dating sim elements in a significant change of pace. As you run around, you will in fact catch bugs, but it's what you do with them after that gets me excited to play. Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out. The example given in the trailer shows a butterfly and a slug coming together for dinner, but as you watch them interact it turns out there are by no means a compatible pair. So, it's your job as the bug catcher overlord to find the perfect match for each insect. As you watch these date sequences, bugs will express their likes and dislikes, such as a hard shell or a certain amount of eyes. You know, all those features you probably think of every…",

In a new trailer shown during the Wholesome Snack showcase, we get another look at its easygoing lifestyle through some sweeping shots of the towns you'll explore, alongside some familiar faces if you've been enjoying the game in early access. However, if you're yet to explore the world of Cozy Caravan, then you are in for a treat. But, before you can delve in, you need to make an animal avatar. Rather than this being your typical cat or dog, you're given a wonderful selection of critters to choose from too, including an opossum and raccoon, or even an axolotl if you're more keen on amphibians. Once you've made the impossible selection, you'll be unleashed into the game and get to experience what life as a mobile market is like. Unleashed might give the wrong impression, because Cozy Caravan is exactly what its title suggests: an incredibly relaxing game with little to no restrictions or rules. In fact, you use this caravan to set up a travelling market stall where you can stock items you've cr…",

Lenovo on the other hand has apparently told customers that all of its current quotes will expire as of January 1, 2026 (via TrendForce ). Why? You guessed it: memory shortages and surging prices , driven by the demands of big tech's AI pipedreams. HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes.

In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch.

He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.
