Even Hytale, the long-awaited, standalone Minecraft-like due to release into early access Jan. 13, can have its origins traced back to one of the biggest custom Minecraft server networks around, Hypixel . Taking after its foremost inspiration, Hytale has ambitions to let players run wild with a suite of custom game creation tools—and the possibilities the team is showing off are tantalizing. For instance, Hypixel Studios founder and CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme just showed off a brief snippet of a custom game on X . Far from the first-person survival fare you might expect, it's a 2D side-scroller with impressive set dressing. Collins-Flaflamme said in his post that it was made by one of the game's level designers, and \"not a programmer!\" One of our level designers (not a programmer!) did a quick side-scroller for fun in Hytale! pic.twitter.com/GK0zYPprN6 January 11, 2026 It's hard to say how intuitive these tools will be for complete newcomers to modding or level editing, but knowing what modders are capable of when their efforts are concentrated on a single project , I have a feeling we'll be seeing some pretty w…",

An example he gives in the video is RPG romance.

One other use that was shot down definitively, however, is AI-generated text, placeholder or final. User AmihanTheStoic asked about AI text in the context of the no AI art promise. Specifically, how generated placeholder text helps development, and whether \"good enough\" AI placeholder text might make it to the final game, voiding Larian's promise to keep generated assets out of Divinity.

We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity,\" said writing director Adam Smith . \"To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'—it doesn't. \"We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those …",

But after blasting through both Freelancer's budget and its planned two-and-a-half-year development cycle, Digital Anvil was acquired by Microsoft. Roberts left the company shortly after the buyout—though he remained involved with Freelancer as a creative consultant. Freelancer eventually released in 2003, more than three years later than originally planned. Its cinematic, arcade space combat was generally well liked. But the game was also criticised for being simplistic compared to other space sims—a consequence of Microsoft scaling down the project following their acquisition of Digital Anvil. There's always been a cohort of fans who have wondered what Freelancer might have looked like if Roberts realised his initial vision. Now, a subset of that cohort has just released its own, unofficial sequel to Freelancer, developed over a timeframe that makes the original game's creation look rapid by comparison.

For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment.

According to the EC, the European Open Digital Ecosystem Strategy it's looking to create will set out \"a strategic approach to the open source sector in the EU that addresses the importance of open source as a crucial contribution to EU technological sovereignty, security and competitiveness\". \"A strategic and operational framework to strengthen the use, development and reuse of open digital assets within the Commission, building on the results achieved under the 2020–2023 Commission Open Source Software Strategy.\" Judging from the aforementioned Commission Open Source Softwa…",

Wyll, the origin character and (if you're not playing as him) party member, is notoriously a little underbaked. He's so straightforwardly good as to be, well, maybe a little dull, and he even gets outshone by other characters in some of his own big plot scenes—not because of a deficit in his performance, but because of how those scenes were written. It turns out that Wyll's writer, Kevin VanOrd (who also wrote Lae'zel, by the by), knows just how fans feel. In a Q&A on Reddit , VanOrd wrote in response to a question from a disappointed Wyll-liker that \"I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.\" Alas, it sounds like circumstances conspired to make that difficult, if not impossible, to do. \"We weren't connecting with Wyll's early access recruitment and initial questing,\" writes VanOrd, \"so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid.\" Way back when, before BG3 left early access, Wyll was a different sort of character and even had a different actor, Lanre Malaolu .

According to Gigabyte, HyperNits is, \"a smart tuning feature leveraging a unique algorithm to intelligently reshape the EOTF curve. HyperNits boosts brightness by up to 30% while preserving critical highlight detail. Users can choose between HyperNits High for maximum brightness enhancement or HyperNits Medium for a gentle 20% lift in darker environments.\" It's not totally clear, but this very much looks like a similar technical solution to MSI's EOTF Boost feature, as seen in multiple MSI OLED monitors, including and most recently the excellent MSI MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 I reviewed a week or so ago. If it's not too recursive to quote myself, I explained then that, \"EOTF or Electro-Optical Transfer Function is essentially the map that determines how electrical signals are translated into actual light output on a display and it's particularly important for getting HD…",

Stoakes then replied to Dave Hansen, kernel hacker at Intel, saying, \"We're noticing a lot more LLM slop than we used to. It is becoming more and more of an issue.\" Stoakes argues LLMs have had a negative impact in many areas, \"for which you need only take a cursory glance at the world to observe\". Furthering this point, Stoakes says, \"Thinking LLMs are 'just another tool' is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.\" This is where Torvalds comes into the conversation . He says, \"No. Your position is the silly one. There is *zero* point in talking about AI slop.

Embark Studios hasn't confirmed a roadmap for Arc Raiders yet, but there are some things we're very likely to see, at the very least, before 2027 creeps up on us. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Following on from the last few months, I'd bet that raiders will get to experience new map conditions, weapons, arc mobs, raider decks, and hopefully even some new community events. When it comes to map conditions, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a desert condition sometime in the summer, like the Cold Snap , but in reverse. I'd also like to see something like a Wacky Raid, where the arc behaviour is really weird, the mobs spawn in locations you'd usually not find them in, and the loot makes absolutely no sense for where you'd find it. It sounds fun (and horrifying) finding a leaper wedged into the hallways of Dam Control Tower, although that's likely a pipe dream. But you know what isn't? New mobs. From the beginning, pl…",

That being said, a lack of real competition is the root of complacency, and I for one would like to see Steam continue to improve, especially as it invades the living room with its second and much more promising attempt at the Steam Machine . So, I rallied some PC Gamers, we bashed our heads together, and came up with a list of nine things we'd like Steam to add in 2026. More detailed options for Steam reviews Can you guess the game?

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess. As was prophesied, Larian kicked off its Q&A —with Vincke and a load of other studio honchos—earlier today. One key takeaway? Larian's swearing off using gen AI tools in concept art development. \"First off—there is not going to be any gen AI art in Divinity,\" wrote Vincke. \"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration.

The just possibly good news is that, in a new interview, AMD has left the door ever so slightly ajar for that happening in future. For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results.

Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience.
