Video: AI and our energy future In May, MIT Technology Review published an unprecedented and comprehensive look at how much energy the AI industry uses—down to a single query. Our reporters and editors traced where AI’s carbon footprint stands now, and where it’s headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users. We’ve just produced a short video to accompany that investigation. You can read the original full story here , and check out—and share— the full video on YouTube here . AI is changing the grid. Could it help more than it harms? The rising popularity of AI is driving an increase in electricity demand so significant it has the potential to reshape the grid. Energy consumption by data centers has gone up by 80% from 2020 to 2025 and is likely to keep growing. Electricity prices are already rising, especially in places where data centers are most concentrated.&nbsp; Yet many people, especially in Big Tech, argue that AI will be, on balance, a positive force for the grid. They claim that the technology could help get more cl…",

The airline suffered weeks of disruptions, leading to $500 million in losses and 7,000 canceled flights. The magnitude of the CrowdStrike incident revealed just how interconnected digital systems are, and the extensive vulnerabilities in some companies when confronted with an unexpected occurrence. “On any given day, there could be a major weather event or some event like what happened…with CrowdStrike,” said then-US secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg on announcing an investigation into how Delta Air Lines handled the incident. “The question is, is your airline prepared to absorb something like that and get back on…",

They’ll provide mental-health care for millions, unimpeded by the pesky requirements for human counselors, like the need for graduate degrees, malpractice insurance, and sleep. Down here on Earth, something very different has been happening.&nbsp; Last week, we published a story about people finding out that their therapists were secretly using ChatGPT during sessions. In some cases it wasn’t subtle; one therapist accidentally shared his screen during a virtual appointment, allowing the patient to see his own private thoughts being typed into ChatGPT in real time. The model then suggested responses that his therapist parroted.&nbsp; It’s my favorite AI story as of late, probably because it captures so well the chaos that can unfold when people actually use AI the way tech companies have all but told them to. As the writer of the story, Laurie Clarke, points out, it’s not a total pipe dream that AI could be therapeutically useful. Early this year, I wrote about the first clinical trial of an AI bot built specifically for therapy. The results were promising! But the secretive use by t…",

Introducing: our 35 Innovators Under 35 list for 2025 The world is full of extraordinary young people brimming with ideas for how to crack tough problems. Every year, we recognize 35 such individuals from around the world—all of whom are under the age of 35. These scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs are working to help mitigate climate change, accelerate scientific progress, and alleviate human suffering from disease. Some are launching companies while others are hard at work in academic labs. They were selected from hundreds of nominees by expert judges and our newsroom staff.&nbsp; Get to know them all—including our 2025 Innovator of the Year— in these profiles .

We’ve just published the 2025 edition . This year, though, the context is pointedly different: The US scientific community finds itself in an unprecedented position, with the very foundation of its work under attack .&nbsp; Since Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has fired top government scientists , targeted universities individually and academia more broadly , and made substantial funding cuts to the country’s science and technology infrastructure . It has also upended longstanding rights and norms related to free speech, civil rights, and immigration—all of which further affects the overall environment for research and innovation in science and technology.&nbsp; We wanted to understand how these changes are affecting the careers and work of our most recent classes of innovators.

To be treated properly, they must first get diagnoses—which means having their genomes sequenced. This process typically takes up to seven weeks. Sadly, that’s often too slow to save a critically ill child. Hospitals may soon have a faster option, thanks to a groundbreaking system built in part by Sneha Goenka , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton—and MIT Technology Review ’s 2025 Innovator of the Year.&nbsp; Five years ago, Goenka and her colleagues designed a rapid-sequencing pipeline that can provide a genetic diagnosis in less than eight hours. Goenka’s software computations and hardware architectures were critical to speeding up each stage of the process.&nbsp; “Her work made everyone realize that genome sequencing is not only for research and medical application in the future but can have immediate impact on patient care,” says Jeroen de Ridder , a professor at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, who has developed an ultrafast se…",
