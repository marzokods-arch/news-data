At The Game Awards 2025, we got a brief teaser trailer for Fate of the Old Republic, a follow-up to the original games whose development will be headed up by Casey Hudson, project lead on KotOR 1 and the Mass Effect trilogy. The trailer shows an Unreal Engine-rendered star ship—not the original games' Ebon Hawk—piloted to a remote, snowy world. Its pilot and passengers, which include a droid resembling the HK series from KotOR, emerge and approach a downed Sith capital ship from the Old Republic games. There are any number of directions Hudson and co. could go with the story: KotOR 2 had a very vague, open-ending conclusion that has since been elaborated on in various bits and bobs of Star Wars lore crafting, most notably some of the expansions to the long-running Old Republic MMO, but that feels like the sort of stuff you can just treat as a suggestion. Lucasfilm Games and developer Arcanaut Studios are calling Fate of the Old Republic a \"spiritual successor\" to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

To put the cash to one side for a moment, over 200 Disney characters will now be used in OpenAI's products. This includes Mickey Mouse as well as more recent characters like Moana, and then there's Star Wars (the likes of Luke Skywalker included), Marvel, and the Pixar catalogue. Hey, has anyone here seen Wall-E? There is one very notable caveat to the agreement: Disney specifies it \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\" There are a host of obvious reasons why: primarily the likely objection of said talent, such as Mark Hamill, and the inevitable battle for rights that would ensue. Plus you get into a real grey area with characters like Mickey, who was for decades voiced by Walt Disney himself. I appreciate the following sentence may make some raise a cartoon eyebr…",

Patch 1.6.0 targets four specific issues: Removing the zipline on Stella Montis that lets players go out of bounds. Fixing a collision that let players get through a wall in Blue Gate. Fixing material issues, which meant bullets or arcs' vision weren't blocked by some objects. Patching a gap at the Spaceport Launch Tower, which allowed players to get shot through a wall.

    "body": "Apparently, there's no more money in mining . It's perhaps not a huge surprise, therefore, to learn that some of the largest bitcoin operations in the US are pivoting away from mining to AI processing. However, some of the details in this megabucks transition are intriguing. Wired has visited just such a facility in the throes of said repurposing and claims, \"across the US, an identical pattern is playing out at bitcoin mining facilities owned by a variety of operators. In the last 18 months, at least eight other publicly traded bitcoin mining companies—Bitfarms, Core Scientific, Riot, IREN, TeraWulf, CleanSpark, Bit Digital, MARA Holdings, and Cipher Mining—have announced plans to pivot either partly or wholly to AI.\" Question is, is that a good thing or a bad thing for PC gaming? Or is the whole situation with PC component prices such a clusterf*** , it really doesn't matter? Well, where things get somewhat interesting is this relatively unassuming observation in the Wired story: “Bitcoin mining created the blueprint for the AI compute boom and the modern data center,” Wired quotes Meltem Demirors, general partner at the VC firm Crucible Capital, saying. “They have found that th…",

    "body": "It's been almost seven months since it was first announced, but at long last, AMD's much-vaunted machine learning-powered update to FSR is finally here. With the AMD Adrenalin 25.12.1 driver releasing today, you too can get on the new FSR bandwagon. So long as you have an RDNA 4 card, that is. Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Something else that I need to get out of the way is AMD's bizarre decision to drop any numbering with FSR. For example, FSR 4 was announced in February and brought AI-powered upscaling to games on RDNA 4 graphics cards. That's now simply called AMD FSR Upscaling. But that's al…",

It's a substantial roll call. But Windows remains under threat, most obviously from Valve's Steam OS, but also arguably from its own crumminess. Microsoft groups the gaming enhancements it delivered in 2025 into three broad groups: handheld innovation, Windows on Arm, and DirectX. Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally. ASD delivers precompiled shaders at install time, eliminating most of the wait time and stuttering when you launch a game for the first time. Microsoft claims the \"numbers speak for themselves\" when it comes to ASD. \"In Avowed, first-run load time dropped by over 80% and Call of Duty: Black O…",

Lunar Lake in tablet form does very, very well, and its Arc 140V GPU is seriously impressive when it comes to gaming performance. And then there's that gorgeous, bright 11-inch display. But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes. Though maybe that quest for versatility means avoiding those mistakes is…",
