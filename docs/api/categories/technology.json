Created over seven years by solo developer Adam Gwynaire, Neyyah transports players to not one but several remote islands dotted with strange plant life and mysterious structures. Like Myst, it's a first-person point and click adventure that involves reactivating arcane machinery by solving puzzles that interconnect in obscure ways. There's a trailer for the game below.

Sometimes, instead of staying devoted to our highest purpose as videogame enthusiasts‚Äîtyping the words \"Half-Life 3?\" into the Twitch or YouTube chat box during any and every livestreamed event‚Äîwe get distracted. Hollow Knight: Silksong was very distracting. Announced, then vanished, then resurfaced and re-vanished in such a way as to inspire waves of hope, despair and development hell conspiracy theories. Half-Life 3 had to earn its place as the mystical ur-announcement, the unlikeliest of hoped-for \"One last thing\" bombshells to trot out at the end of a Game Awards or E3 keynote, by not existing for decades. Silksong took a mere five years to run the same cycle. And the whole time it was a real game! That realness made the possibility of Silksong popping up in every single Nintendo Direct, Gamescom Opening Night Live, or Sony State of Play seem so tantalizingly possible. ‚Ä¶",

Prey‚Äîthe original‚Äîwas developed by Human Head Studios and released in 2006, and it was quite good.
