    "body": "Google just made a shocking announcement: Android’s Quick Share now works with Apple AirDrop . For many years, Apple users have complained that they can’t easily AirDrop files to their Android friends, pressuring Android users into buying iPhones. So for Google to come out and say they’re rolling out an update that makes Quick Share compatible with AirDrop is huge news. Amidst today’s news blitz, there was nary a peep from Apple about its role in making AirDrop compatible with Quick Share. You would think that such a big interoperability play would involve Apple. After all, Google and Apple worked in tandem to bring RCS messaging and unknown tracker alerts to both Android and iOS. However, it seems that Apple had no interest in helping Google make Quick Share compatible with AirDrop.",

    "body": "In its never-ending quest to defeat OpenAI, Google is trying all sorts of tactics to get people to switch from ChatGPT to Gemini . One of its best weapons in this fight is Nano Banana , Google’s AI image generation and editing model. It went insanely viral after launch, so Google has leaned hard on it, promoting it on as many platforms as possible. To maintain this momentum, Google has launched Nano Banana Pro, a significantly improved version of its AI image model. I had the opportunity to test this new model prior to launch, and I think it’s going to become a Photoshop replacement for image editing beginners like myself. I’ve been using the original Nano Banana for a variety of things since it launched in late August. From modifying our existing stock images to seamlessly add new text, to generating eye-catching thumbnails for our Authority Insights Podcast , Nano Banana has been an immensely useful tool for my work. There’s no doubt that it does an incredible job at creating and modifying images — it wouldn’t have gone viral if it was terrible, after all.",

These cuts follow roughly 20,000 prior job losses over three years and represent one of the largest single reductions in Verizon’s history.

While T-Mobile has yet to unveil its news, Verizon has now officially announced its plans, as first noted by Bloomberg and confirmed by Verizon .

A new string we discovered in the 2511 Android Canary build reveals a setting to link the mode across connected devices. When enabled, toggling Airplane Mode on your phone will automatically trigger it on your watch via Bluetooth. Most mobile devices feature a one-tap Airplane Mode that disables wireless radios. While designed to prevent interference with aircraft communications, many people also use the feature on the ground to preserve battery life. Although enabling Airplane Mode is simple, Android phones and Wear OS watches don’t currently sync this state. You must remember to toggle it on both devices individually. If you forget one, your device may needlessly drain its battery searching for a cellular signal at 30,000 feet. To solve this, Google is working on a new setting that syncs Airplane Mode between your devices.",

When Apple released iOS 17 about two years ago, it added a feature that instantly garnered a lot of attention. The feature allowed iPhone users to tap and hold on any image to select the subject and convert it into a sticker that can be used across different messaging apps or used as a separate background-free image. It became an instant hit, which prompted Android manufacturers, including Samsung , Xiaomi, and OnePlus, to follow suit and bring it to their respective photo gallery apps. Besides these brands, Google also implemented a similar functionality in Photos to make it more widely accessible, but limited it to iOS users at the time of its launch earlier this year. On the sidelines, however, it has been testing the functionality for Android users and is now making progress toward making it a reality.",

The X-59, designed to fly at supersonic speeds and reduce the sound of loud sonic booms to quieter sonic thumps, took off at 11:14 a.m. EDT and flew for 67 minutes. The flight represents a major step toward quiet supersonic flight over land. “Once again, NASA and America are leading the way for the future of flight,” said acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “The X-59 is the first of its kind, and a major breakthrough in America’s push toward commercial air travel that’s both quiet and faster than ever before. Thanks to the X-59 team’s innovation and hard work, we’re revolutionizing air travel. This machine is a prime example of the kind of ingenuity and dedication America produces.” Following a short taxi from contractor Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility, NASA X-59 test pilot Nils Larson approached U.S. Air Force Plant 42’s runway in Palmdale, California, where…",

Google knows that smartphones don’t exist in a world by themselves, and over the years the company’s shown its willingness to promote both Android itself and Pixel devices with the help of some timely media tie-ins. Maybe that means showing off its AR tech with some help from The Mandalorian, or using the cameras on Pixel phones to record the highlights from the NBA All-Star Weekend.
