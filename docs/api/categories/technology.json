As it gets ready for that hardware, we’re taking a look at the companion software that will exist on the phone side. Features in development include an audio-only mode, conversation detection to mute notifications, and privacy-protecting camera tools. At CES this year, smart glasses were everywhere , and if you haven’t tried a pair on yet, you’ll probably have the chance to soon. But for all the great progress we’re seeing across all things XR, we’re easily most excited about what’s coming next from Google. As we get ready to experience all the flavors of Google’s latest attempt at making smart glasses work , we’re getting an early peek at the software that may make this all possible.

On Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro , and 3a Lite, the update included a feature called Lock Glimpse, a widely panned addition that served ads on those phones’ lock screens. Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it. That solution wasn’t satisfactory, though, as users found the software was draining their batteries even when turned off . Today, Nothing shared that the feature is being removed from the 3a series (except the 3a Lite) as of the Nothing OS 4.0 December update.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Bixby could be getting a real AI upgrade in One UI 8.5 by handing complex questions to Perplexity AI. We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

    "body": "TL;DR xMEMS is showing off its µCooling system that uses ultrasonic speakers to move air. The system is silent, water-resistant, and can small enough to be used in wearables. A ducted µCooling solution for phones could move up to 0.1 cubic feet of air a minute. Heat is arguably the biggest enemy of modern processors. We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down. As a result, nearly every device we use has to make some sort of balance between performance and thermal emissions. This year at CES in Las Vegas , we’re learning about an innovative new way that xMEMS is trying to tackle that problem, giving even compact mobile devices another option for staying cool.

    "summary": "Google is solving the biggest Calling Card complaint on Android.",
    "body": "TL;DR We’ve managed to enable the upcoming “My Calling Card” feature in Google’s Phone app. You can now create your own Calling Card, choose a photo, customize fonts, and control who sees it. If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",
