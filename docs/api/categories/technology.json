I, on the other hand, am preoccupied with a different type of resolution: camera resolution. Alright, that was a terrible way to jump into my topic, but I’ll stand by it because it’s true. What I really mean is that the things we can do with modern smartphone cameras are downright remarkable. We can take telephoto-zoomed macro shots, insert ourselves into images in-camera, and even reimagine the sky if we’re stuck on a gray, cloudy day. However, one thing seems to get worse with every attempt to improve it, and I think we need to step back.",

The telephoto camera is expected to remain largely the same, though the periscope zoom could receive a wider aperture. These rumored changes follow years of criticism regarding Samsung’s minimal hardware evolution in its flagship imaging systems. Samsung’s flagships have undergone minimal hardware evolution over the years, particularly in the camera department. The upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to disappoint with the same camera hardware, and super early leaks for the Galaxy S27 Ultra also painted the same picture. However, a new leak suggests that Samsung might finally stop being so lazy and actually provide us with a camera upgrade in the Galaxy S27 Ultra.

The phone adds Proton apps inside a locked-down Vault, while still allowing wider app access through a Wild Web section. Pricing starts at €699 with one year of service included, followed by a paid subscription for AphyOS features. Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows. It’s a cleaner way of formalising something many privacy-conscious users already do manually by keeping safe apps separate from e…",

That moment came recently when I started thinking about moving away from Google’s services. It wasn’t because I disliked them; I was simply curious whether I could simplify my setup or reduce my reliance on one company. But as someone who reviews multiple smartphones every year — and constantly switches between iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac — it didn’t take long to realise that walking away from Google would make my workflow significantly more chaotic.",

Today, a new report includes some key details about the project, which could be some kind of AI-integrated pen. According to a tweet from industry tipster Smart Pikachu , OpenAI’s forthcoming gadget will “likely” be produced by Foxconn, the contract manufacturer that assembles products like the iPhone and recent Pixel phone models. The tweet goes on to say that the initiative could take the shape of “a pen” and/or “a ‘to-go’ audio device.”",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

We’re just about one week away from CES 2026 getting started, and tech companies have already been lining up to tease their new hardware announcements ahead of time. Last year, at CES 2025, we saw Roborock push the limits on what we’ve come to expect from robot vacuum hardware with the reveal of the Saros Z70 and its articulated arm for picking up small items. Today we’re getting a preview of how Roborock is planning to follow that one up, and it sure looks like the next frontier for the company’s vacuums could be navigating stairs.
