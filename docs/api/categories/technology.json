    "body": "When I'm playing Arc Raiders , one of the things I'm most struck by is just how cinematic it is. I'm creeping through sand-swept streets at night as gunshots ring out in the distance and flares start flying, then all of a sudden a Rocketeer starts hounding me in and out of houses, and I narrowly escape down a subway. It's impressive, especially for a multiplayer game. Some creative players took advantage of this and traded guns for binoculars, making incredible on-field reporting and even short films , all recorded inside the game—no CGI or greenscreen required. I suppose it was only a matter of time, then, until Hollywood tried to capitalise on Arc Raiders' sudden success. As Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund explains in a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the team has already received offers to adapt gaming's latest hit to the big screen, even though it's barely even two months old at this point. \"I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series or movie out of this IP\", Söderlund says, without naming any names. Söderlund goes on to clarify, \"We don't mind doing that, it would be fun. But it has to be done in the right wa…",

I've encountered bloodthirsty raiders who'd fit better in a colosseum rather than Stella Montis, who have challenged me to axe-to-axe combat on threat of death, voiceless raiders who use voice prompts to help me find hidden loot, and battle medics who manage to pop out of thin air to revive me when I get downed by a rogue arc, it seems like Arc Raiders is a sandbox for all sorts of social adventures.

According to Intel fellow Tom Peterson, its figures are now 'slightly north' of 100 million. \"We have shipped 100 million [AI PCs] already\" said Petersen, at an Intel briefing I attended earlier today. \"We've been doing this now for a couple of years, started off with Meteor Lake, and now Lunar Lake.

However, as I'm on the ground at CES 2026, Intel gave me a chance earlier today to put the Arc B390 iGPU through its paces in a brief benchmarking session. I have to say, its performance was pretty impressive—for an integrated graphics solution, at the very least. Due to my packed CES schedule (my fault entirely), I had less than an hour to quickly run some benchmarks and futz around in the odd game. Still, I'm enough of an old hand to know exactly what game I was benching first— Cyberpunk 2077 , of course. My test laptop was a non-descript Lenovo machine with an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H onboard, the top-end Panther Lake CPU from the new lineup. Still, the lack of discrete graphics hardware means I didn't subject the poor lappy to path tracing, or even ultra settings, at least at first. No, this is an iGPU, and expectations should be tempered—Intel says the Arc B390 is around 10% faster on average than an Nvidia RTX 4050, and that's not exactly a lightning-fast graphics card. High settings then, 1200p. No upscaling, no ray tracing. The result? (Image credit: Future) A perfectly …",

Now the two lands exist side by side, but anyone who crosses from one to the other is transformed, no longer quite the same person (or elf or boggart) they were on the other side. This duality is demonstrated in a short film called One Light, One Dark that's basically a Magic-themed Muppet musical, with characters designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop singing about how different their lives are on either side of the twilight border. On the one side, they playfully squeeze frogs. On the other, they murder pigeons. Swings and roundabouts, really. It's delightful is what it is. And while it's also a perfect opportunity for the Fun Police to say how this proves Magic is better when it concentrates on its original setting rather than crossovers, I think I'd be even more stoked if this was a Muppets/Labyrinth/Dark Crystal set.

HyperX is now teaming up with start-up Neurable to develop a gaming headset that can also function a bit like an EEG. Why? Apparently in a bid to \" help players improve their focus and accuracy by interpreting brain activity in real time .\" And, before you ask, the thing doing the interpreting will of course be AI. Neurable develops proprietary AI that it claims \"makes it possible to integrate BCIs into everyday products creating a future where technology anticipates and responds to human intention.\" The company is already offering pre-orders for its MW75 …",

    "body": "AMD has teased the launched of a new Ryzen processor with two chiplets, each of which will include a healthy dollop of 3D V-Cache. As reported by ComputerBase , AMD told journalists to \"stay tuned\" regarding the launch of such a chip. If this wasn't convincing enough, Alienware China has announced a new Area-51 gaming PC with the new chip, which it notes as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D2. Furthermore, system builder Systronix has also listed a workstation with the chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 will likely deliver 16 cores, 32 threads and 192 MB of total L3 cache. All of which not only suggests the chip is set to launch, it's happening sometime soon, and it probably should have been included in AMD's CES 2026 announcements. Its absence is a little strange, as AMD had to lean pretty heavily on the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and new Ryzen AI Max chips to (barely) carry the show for gamers. Though this isn't the first time AMD has pulled a product announcement from CES at the last moment; anyone remember the missing RX 9000-series GPUs of last year? Though is the Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 for gamers? You'd think so, considering the abundance of cache on X3D processors as the main driver of their world-class gaming pe…",

At first, I thought it wasn't worth the investment , back before Embark revealed all the details about what we were getting, but once it announced the $5 million for five skill points and the unique skin, I came around to the idea of Presitiging despite a lot of community grumbling . Embark definitely should've announced the details sooner, but at least we all know in advance this season, so it's easier to grind that five mil if you feel inclined. Like many, I didn't have enough cash or time to get all five skill points (I only got three), but I wanted to experience the Expedition first hand. So I packed off my Raider, retired them to a nice farm upstate, and definitely didn't feel bad about effectively sending them to the glue factory for some tasty benefits. Even when I finished the Expedition, I wasn't sure if it was ultimately going to be worth it. The unique skin seemed nice and all ,…",

The game's lead game designer Michel Nohra confesses that they might've gone a little astray, there, per an interview with Edge magazine for Issue 419 (thanks, Gamesradar ): \"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now.\" See, while it's a safe assumption that Clair Obscur lets you keep playing after the credits roll, it's also a safe assumption that you're meant to do a little exploring first—more than that, Nohra explains, most players keep the final boss as a motivating carrot on the end of a stick: \"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content.

The members in question included Tom's Hardware , which reported on the Q&A session, and it was AMD's president of GPU Technologies and Chief Software Officer, Andrej Zdravković, who provided the pertinent answers. Tom's writes that, \"The software head responded that the accidental public release in August was unexpected, but that it intends to release the source for the FSR4 library while keeping the core technology closed, so as not to give Nvidia engineers an advantage.\" Technically, that's already happened, as back in August 2025, somebody at AMD accidentally uploaded source code for the FidelityFX SDK to GitHub , before swiftly removing it.

That's why in the bleak midwinter when the last thing I want to do is go outside, I look for games like the demo of Flock Around which let me birdwatch without feeling the bitter cold.

I guess via possession? The \"ghost character\" who provides \"ghost assistance\" will be based on footage of other players, presumably scraped from YouTube by AI. There's already a Game Help feature on Playstation 5 that can bring up relevant videos when you're stuck, and this seems like a less jarring implementation of that.
