Arc Raiders was planned as a free-to-play game for the majority of its lengthy development, but in late 2024, Embark pivoted to a traditional paid model . In a recent interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi , Embark founder Patrick Söderlund reflected on the decision, and said it was easier to cut against the grain of free-to-play after witnessing the success of other premium multiplayer games like Helldivers 2. \"It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'\" Söderlund said. \"We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue.

In a new interview with Games Beat , Embark's CEO Patrick Söderlund went into some detail on how the studio built the game's maps, and the big surprise for me was how closely they hew to certain real world inspirations. \"[Dam Battlegrounds] is the second one we made,\" says Söderlund. \"To get the first iteration done probably takes weeks before it's playable but ugly and then it takes… I think we probably spent 6 months on this map to playtest it and make it playable.\" \"The real work is actually making sure the map plays well.

Case in point is my reaction upon hearing about the \"most powerful gaming laptop on the planet\"— 'ooh!' —followed by the immediate dual recognition that this will be very expensive and probably very loud and scarcely worth unplugging from the mains— 'oh, yeah' . It is undeniably impressive, however, that MSI is packing very powerful hardware in such a small form factor. The company says about the Raider 16 Max HX and Raider 16 HX: \"Don’t let its size fool you. The Raider 16 Max HX is the world’s first gaming laptop capable of delivering a massive 300W total system power. Under full-load conditions, it unleashes 175W to the RTX 5090 or 5080, while simultaneously feeding 125W to the Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor—making it the most powerful gaming laptop on the planet.\" What's also impressive, and a welcome seeming trend for CES this year, is an element of modularity to these Raider laptops.

Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

I'll help us get started: There seem to be the slight rumblings of a focus on local rather than cloud AI by the big hardware companies, which could spell good news for the PC gaming industry and, dare I say it, the memory market. Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point.

Meanwhile, Asus is also announcing a 27-inch 4K model, this time with LG's newest panel tech. And what both panels share is RGB stripe subpixels. Previously, Samsung's QD-OLED panels have used RGB—or red, green and blue—subpixels, but arranged in an unusual triangular pattern instead of the vertical \"stripes\" seen in pretty much all LCD monitors. LG's OLED tech has actually used vertical stripe subpixels, but with an additional white subpixel, hence the \"WOLED\" branding. In both cases, not using a standard RGB stripe subpixel arrangement can cause problems whenever subpixel addressing is used for rendering, most obviously with text and fonts.

    "body": "Last year Corsair stepped into the world of enthusiast keyboards with the MAKR 75 , an incredibly well-made bit of kit that unfortunately failed to garner more than a 70% score from our reviewer Phil Iwaniuk. Now there's a new version, and this one might go at least some way towards boosting that up. That's primarily because this is a Hall effect keyboard. One of Phil's problems with the first version was that it all added up to quite a lot of money after adding the various parts to the DIY kit, and you didn't have the option to get Hall effect switches for that price tag. The just-announced MAKR Pro 75, though, has Hall effect switches, and they're included in its price tag… which is still steep at $250/£220, so it's not exactly a clear value improvement overall from first glance. For those who want Hall effect switches in a dinky 75% form factor that thocks as good as many other enthusiast keyboards, it should be a good shout, though. Phil said the non-Pro has a \"tank-like chassis construction\", and it looks like that'll be the same with the new one, too. Apart from the chassis, we're talking an FR4 plate, gasket mounting, and 8-layer sound dampening, which will all help that so…",

CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. A concept model of Project Ava was first unveiled during CES last year , billing the AI assistant as an esports coach (or, as Jacob astutely put it then, a 'backseat gaming AI bot'). This year, it's venturing from the realm of software and acquiring a physical form, with Razer announcing plans to bring Project Ava to a desk near you as an animated, holographic 'desk companion'. The desk companion version of Project Ava looks not unlike the sort of sci-fi container where many a wayward life form has inevitably found itself. Test tube looks aside, the headline act of this hardware is the holographic display in the middle. The device also deploys an HD camera with eye-tracking, plus a far-field mic to fulfill its coaching duties. PC…",

Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades.

(Image credit: Jinko on YouTube) My first encounter with one was at the Swamp Extraction at Dam Battlegrounds. I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim. Needless to say, these weapons are way too lethal against other raiders, and have for some time now created quite the headache in lobbies. But this may all be behind us now.

Notably, Dell isn't offering discrete graphics options with the new laptops, the implication being that the iGPU in the new Panther Lake CPU makes that unnecessary. Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper. Dell has also added subtle etching on the otherwise seamless glass trackpad panel below the keyboard, again addressing a design issue with the previous XPS design, which left users guessing exactly w…",
