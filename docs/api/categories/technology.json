    "body": "Of the many challenges facing our home, the good ship planet Earth, surely none is greater than the fact our Steam libraries won't organise themselves properly. If you own the Assassin's Creed or Yakuza games, you know what I'm talking about: Steam's rigid alphabetisation of your library means that series are presented out of order. For instance, Yakuza Kiwami (which is Yakuza 1) comes after Yakuza 6, and Assassin's Creed Odyssey comes before AC Origins. Psychological torture. But our long national nightmare is over: as of September 9th's Steam mega-update , the client has a new feature to put an end to it. \"Added a Customization tab to game properties,\" read the patch notes. \"The Customization tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library.\" In other words, you can now set what is effectively a hidden name for all your games that Steam will use to sort them. So I could label the 12 Assassin's Creed games in my library as Assassin's Creed 1 through 12 to have them display in proper release order*, but the display names of the games themselves in my library woul…",

Anyway, I've prescribed myself one \"play a game that doesn't hurt your hands\", and I've landed on Letters to Arralla —an adorable upcoming game by Little Pink Clouds where you play a turnip with a fat ass. Also, you have mail to deliver. I technically should've led with that, the butt is entirely secondary. From what I've played of the demo, Letters is a delightful little puzzle-exploration sim with a Stardew-esque roster of freaky veggie friends to deliver letters to. Unlike in the real world, where opening someone else's mail is a very serious crime, it's encouraged on Arralla—because it'll give you insight into all your little veggie friends. Plus they don't seem to mind. It's part of the culture, I guess, even if I did feel bad for peeling off all their mates' cute little stickers.

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

    "body": "The indie studio that took on the might of Monster Energy , and won, is having the hit game at the center of the dispute adapted into a movie. Deadline reports that Glowstick Entertainment has inked a deal for its survival horror game Dark Deception to be adapted into a feature film by indie production outfit So It Goes Entertainment. Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters). Monster throws its considerab…",

So when AMD swapped from using SK Hynix to Samsung GDDR6 memory in its new Radeon RX 9060 XT GPUs, gamers were quick to jump to performance comparisons between them. What they found was a drop when moving over to the new Samsung memory, and gamers were quick to condemn the change. Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption. According to these tests the Samsung memory garnered temperatures 10°C lower than its SK Hynix counterpart, allowing for an almost 400 rpm drop in fan speeds. This means the S…",

Yet if you happened to bounce off the game because of its story—something I couldn't rightly blame you for—you might be surprised to find out that all of its DLC is… actually pretty good, all-told, and there's a lot of it. Four solidly-stacked campaigns you might've entirely missed. While Borderlands 3's insistently wonky plot is otherwise a real obstacle, all of these DLCs stick to a theme and largely nail it. None of these things are winning BAFTAs, mind, but they all spin enjoyable yarns. More importantly, they don't oscillate between outdated memes and unsuccessful melodrama—they just grab a solid pitch and run with it. The first of these, Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot , sees you teaming up with Moxxi to raid Handsome Jack's abandoned casino—alongside a cast of characters including Timothy, who was Jack's doppelganger in …",

This, unlike program copyright works, which seemingly can. The legal battle between the two companies didn't begin with this, though.

For a while, game director Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) has promised that this'll be changing in 8.0 , FF14's next expansion. Back in 2024, he stated: \"By strongly differentiating the jobs, we will be able to reach the goal we have set ourselves.\" It is now 2025, however, and a recent PCGamesN interview from Gamescom is casting doubt. As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.
