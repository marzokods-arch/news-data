One enlightening subject is writer and quest designer Mark Nelson, who was responsible for a chunk of Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, as well as fleshing out the starter village of Seyda Neen. He's the guy responsible for Tarhiel, the wizard who memorably falls out of the sky in front of you the moment you leave, for instance. And he's also the one to blame for The Lusty Argonian Maid , a tiny joke text that's become a core part of the Elder Scrolls' identity. In a game full of serious books about history and theology and philosophy, it's delightful to stumble across one that's a silly sex comedy. \"I don't even remember why I wrote it,\" Nelson admits in the interview. \"It may have been after like a happy hour or something, quite ho…",

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more. For example, it adds more than 30 animations that were included in console versions but not on PC, which will make you look much cooler while you're shooting a minigun or running with the rocket launcher equipped.

No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game. Its open world may have been ahead of the curve back in 2003, but even when I first played it as a socially awkward 15-year-old (the primary audience for Postal games) I could see through the fountains of blood and voluminous arcs …",

A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore. The headline update is a New Game Plus mode, which resets the game …",

Such is the case with Battlefield 6: Technical director Christian Buhl told IGN that Ripple Effect ( formerly DICE LA ) \"did not want leaks,\" but it did want as much feedback from players as possible—and that meant rolling the dice. \"We had, actually, discussions, I think about a year or two ago,\" Buhl said. \"I guess it was maybe about two years ago, about how much we were going to do to prevent leaks versus how much we were going to do to get the game in front of players.

By the time the mobile edition of Balatro launched in late 2024, he was \"well and truly burned out.\" \"I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work,\" LocalThunk wrote. \"However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in cru…",

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.
