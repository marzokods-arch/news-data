I'd like to say I'll remember these moments forever, but no, my brain will unfortunately eject them at some point. Thankfully, there are a few players who are willing to put guns to the side and bring out the humble pair of binoculars to record and document all the action Topside. It's the only valid use for the binoculars, and I'll not be convinced otherwise. My favourites so far have been War Tapes by 0biwanKenobi and Podgor's Scenes from the Topside . They're like war reporters, and they take their jobs very seriously—I respect how these videos are framed as if they're in-world reports from the surface. With plenty of claustrophobic angles and shaky cam, and lathered with VHS noise and retro colour correction, these 'documentaries' perfectly capture the intensity of fighting Arcs and players while also roughly matching Arc Raid…",

The problem being, these combat mods are often used for things other than raw, sweaty, glorious DPS and efficiency. For example, cleaning up visual noise and making the game more accessible. Or, in some cases, just customising superficial elements of the UI to your liking—whether to combat colour blindness or for the aesthetic. And given how public Blizzard tends to be with WoW's betas, there's been a lot of hand-wringing. See, Blizzard's taken a sort of 'wipe the slate clean, then pare it back' approach. It's easier for UI designers to come down hard, then slowly make exceptions based on feedback. But given the enormity of this change, some players are getting a touch skittish.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter.

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",

Hence, Anthropic is committing to buy up $30 billion worth of Azure compute capacity, while Microsoft has agreed to invest $5 billion back into Anthropic, and Nvidia will also offer up $10 billion to Claude's creator. It's almost more money than my bog-standard grey matter wants to compute. But back to silicon—Nvidia says it will also collaborate with Anthropic at a technical level.

It's very sharp and stylish, and Mielgo wants you (as in, everyone ) to know that it was not made using generative AI. \"I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI.

The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, at least among folks who've bought the DLC.

It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.
