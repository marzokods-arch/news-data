It's a short line from the end of the original campaign after defeating Lilith where she says, \"Without me, you would have no victory.\" Apparently, she meant that literally because Blizzard has confirmed that she's coming back for one final showdown. You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",

Case in point, Framework announced it would be raising the price of its DDR5 memory modules for its laptops by 50% to account for the spiking costs the modular laptop brand is seeing from memory distributors and suppliers. That's not even the wildest part, with Framework going on to clarify that its new pricing \"remains below what is available in the open market \" (link original). Previously, Framework had called out Dell and Apple for 'gouging customers' over their memory price hikes, while remaining upfront that the company itself would have to raise its own prices in the near future. Framework also took the opportunity to assure that existing pre-orders will not be affected by this latest price increase. Furthermore, both the company's pre-built laptops and Framework Desktop that come with memory already installed won't see an uptick in price either—at least for the time being. The company calls the pricing situation \"extremely volatile,\" and states it will likely need to \"make further price updates on both DDR5 modules and on our systems that come with memory, whether DDR5, LPDDR5X, or GDDR.\" The company…",

Id Software's omnipresent FPS is playable on every device imaginable, from pianos to printers to even gut bacteria , while Nightdive released a delicious double-barrelled overhaul of Doom + Doom 2 last year, which exists on top of the fact that you can play vanilla Doom in your browser . But it turns out I was wrong, terribly wrong, as an entire subculture of Doom modding has just been excavated in a way that might spell actual doom for my career. DoomScroll is a new website that lets users scroll through and play thousands (and I mean thousands ) of user-made Doom WADs right in your browser. DoomScroll is the creation of software engineer James Baicoianu and Internet archivist Jason Scott, who have developed it over several years and released it to celebrate Doom's 32 nd birthday: \"Our goal was to make decades of work from one of the most creative communities in gaming history more accessible and visible to everyone,\" Baicoianu explained in a Bluesky thread. \"The community has built so much over the years, and there's no question that Doom has had a lasting influence on the game industry as we k…",

Two of them, in fact: A remake of the original called Legacy of Atlantis and an all-new adventure entitled Tomb Raider: Catalyst. But what about the new voice? That will be provided by Alix Wilton Regan, who will portray Lara Croft in both upcoming games \"with fresh spirit and depth, marking a new era in the Tomb Raider franchise,\" Amazon said . Regan is a prolific voice actor whose past roles include Aya in Assassin's Creed: Origins, Alt Cunningham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Inquisitor in Dragon Age, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and Tasi Trianon in Amnesia: Rebirth. She's also appeared in Return to Monkey Island, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, BioMutant, Trine 2, Mass Effect 3, and numerous others—it's quite an impressive CV. You can get a taste of Regan's take on Lara in the new Tomb Raider announcement trailers—she sounds very Lara-like to me: And hey, just in case you haven't seen it, here's Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Regan's voice work can be heard briefly in this one too: Regan will take the place of Camilla Luddington, who handled the role over the previous three games in the series: Tomb Raider (the 2013 one, …",

In a tweet posted a few hours before the ceremony, they shared a screenshot of two image folders on a Windows desktop: \"memes if we win GOTY\" and \"memes if we don't win GOTY.\" The latter turned out to come in clutch, as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was shut out of every category it was nominated for. And it lost every single one of those to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG took home Best RPG, Best Narrative, and Game of the Year, all major categories Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was nominated in. The loss of those first two elicited a 'This is fine' meme post, but Game of the Year followed with the killing blow. Kingdom Come's social account responded to that disappointment with a perfect dialogue option from KCD1. ggwp @expedition33 😉 pic.twitter.com/ZPl55G1CW4 December 12, 2025 They really did have their memes prepared for the moment—I'm now wondering what they would've posted if Hollow Knight: Silksong had nabbed the top prize.
