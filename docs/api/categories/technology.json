If you're a PC gamer, your cup runneth over so much that you may still be catching up on the year's biggest hits even now, and you're not alone. In fact, one industry analysis group reckons Dec. 2025 was Steam's highest-grossing December ever. That estimation comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics , which reported that last month saw over 100 million Steam users generate $1.6 billion dollars in gross revenue. That would make it the platform's best Christmas month in history. The report explains \"that’s up 22.7% over December 2024 and even more than December 2020’s pandemic-driven high of $1.4 billion.\" The report also notes that Arc Raiders is the second-biggest breadwinner of the season⁠—the first is eternally Counter-Strike 2, as dictated by the laws of physics—with a staggering 1.2 million copies sold just in the weeks between Dec. 21 and Jan. 4. As the article puts it, \"the brakes are broken on the ARC Raiders train,\" with the game selling 12 million copies overall. 250,000 copies were apparently sold on Boxing Day alone, with almost 3.2 million players checking in and half of them…",

For dark fantasy RPG Lunacid , however, developer Kira LLC took inspiration from the Japanese studio's far lesser-known series King's Field, which first appeared on the PlayStation 1. Despite taking this leftfield approach, Lunacid proved a big hit, racking up a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam from over 7,000 Steam reviews . Indeed, Lunacid has been successful enough that it's getting some DLC, even though its creator, Kira, is confused about the game's success. In a Steam post , Kira issued an update on the expansion's progress: \"I am still working on the DLC, it's about 70% done (I feel like it's been at 70% forever though). I definitely had too big a scope for it, but I have to complete it, even just for my sake.\" Kira points out that completing the DLC is currently her main project, briefly apologising for \"getting distracted by Halo modding.\" She doesn't provide an estimate for how long that additional 30% will take, but notes that the DLC's launch will coincide with \"a few more rounds of bug fixing that wil…",

Re-Logic wanted update 1.4.5 to be a global launch concurrent across all platforms, which is partly what has held things up. Indeed, Re-Logic had hoped to release update 1.4.5 in December last year.

Under the forensic eye of PC gaming's modding community, however, nothing remains hidden for long.

Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish.

Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo. In other words, Steam's disclosure requirement is not concerned with generative AI tools used behind the scenes for efficiency gains (presumably including coding helpers) or office work, but with things like final art, sound, and writin…",

Hours of my youth were spent fascinated by the fact that there were people out there making Oakeshott Type XVIII longswords and copies of Gandalf's Glamdring. In other words, I was destined from a young age to be the kind of person who'd see that Bladesong, a fantasy swordsmithing simulator, is launching in early access on Steam next week, and immediately add it to PC Gamer's task tracking software with the addendum \"hell yes dude this is videogames.\" (Image credit: Mythwright) Bladesong promises an elaborate and intricate toolset for handcrafting your Platonic ideal of a cool sword—whether that's a period-accurate arming sword or a glowing, rune-etched work of high fantasy maximalism with appropriately absurd proportions.

Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains.

A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person.

Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable.

Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information.

A collaboration between Capcom and luxury watchmaker Hamilton, the watches have been seen on the wrists of dual protagonists Grace and Leon in the trailers (though I can't say I especially noticed it because Leon was chainsawing a zombie doctor in half ). There are two models, only 2,000 will be made, and they will set you back a cool $1,475 for Grace's watch, and $2,175 for Leon's watch. Hamilton's descriptions of the watches are really something, the kind of thing only a very bored person who has nothing to do but sell watches would come up with. \"Grace wears a unique American Classic Pan Europ that blends strength and sophistication with a gold-accented strap, geometric case-back motifs, and a bold gold-and-black dial.\" Bold! As for the main man: \"Leon wears a unique Khaki Field Auto Chrono, a rugged all…",

    "body": "Elden Ring: Nightreign has been collecting some dust in my library recently—not for any particular reason, I got 66 hours out of the dang thing, I'm just a human being with limited time, MMOs to keep up with, and, like, chores to do (I am aware this is quitter talk). I might, however, blow off the dust and give it another whirl, because my favourite boy, the Executor, just got a huge sweep of buffs. Oh, and also, like, Guardians and Revenants and Raiders, but who cares about that—my Sekiro-loving heart just got everything it ever wanted. I'll just be going through the Nightfarers caught up in the patch 1.03.2 buffs one by one, starting with my favourite: The Executor's Cursed Sword skill, the thing that lets you parry, is now a lot stronger.
