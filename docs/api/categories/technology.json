Come back every Saturday to read a new interview, digging into the important questions, like \"how tidy is your desktop?\" and \"what game will you never uninstall?\" Dan Marshall first got into PC gaming at around eight years old when he visited a friend's house. There, he laid eyes on Wolfenstein 3D , a moment that changed his life forever. \"It was just such a generational leap from anything I think I've seen up to that point,\" he says. \"My brain just did not comprehend what it was saying. It was violent and it was 3D and it looked exactly like real life.\" Today, Marshall is the director of Size Five Games, a British indie studio that has developed games like the point 'n' click throwback Time Gentlemen, Please! the procedurally generated heist sim The Swindle , and the hybrid platformer and adventure game Lair of the Clockwork God . Size Five's latest game is Earth Must Die , a stylish comedy adventure in which you play an alien dictator hellbent on destroying Earth. \"I think comedy is better when there's a serious heart to it. And the serious heart to this was like 'fuck …",

House House's avian bullying simulator was a riotous success when it released in 2020, the kind of phenomenon that normally spawns a legion of imitators. Yet with the possible exception of Little Kitty, Big City , beast-based shenanigans have been surprisingly scarce. No Untitled Moose Game, no games about foxes or other geographically appropriate creatures wreaking havoc in English villages. And certainly, no more games about geese. That is, until now. At the end of last year, a new goose game hatched on Steam, and it's so unsettling that it's made me regret ever wishing for more waterfowl-based entertainment. (Image credit: SweatyChair) Tingus Goose is very different from Untitled Goose Game. It's an idle clicker rather than a 3D physics puzzler, and the relationship it depicts between humans and geese is far less antagonistic than in House House's game. But it does share one crucial thematic link, namely geese doing upsetting things. It's the creation of internet artist and animator MasterTingus, who specialise…",

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

Nitrogen's ESXi ransomware, as spotted by Coveware (via The Register ), has a \"coding mistake in the ESXi malware [that] causes it to encrypt all the files with the wrong public key, irrevocably corrupting them.\" Effectively, once ransomware gets into your device (often via suspicious links or PC vulnerabilities), it then encrypts your valuable files and stores a randomly generated key that only it knows. That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back. Coveware points out that when the public key is accessed, the ransomware mistakenly overwrites the first four bytes of the key, which means \"no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"…",

I know that for many gamers, it delivered the hyperfast bullet ballet they'd always wanted, but for me, it simply felt that far too much of Doom's DNA had been sacrificed in order to deliver it. Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed. A more grounded (literally) take on the classic FPS formula that, to me at least, felt far more like a spiritual successor to the legendary 1993 original. And now, thanks to id Software's 35th anniversary celebrations, Doom: The Dark Ages is over two-thirds off. I definitely rate this FPS, to the point that I'd personally recommend picking it up over Eternal, so I thought I would bring the discount to the wider PC g…",

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules. As the memory supply crisis went further and further into the red, it became clear that a VRAM-stuffed Super refresh in the coming months was unlikely. The RTX 50-series cards we've tested to da…",

And if it can, can HBO and Mazin be trusted to do it justice? Well, depends who you ask. For instance, if you ask Larian CEO Swen Vincke, the future seems pretty bright, all things considered. In a post on X , Vincke said that \"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures,\" so a series that builds on them makes perfect sense. Even more promising, despite Larian having no official involvement with the series, Mazin and co are apparently in touch with the studio: \"Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us,\" wrote Vincke. \"From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope.\" Hooray!

Spoilers ahead for Fallout season 2 At the end of the first season, the levels for each of our main characters were slightly skewed, or at least not where you'd expect them to be. Despite being the main character, Lucy only managed to get to level 8, while The Ghoul sat somewhere around level 89, and Maximus managed to reach level 9. Thaddeus also somehow managed to reach level 50 after accidentally turning himself into a Ghoul (more on that later).

Deadline also reports that the writer and producer has been playing D&D weekly for the past 15 years. Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3. The original BioWare RPGs are \"not official source material,\" the site says, but the show can use material from D&D's Forgotten Realms setting in general.
