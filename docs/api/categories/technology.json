The redesigned layout features a wavy progress bar and moves the play, pause, and track controls to the left. The uniform template will ensure a consistent experience across different media apps like Spotify and YouTube Music on the Android Auto platform. Google introduced the new Media Playback template for Android Auto last year, giving music player apps like Spotify and YouTube Music a consistent look and experience. More recently, the company updated the template with a new wavy progress bar , adding some visual flair. However, most users have not been able to enjoy the changes so far, as the changes have been under testing all this time. Thankfully, that is now changing, as the new Media Playback template is now rolling out to users in the stable branch. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But while the transition has been largely straightforward and seamless on Android devices, the search giant is still actively working on the transition plan for its smart home device family. Late last year, the company announced that it would finally begin testing Gemini for Home across its existing hardware line before releasing a new smart speaker later in 2026. After gaining access to the Gemini for Home preview program a few weeks ago, I’ve been using it as my primary voice assistant across several Google Home speakers to see how well it stacks up against its predecessor.

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

The company hasn’t revealed specifics about the design or its utility, but commented on the likelihood of multiple devices. Besides unveiling the ChatGPT-powered device, OpenAI might also start selling it in 2026. It’s no secret that OpenAI is building an AI device that will somehow integrate ChatGPT to help you with responses in the physical world. It has been on the cards since 2024, when OpenAI joined hands with Apple’s former design lead Jony Ive , and then followed by acquiring Ive’s startup in 2025. While the exact nature of the device remains unknown, various hypotheses have emerged. For instance, a leaker last year suggested it could be an audio device shaped like a pen , while a more recent leak indicated it would be a pair of earphones with a previously unseen design . Although the details remain hazy, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane offered some visibility on the timeline. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum at the Axios House forum in Davos, Switzerland, Lehane said OpenAI’s device is “on track” to be unveiled in the second half …",

It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually, Google backed down and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Update: January 18, 2026 (11:18 PM ET): After publication, we heard from Marc Prud’hommeaux, the founder of the App Fair Project and an F-Droid board member, who pointed out that the warning strings we referenced are not entirely new to Android. Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development. The move from system-level code to Google Play could signal that the company is actively preparing to surface this flow to users. Still, Google has yet to clearly explain how its promised “advanced” sideloading path will work in practice. Until the c…",

Big points if you remember that the HUAWEI Mate 10’s Kirin 970 processor was the first, though similar ideas had been floating around, particularly in imaging, before then. Of course, a lot has changed in the last eight years — Apple has finally embraced AI, albeit with mixed results, and Google has obviously leaned heavily into its Tensor Processor Unit for everything from imaging to on-device language translation. Ask any of the big tech companies, from Arm and Qualcomm to Apple and Samsung, and they’ll all tell you that AI is the future of smartphone hardware and software.",
