Microsoft had to make a carveout in its Bluetooth driver code for a specific mouse—its own Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000, released in 2006—because someone stuck a ® symbol in the name and caused the driver code to break. After I wrote that story, PC Gamer reader Bill (not Gates) emailed me with his own favorite bit of Windows lore and easily one-upped Microsoft mucking up its Bluetooth code. \"Windows XP and Win 7 'sounds' were edited and processed using a CRACKED version of Sonic Foundry Sound Forge ver. 4.5. You cannot make this up,\" he wrote. Well, maybe you could , but Bill didn't. This story actually goes back to 2004, when it was reported by German publication PC Welt.

That's excellent news for the folks who spent 1999 through 2005 jumping between numbered Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Fatal Frame games, long before all three series took breaks with spin-offs or went quiet. 2012 marks the last time Japan's horror trio released something more significant than a remaster within the same six months—the year Resident Evil 6, Silent Hill: Downpour, and the Wii-exclusive Fatal Frame 2 remake launched. Fatal Frame saw a couple of remasters in recent years, but those weren't quite as extensive as what Koei shared today. And yes, you read that correctly. This is the second remake of the second Fatal Frame, though folks in North America never had the chance to play the 2012 one.

In a follow-up post , Sweeney doubled down: \"This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines.\" I'm not sure that's accurate—my perception is that the divide isn't along political lines so much as it is between billionaires (like Sweeney) who tend to view generative AI as a way to crank out more content with less expense , …",

    "body": "You've probably already heard, what with all the glowing coverage and the 700,000 concurrent players it racked up last weekend, but Arc Raiders is a hit. And not just a hit: Nexon, the parent company of Arc Raiders developer Embark Studios, says it's the most successful launch in the company's history. Confirmation of Arc's big hitness comes from Nexon's Q3 2025 earnings report , in which Nexon president and CEO Junghun Lee said the game \"is the most successful global launch in Nexon's history—an extraordinary achievement for an all-new IP.\" \"Backed by a pipeline of fresh content that extends through 2026, we believe Arc Raiders could become an enduring contributor to Nexon's portfolio of blockbuster global franchises,\" Lee added. The raves continued in a separate earnings letter , which came complete with the Arc Raiders logo plastered across the top, in case anyone missed the point. (Image credit: Nexon) \"Nexon's Embark Studios executed a powerful launch, sustaining the #1 ranking on Steam's Global Top Sellers list,\" the letter states. \"To date, the game has sold 4 million copies and reached more than 700,000 concurrent players across all platforms.

It turns out that, despite competition from Blueant, Razer, OXS, and Majority, Creative is on a bit of a hot streak of late.

For $70, this is a super capable set of speakers that have solid sound reproduction and come in a tiny little shell. If you have limited space, the Pro is a great choice, though the bass is a little lacking, and the Bluetooth is a pretty basic as it only supports the SBC codec. No lossless for you (at least wirelessly). If you aren't in the market for a budget set of speakers, the Creative Stage Pro has been named the best gaming soundbar , and for good reason.

Yet Phison's CEO Khein-Seng Pua says that in \"only three months\", NAND prices have doubled (via Digitimes ). What gives? Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, that's the cost of NAND, not the cost of an SSD. Phison buys NAND (flash) chips from suppliers—the three big ones being Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—and then uses them to make their own enterprise SSDs or to make SSDs for other customers. So, if the TLC flash that Phison is buying has risen from about $4.80 for one Tb (128 GB) in July to $10.70, as Pua claims, NAND has doubled in price, but this has yet to ripple into the SSD market. It will, though; that's unavoidable. SSD makers like Phison aren't going to shoulder 2x costs just 'cause. Eventually, SSD prices will have to rise. The primary cause for the rise in NAND prices is almost certainly undersupply caused by high demand for AI servers , which has now knocked on to SSD manufacturers like Phison. The …",

I realise that some will have noticed this immediately, and I'm probably a dummy for playing so long without noticing, but you're so rarely up-close with these things that it had just never occurred to me until a buddy did it by mistake with, I think, a wasp. THIS WAS ACCIDENTAL, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT from r/ArcRaiders It really is a neat option, with your raider capable of mantling onto the side of the smaller flying…",

If you've been paying attention to your mission prompts, you might actually remember going to Victory Ridge for the Straight Record quest, where you disarm an EMP device. Once you head to the right place, it's very similar to A Reveal in Ruins , i.e. a simple two step quest involving you finding a thing and bringing said thing back to the quest giver. If you want to make sure you get the item back in one piece, consider bringing a loadout with a safe pocket so you can immediately stow it in there. Otherwise, here's where to find Victory Ridge and how to complete the quest. How to complete Echoes of Victory Ridge in Arc Raiders Look for a broken section of highway just to the south of the first 'B' in West Broken Bridge (Image credit: Embark Studios) As mentioned, this quest is pretty straightforward. First off, you have to head to \"Victory Ridge\" otherwise known as West Broken Bridge in the north of Dam Battlegrounds . You'll have to go to the location above, pretty much exactly where the West Broken Bridge text appears on the map. When you get there, your obj…",

I used it for quite some time, until the Google ecosystem became too all-encompassing to ignore. But over recent years, it seemed the yellow-tailed browser was becoming less privacy-focused after all, leaving it just like the other mainstream options. So it's good news, and perhaps vindication for those who were still holding out hope for Firefox, that it's expanding its fingerprint protections . By this, it means it's expanding its protections against websites linking you to a \"secret digital ID\" by \"collecting subtle details of your setup—ranging from your time zone to your operating system settings—that together create a 'fingerprint' identifiable across websites and across browser sessions.\" Fingerprinting is pretty much standard practice for many sites today. You should never assume that just because you don't have an official account on a website, it doesn't identify you between visits and so on, sometimes even regardless of stored cookies. From eyeballing the chart Mozilla presents, without any protections, over 60% of users appear unique to sites that fingerprint, and the…",

Exoskeleton maker Dnsys is the partner in this enterprise and worked with Kojima Productions art director Yoji Shinkawa on the design. The exoskeleton is based on an existing Dnsys model but altered to fit the Death Stranding aesthetic, with things like lights that show the battery level dotted on the frame. \"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,\" says Shinkawa . \"Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear. Wearing it feels as if the world of Death Stranding has come to life, where imagination and reality finally connect.\" Then we get to the claims of what this thing does.

So much that it's often overwhelming and confusing, leading you to lug back a rucksack full of junk, hoping that at least something in it will come in handy. Simply put, I got fed up and decided to get to the root of the issue; I jotted down all 62 unique items I needed to find for quests, Scrappy and workshop upgrades, and the Expedition Project , which adds up to a staggering 1,195 materials you need to haul back to Speranza. Here's hoping my math skills haven't let me down. Nevertheless, in tallying this all up, I noticed a few interesting things. Firstly, you need to loot the drivers of every single Arc robot in the game right now besides a Queen. As you'd imagine, you generally need more of the basic Arcs' parts compared to the tougher ones, though you need six Bastion and Bombardier Cells, six Surveyor Vaults, and eight Leaper Pulse Units. I think it's safe to say we all hate fighting Leapers , and Surveyor drones are so skittish that they're hard to actually put down.

Patent Result values a company's quality over quantity and the strength of the ideas being brought to the table, so the ranking is based on both \"the quantity and relevance of their patents\". How do you measure that? Well, you take into account \"the frequency of a given patent being cited as a basis for the rejection of another company's patent\"—if one company's patent carries more weight, similar ideas are more likely to be rejected. While Bandai Namco was in the top three last year, it has moved up past mobile game developer Gree and taken SIE's crown, leading the way with 245 patents and a score of 8,565.2—which is a significant lead. Here are the patent scores for the top three: Bandai: 8,565.2 Sony Interactive Entertainment: 6,631.0 Gree: 5,121.9 The list is dominated by several familiar giants of the industry, such as Sega, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company.
