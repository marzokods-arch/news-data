At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi). After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.

And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well. A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn't exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago . When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games. Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS's footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the origin…",

Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is. The Nuclear Regulation Authority was reportedly alerted by a whistleblower in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data. Based on an English translation , it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled …",

While that might sound rather meager, it's a 40 percent increase from 2025's survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV . Plain old internal combustion remains Americans' first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that's how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).

    "summary": "Rather than being used as a storage material, the sulfur gives up electrons.",
    "body": "Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That's mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market. But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur's complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials. Sulfur chemistry Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that's not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin …",

They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history. From predators’ quarry to rock quarry Archaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there. Read full article Comments",

Now that it has a few iterations of modern flip phones under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Google's Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside. Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it's far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won't confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time. What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables. Read full article Comments",

In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the Raspberry Pi 400 , which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. It was followed by the Raspberry Pi 500, with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside; and the Pi 500+ , which has an NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).

CEO Jensen Huang's characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company's dominant AI business, relegating the company's gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening . Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia's basket of upscaling and frame-generation technologies. DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new \"second-generation transformer model\" that Nvidia says has been \"trained on an expanded data set\" to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia's Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it's working from a lower-resolution source image.

Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample.

    "body": "It's been almost exactly two years since Nvidia announced G-Sync Pulsar , its new backlight strobing technology designed to limit display motion blur caused by old images persisting on the viewer's retina. At the time, Nvidia said that technology would debut on Asus' ROG Swift PG27 Series monitors by the end of 2024.
