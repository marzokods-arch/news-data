    "body": "Four years is a lifetime when it comes to artificial intelligence. Since the first edition of this study was published in 2021, AI’s capabilities have been advancing at speed, and the advances have not slowed since generative AI’s breakthrough. For example, multimodality— the ability to process information not only as text but also as audio, video, and other unstructured formats—is becoming a common feature of AI models. AI’s capacity to reason and act autonomously has also grown, and organizations are now starting to work with AI agents that can do just that. Amid all the change, there remains a constant: the quality of an AI model’s outputs is only ever as good as the data that feeds it. Data management technologies and practices have also been advancing, but the second edition of this study suggests that most organizations are not leveraging those fast enough to keep up with AI’s development. As a result of that and other hindrances, relatively few organizations are delivering the desired business results from their AI strategy. No more than 2% of senior executives we surveyed rate their organizations highly in terms of delivering results from AI. DOWNLOAD THE REPORT To determi…",

DeepSeek may have found a new way to improve AI’s ability to remember The news: An AI model released by Chinese AI company DeepSeek uses new techniques that could significantly improve AI’s ability to “remember.” How it works: The optical character recognition model works by extracting text from an image and turning it into machine-readable words. This is the same technology that powers scanner apps, translation of text in photos, and many accessibility tools. Why it matters: Researchers say the model’s main innovation lies in how it processes information—specifically, how it stores and retrieves data. Improving how AI models “remember” could reduce how much computing power they need to run, thus mitigating AI’s large (and growing) carbon footprint.

And maybe they never will. This month’s news doesn’t exactly cast the technology in a glowing light either. A bunch of NGOs and aid agencies are using AI models to generate images of fake suffering people to guilt their Instagram followers.

    "body": "An AI model released by the Chinese AI company DeepSeek uses new techniques that could significantly improve AI’s ability to “remember.” Released last week, the optical character recognition (OCR) model works by extracting text from an image and turning it into machine-readable words. This is the same technology that powers scanner apps, translation of text in photos, and many accessibility tools.&nbsp; OCR is already a mature field with numerous high-performing systems, and according to the paper and some early reviews, DeepSeek’s new model performs on par with top models on key benchmarks. But researchers say the model’s main innovation lies in how it processes information—specifically, how it stores and retrieves memories. Improving how AI models “remember” information could reduce the computing power they need to run, thus mitigating AI’s large (and growing) carbon footprint. Currently, most large language models break text down into thousands of tiny units called tokens. This turns the text into representations that models can understand. However, these tokens quickly become expensive to store and compute with as conversations with end users grow longer. When a user chats wit…",

McKinsey earlier published a similar trend indicating that agentic AI would be the way forward to achieve huge operational benefits for enterprises. At The Wall Street Journal ’s Technology Council Summit , AI technology leaders recommended CIOs stop worrying about AI’s return on investment because measuring gains is difficult and if they were to try, the measurements would be wrong.&nbsp; This places technology leaders in a precarious position–robust tech stacks already sustain their business operations, so what is the upside to introducing new technology?&nbsp; For decades, deployment strategies have followed a consistent cadence where tech operators avoid destabilizing business-critical workflows to swap out individual components in tech stacks.

On the one hand, he thinks that the industry is taking AI in a dangerous direction by building chatbots that present as human: He worries that people will be tricked into seeing life instead of lifelike behavior. In August, he published a much-discussed post on his personal blog that urged his peers to stop trying to make what he called “ seemingly conscious artificial intelligence ,” or SCAI. On the other hand, Suleyman runs a product shop that must compete with those peers. Last week, Microsoft announced a string of updates to its Copilot chatbot , designed to boost its appeal in a crowded market in which customers can pick and choose between a pantheon of rival bots that already includes ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and more. I talked to Suleyman about the tension at play when it comes to designing our interactions with chatbots and his ultimate vision for what this new technology should be. One key Copilot update is a group-chat feature that lets multiple people talk to the chatbot at the same time.

First there was the underwhelming release of GPT-5 in August. Then a report released two weeks later found that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing, which caused a brief stock market panic. I wanted to know: Which companies are spooked enough to scale back their AI spending? I searched and searched for them. As I did, more news fueled the idea of an AI bubble that, if popped, would spell doom economy-wide. Stories spread about the circular nature of AI spending, layoffs , the inability of companies to articulate what exactly AI will do for them. Even the smartest people building modern AI systems were saying the tech has not progressed as much as its evangelists promised.&nbsp; But after all my searching, companies that took these developments as a sign to perhaps not go all in on AI were nowhere to be found.
