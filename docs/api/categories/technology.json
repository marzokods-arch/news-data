Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns.

It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year.

    "body": "Arc Raiders has a lot of odd quirks, like various skills not functioning how you'd think , being able to effectively front-flip to avoid fall damage, or even the ability to ride its terrifying machines. Honestly, I thought I'd seen it all at this point. And then I saw a player frozen in time. Completely paralysed mid-motion. Naturally, I just assumed the player had died, and the game had bugged to make their death pose look a little funky. It turns out that I was almost bang on the money. Now illuminated having watched Jinko's latest Arc Raiders mythbusting video, I've learned that these players stuck in place are the result of forcing the game closed, such as the ol' ALT+F4 or disconnecting—not from being killed or even surrendering to return to the main menu. Because you've been forced out of the match, you're able to rejoin and pick right up where you left off if you haven't been killed in your absence. As you'll see in the timestamped video above, this peculiarity can lead to some very amusing events. Jinko tests this quirk with a friend on a zipline, and the player comes to a complete stop midway through, only to go zooming off as if nothing happened when they join back. Best…",

    "body": "As AI continues to balloon and pull in even more investment, one of the fiercest debates (other than copyright , ethics , and the environment ) is about whether or not it's a bubble. AMD's Lisa Su has weighed in on the debate. Recently, in an interview with Wired , the AMD chief was asked if she thought AI was a bubble. Her response: “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” Su claims that fears around a potential bubble are \"somewhat overstated\". Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment. Investment is certainly there when it comes to AI. Nvidia is the first company to have been valued at $5 trillion . Nvidia, in turn, invested $100 billion into OpenAI back in S…",

    "body": "If you've got good taste (read: the exact same taste as me), Tim Cain bears a lot of responsibility for some of your favourite games ever. His name is on the original Fallouts, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, and plenty else besides. Alas, he's been in a state of kind-of-retirement in recent years, doing bits and pieces of contract work for Obsidian, his former employer, and others, but generally contenting himself with his YouTube channel, where he chats about game design, career anecdotes, and how he's in \" semi-retirement \" now. Well, no longer. In his most recent video, Cain announced that he's moved back to California, gone back to full-time work at Obsidian (as an in-office, not remote, worker), gained several new t-shirts and a Moon Man tattoo, and befriended a squirrel in the time since he last updated us on his job situation. Which is quite a lot. I get tired if I have to go to the post office and go to work on the same day. \"I'm back at Obsidian,\" an energetic Cain told viewers. \"I'm their full-time employee, and in-person, not remote. So I'm not a contractor anymore.\" What's he working on? Well, wouldn't you like to know?…",
