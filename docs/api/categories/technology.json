Whether I get extraction camped or betrayed by some randomer who lied about being friendly, death is never too far away in Arc Raiders, especially when people have Trigger Nades. These little detonated grenades have become something of a menace in Arc Raiders as they are powerful enough to take out a raider in a couple of hits and can be activated from afar, killing unsuspecting players. (Image credit: Jinko on YouTube) My first encounter with one was at the Swamp Extraction at Dam Battlegrounds. I had innocently wandered up to the extract to call it, only to be met with a flash of light and sudden death as some rat had placed a couple of Trigger Nades on the call button and scuttled away into the bushes to wait for their victim. Needless to say, these weapons are way too lethal against other raiders, and have for some time now created quite the headache in lobbies. But this may all be behind us now.

Putting aside the fact that killing off the XPS brand never seemed like a good idea, Dell's new laptops certainly look like a promising return for the XPS line. Initially, Dell is launching the XPS 14 and XPS 16, with a 13-inch model to follow. Key attributes for the XPS 14 and 16 models include extremely high quality build quality, the \"best battery life in the industry\" and optional tandem OLED displays. Chassis-wise, the laptops have an all-new design that has some similarities with previous XPS laptops, but does away with the capacitive function keys that proved so controversial, returning that top row of buttons to the keyboard proper. Dell has also added subtle etching on the otherwise seamless glass trackpad panel below the keyboard, again addressing a design issue with the previous XPS design, which left users guessing exactly w…",

Before the expected AI NPU TOPS figures, Intel's VP of PC products, Dan Rogers, dedicated a fair chunk of the company's CES 2026 presentation to the gaming chops of the 18A-based silicon. Ah, it's nice to have a win over the endless AI guff, isn't it? Anyway, headline news is that Intel is claiming up to a 77% integrated graphics performance boost over the previous Lunar Lake-based Intel Core Ultra 9 288V with the top end chips. That's a pretty bold statement, given how impressed we were with Lunar Lake's gaming performance overall. (Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood. Next to some newly-redesigned P and E-cores lies what Intel calls a \"massive GPU\" for the high end Core Ultra X7 and X9 chips, complete with built-in ray tracing support. The iGPU in qu…",

    "body": "At this year's CES event, AMD hasn't really introduced anything completely new in its consumer CPU portfolio. They've either rebadged old chips or just expanded current ranges with a few more models. However, the Ryzen AI Max series of APUs has picked up two extra processors, and one of them could well be the best chip to fit into any top-tier handheld gaming PC. As a quick refresher, Ryzen AI Max processors (aka Strix Halo ) comprise one or two core chiplets (CCDs) plus a huge input/output chiplet (IOD) that houses a pretty beefy GPU. It has 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (2560 shaders), with 64 MB of Level 3 cache, and a unified memory bus that's 256-bits wide. (Image credit: AMD) Up until now, the only entry in the series that sported the full 40 CUs was the very expensive Ryzen AI Max+ 395 . That all changes with the two new chips: the Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The former has two CCDs for 12 cores, 24 threads in total, whereas the latter uses a single CCD sporting 8 cores, 16 threads. The current Ryzen AI Max 385 is also a single CCD chip, but its GPU only houses 32 CUs. With the Max+ 388, you're getting the best Strix Halo processor for gaming: 8 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores/CUs.

    "body": "HyperX, the gaming hardware brand acquired by HP back in 2021, now makes gaming monitors. Well, that's not strictly true. HP makes the monitors, but the newly-announced HyperX Omen OLED 34 looks to be the start of some very tempting offerings, if its impressive specs sheet is anything to go by. It's a 360 Hz 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide, for a start. That puts it in the upper echelons of gaming monitor desirability right from the off, as QD-OLED panels feature in some of our favourite displays . It's got a 0.03 ms response time, as you'd expect from an OLED display, which, combined with the super-speedy refresh rate, should make it a pretty lust-worthy monitor for anyone with a fast-paced multiplayer game obsession. High up on the spec sheet is what's referred to as \"next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology\", which HP says provides much improvement to the picture quality with less text fringing. V-stripe refers to a particular type of sub-pixel layout that puts the green sub-pixel above the red and the blue, creating an inverted \"V\". Early iterations of the tech were prone to blurry text rendering, but the new version is said to sharpen things up considerably—although it's n…",

Corsair was established in 1994, and made about $1.4 billion last year—which I bring up because today Microsoft, a slightly bigger company, has slipped on its own rebranding banana peel. The company is seemingly all but ditching the Office name—which it introduced four years before Corsair existed, and which drove more than $30 billion in revenue just last quarter —with a catchy new name: \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\" Copilot is, notably, a thing that already exists! But as part of the ongoing effort to juice AI assistant usage numbers by making it impossible to not use AI, Microsoft has decided to just call its whole productivity software suite Copilot, I guess.

Talking to Edge magazine for issue 419 , Sandfall Interactive's chief operating officer and production director, François Meurisse, explained the angst and thought process behind stepping into the next game (via GamesRadar ). (Image credit: Kepler Interactive) \"There is a bit of pressure\" from fans and critics when it comes to the team's next game, but \"it's not so important to us,\" Meurisse explains. \"We have time to get really focused on the next game. We have some great ideas we're so excited to explore, and we don't start from the same point. The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff.\" That's a rather humble reflection.

For the unfamiliar, Troika is a very 'realheads know' sort of studio: Its games presaged the similarly buggy (and occasionally unfinished) early work by Obsidian, which was also founded by ex-Interplay devs. But, also like Obsidian, Troika's games were ambitious, imaginative, and unforgettable.
