The reception is much less warm on Steam , though, where fewer than half of the current user reviews are positive. Complaints about Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted are many and varied. Three leap out as particularly common—the lack of dynamic music (which the original game had), no online multiplayer, and allegations (unsubstantiated, as far as I know) of AI-generated or upscaled art assets—and as usual, words like \"lazy\" and \"cash grab\" abound. More generally (and thoughtfully), though, there's just a broad sense of dissatisfaction with the remaster's attention to detail. The reaction reflects the risk of remastering a much-loved game like Plants vs. Zombies—and, for those who weren't hip to the scene 16 years ago, PvZ is much loved.
