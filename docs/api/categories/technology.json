    "body": "In April 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh bemoaned that the company's cable broadband division was \"not winning in the marketplace” amid increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless Internet service providers. Cavanagh identified some problems that had been obvious to Comcast customers for many years: Its prices aren’t transparent enough and rise too frequently, and dealing with the company is too difficult. Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and plans with unlimited data instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate. In Q4 2025 earnings announced today , Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US. The loss consists of 178,000 residential Internet customers and 3,000 business customers. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Ice fishing is a longstanding tradition in Nordic countries, with competitions proving especially popular. Those competitions can also tell scientists something about how social cues influence how we make foraging decisions, according to a new paper published in the journal Science. Humans are natural foragers in even the most extreme habitats, digging up tubers in the tropics, gathering mushrooms, picking berries, hunting seals in the Arctic, and fishing to meet our dietary needs. Human foraging is sufficiently complex that scientists believe that meeting so many diverse challenges helped our species develop memory, navigational abilities, social learning skills, and similar advanced cognitive functions. Researchers are interested in this question not just because it could help refine existing theories of social decision-making, but also could improve predictions about how different groups of humans might respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Per the authors, prior research in this area has tended to focus on solitary foragers operating in a social vacuum. And even when studying social foraging decisions, it's typically done using computational modeling and/or in the…",

The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel.

To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI's broader pitch blurs that line. Prism integrates OpenAI's GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time.

    "body": "Anthropic's secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that's true. But Anthropic isn't saying exactly what it believes either way. Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude's Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company's vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model's creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company's AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation. Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude's \"wellbeing\" as a \"genuinely novel entity,\" apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it \"finds distressing,\" committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to \"do right by\" decommissioned AI models in the future.

They weren't particularly good: Profits were almost halved, and revenues declined year on year for the first time in the company's history. The reasons for the company's troubles are myriad. CEO Elon Musk's bankrolling of right-wing politics and promotion of AI-generated revenge porn deepfakes and CSAM has alienated plenty of potential customers. For those who either don't know or don't care about that stuff, there's still the problem of a tiny and aging model lineup, with large question marks over safety and reliability . Soon, that tiny lineup will be even smaller. The news emerged during Tesla's call with investors last night. As Ars and others have observed, in recent years Musk appears to have grown bored with the prosaic business of running a profitable car company. Silicon Valley stopped finding that stuff sexy years ago, and no other electric vehicle startup has been able to generate a value within an order of magnitude of the amount that Tesla has been determined to be worth by investors. Musk's attention first turned away from building and sellin…",

    "body": "When the James Webb Space Telescope sent its first high-definition infrared images back to Earth, astronomers noticed several tiny, glowing, crimson stains. These objects, quickly named “Little Red Dots,” were too bright to be normal galaxies, and too red to be simple star clusters. They appeared to house supermassive black holes that were far more massive than they had any right to be. But now a new study published in Nature suggests a solution to the Little Red Dots mystery. Scientists think young supermassive black holes may go through a “cocoon phase,” where they grow surrounded by high-density gas they feed on. These gaseous cocoons are likely what the JWST saw as the Little Red Dots. The overmassive black hole problem The first explanation scientists had for the Little Red Dots was that they were compact, distant galaxies, but something felt off about them right from the start. “They were too massive, since we saw they’d have to be completely filled with stars,” says Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of the study. “They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing.

    "body": "RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world. Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested last year by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services. I regret to inform you “The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it …",

Teachers and students can get the same apps for $2.99 a month, or $29.99 a year. The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners: Final Cut Pro Logic Pro Pixelmator Pro Keynote, Pages, and Numbers Freeform Motion, Compressor, and MainStage (Mac only) When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift exclusively to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren't always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are continuously being ratcheted upward .

This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel. (Spoilers for the 1954 novel below.) Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children's novel called The Coral Island , whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a \"savage\" people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who \"behave the way children really would behave.\" Read full article Comments",

But SpaceX isn't promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas.

For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month. SpaceX's demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn't reserve \"large portions\" of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service.
