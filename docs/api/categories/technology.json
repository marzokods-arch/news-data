It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws.
