Now a new report claims it's set to be released by the end of March. According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry. To pass that opportunity up only to launch a month or two later? That's a bit odd. Of course, the tech industry is currently in flux thanks to the ongoing RAMpocolypse . So that could be a factor.

Then you need to go back to your ordinary life. The creator of Painkiller and current creative director of Witchfire , Adrian Chmielarz, sounds a little like a Cthulhu-stricken Lovecraft protagonist in his recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz . The cosmic entity in question? Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which has confounded executive suits and game developers alike by raking in enormous success despite being built by a core team of 30 people (and a large list of contractors) . At the very least, Chmielarz is talking from a place of comparison with Witchfire's similarly-sized team of just under 30 devs—he's cognisant of the above quibble, stating later in the interview \"we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing\". And he boggles not at the size, but at the relative amount of novices on Sandfall's roster. \"We only wanted to work with the best,\" Chmielarz explains, \"B…",

Transfers require a token, which every player has been given, and that token will replenish a week after using it. In other words, you'll get one server transfer per week. Players have been clambering for server transfers for a while now: for some it's because the world they started playing on no longer has enough players and feels like a ghost town, or because one particular faction is dominating the Landsraad, or because their friends have moved onto other games and they're looking for some new blood.

Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display.

    "body": "Back in the 1990s, my fellow PC chums and I thought we had stumbled across a magic trick with Windows 95, something that we thought nobody else knew about: holding the shift key when you hit restart just fired up the operating system again, not the whole PC. Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

    "body": "These days, the only time I recapture the sheer rush of Steam sales of olde (\"I can buy every Quake game for £5? I'd be a fool not to!\") is when I find one of those 'complete your collection' sets some games have. You know the ones: they combine a bunch of games in a series, subtract the prices of the ones you already own, then slap a little discount on the remainder to tempt you into splashing out to complete the set. When you find one of those in the midst of an already-ongoing sale, making it all even cheaper? Baby, that's the good stuff. Well, joyous news: you can now share that glee with your Steam pals. As spotted by SteamDB , Valve has recently pushed a change through that means you can now purchase these kinds of bundles as gifts. The discounting feature works as it should: if you buy a bundle for someone who already has some of the games featured in it, it'll cost you less overall. I've tested this myself with some Steam friends and this Ghost Recon bundle—for those who don't have any of the games, it would cost me £43 to gift it. For those who already have some of them, it's cheaper. Image 1 of 3 Buying the bundle for me. (Image credit: Valve) Image 2 of 3 Buying the bun…",

    "body": "With the big screen adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant set to arrive in theaters next month, the first trailer is here to remind us all that sometimes works sucks, but all you can do is power through to the end of your shift and hope tomorrow is better. The Mortuary Assistant was something of a surprise hit in 2022: A game that puts players in the shoes of a fresh-out-of-college apprentice mortician who's called into work late one night to handle some unexpected embalmings. But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.
