Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set. Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Logitech) The wheelbase itself will be available as a standalone unit starting at $350/€300, and comes with full TrueForce support, which uses game data in combination with audio to approximate some of the details that other direct drive wheels can miss, like engine rumble and precise kerb simula…",

Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card? Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation. This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile. If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter. In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, t…",

The Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike lets you adjust the mouse click's actuation point or enable rapid trigger, just like you can on a Hall effect or optical keyboard. The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\" In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the best gaming keyboards , but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel. One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you want that click at the point of actuation. This is what Logitech is claiming to have solved thanks to its \"Superstrike\" technology which is a \"combination of inductive analogue sensing and real-t…",

It's the sort of laptop you'd imagine featuring in an action movie from that period, the kind of machine that someone wearing wraparound sunglasses would throw from one moving car to another, wherein the token tech nerd would catch it, mash the keys for a few seconds, then loudly declare \"I'm in.\" Anyway, I digress. The real stars of the show here are those three rotary encoder dials on the right-hand side of the keyboard.

Anticipate loot and an inventory, and combat that hews closer to a (much easier) soulslike than the choreographed combat of yore. Which I gotta admit, I'm a little sad about.

Yup, that's right, that includes Nvidia GPUs. Chris Hall, Senior Director Software Development and head of AMD's ROCm project, which is a software stack for AI development and roughly equivalent to Nvidia's CUDA platform, explained that FSR Redstone—which could be called FSR 5 when it hopefully releases later this year—was developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code). Apparently, FSR Redstone's neural rendering technology is \"converted\" into compute Shader code. \"This means that FSR Redstone's neural rendering core can also run on GPUs made by other companies,\" Hall said (via machine translation). In other words, it doesn't require AI or matrix math cores, just as Nvidia's DLSS technology requires Tensor cores. It can run on conventional GPU shaders. \"ML2CODE-based frameworks, such as FSR Redstone, can be seamlessly integrated directly into DirectX or Vulkan graphics pipelines with minimal latency.
