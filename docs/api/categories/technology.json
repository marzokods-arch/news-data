The theories grew even stronger with the recent trend of Xbox games coming to PlayStation 5 and the Windows Central report that Microsoft's next console will let you launch Windows at any time, sort of like Linux on the Steam Deck. Rumors of WoW coming to consoles have happened before, but they've never really lined up this well with what's happening elsewhere in the industry. According to WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas on a recent episode of the Unshackled Fury podcast (at 21:40), you can stop speculating: The MMO isn't on its way to consoles. \"To be fully transparent, there's no reason for us to hide anything about this,\" he said. \"If we were actively working towards bringing WoW to consoles, or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying, 'We're actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it's a place where we want to land.'\" \"Our focus remains, right no…",

Considering I'm level 20 and already prepping an expedition to send off my Raider to a nice farm upstate, you can take my word for it that this place is extremely lucrative. And the best part? It's on the outskirts of the Buried City rather than the highly contested centre of the town, it's close to a Raider Hatch and a subway station for fast exfil, and it doesn't require a key, or fighting past a load of Arc enemies to access it. A little oasis in the apocalypse. Weirdly, all you have to do is breach a single door and step into a small room with four lootable containers. The loot spot is behind a breachable door on the north side of the platform at Marano Station (Image credit: Embark Studios) So where is this golden loot spot: Marano Station . You'll have to head here for the Market Correction quest, but otherwise, it's a pretty uninhabited area of the map, a little ways off to the side of the Marano Park in the north where the Bastion likes…",

It's so popular, in fact, that its servers had a brief wobble over the weekend as more than 350,000 people tried to jump in after the game's official launch last Thursday, an impressive result for a new IP from a medium-sized developer. It's not the only multiplayer game boasting huge player counts at the moment, either. Battlefield 6 managed a massive 747,000 concurrent players earlier in the month, off the back of a mostly-well-received launch. Of course, there's no one single reason why both of these games attracted so many players to their respective worlds. Battlefield 6 is the latest entry in a long and storied series, whereas Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter formula and refined it down to an easy to learn, hard to master point, to name just two. But I'll tell you one thing I think has made a major difference to those player uptake numbers—low hardware requirements.

It seems OpenAI didn't quite get this memo, as it's being accused of infringing copyright. Shueisha recently put out a statement aimed at OpenAI , and specifically its Sora 2 video generator. At the end of September, we got a glimpse of Sora 2, and one of the first viral posts from this tool was deemed \" Temu Blue Exorcist \", which is a reference to another manga published by Shueisha. This isn't the first time OpenAI's AI generation tools were used to ape anime and manga, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even sharing a picture of himself in Studio Ghibli style . As of the time of writing, Altman's profile picture on X is still in Ghibli style. That statement says (machine translated): \"These videos, which infringe on copyrights for anime and characters, were generated using AI learning. Advances in generative AI should be wel…",

What possible benefit could this have, you ask? Well, lower latency is the obvious answer. In other words, less lag between stabbing a key and having something happen in-game and on-screen. The question is, of course, at what point does lower latency become undetectable to human senses? According to MCHOSE itself, the 16 kHz version of the Ace 68 Turbo only improves latency over the (presumably cheaper) 8 KHz variant by 0.02 ms, with the Turbo sitting at 0.06 ms rather than 0.08 ms. So, we are talking about hundredths of a millisecond. Can anyone actually feel that? Cue an army of twitch gamers pointing out the huge benefits of 8 kHz mice and how they couldn't possibly slum it with—eugh!—a 4 KHz rodent. Or whatever. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that the idea of a, say, 500 Hz monitor seemed a bit silly. Surely anything beyond about 240 Hz was beyond human perception?

And if that's the case, it raises the question as to how Amazon is going to cope now that it's signed a $38 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI to give the company access to its servers. It was Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, who made the point about insufficient power in a 70-minute interview (via Tom's Hardware ) with YouTube channel Bg2 Pod, alongside OpenAI's boss, Sam Altman. It came about when the interview's host, Brad Gerstner, mentioned that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang had said that there was almost zero chance of there being a 'compute glut' within the next couple of years (and by that, he means an excess of AI GPUs). \"The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power,\" replied Nadella. \"It’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power.

You also get some capsules which you can fill with letters or frogs (I'll explain that bit later) and a pile of letters that your helpful and slightly creepy assistant brings you. Your job is to figure out which letters are real and which aren't. There's a checklist you can refer to that helps narrow it down. Is the letter addressed to a real person or department? Is the information correct? And is it an ad? If so, hurl it into the flames. As fa…",

Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points.

Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.
