According to Microsoft, though, the issue isn't a compute or hardware limit, it's that there's not enough electrical power to run it all. And if that's the case, it raises the question as to how Amazon is going to cope now that it's signed a $38 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI to give the company access to its servers. It was Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, who made the point about insufficient power in a 70-minute interview (via Tom's Hardware ) with YouTube channel Bg2 Pod, alongside OpenAI's boss, Sam Altman. It came about when the interview's host, Brad Gerstner, mentioned that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang had said that there was almost zero chance of there being a 'compute glut' within the next couple of years (and by that, he means an excess of AI GPUs). \"The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power,\" replied Nadella. \"It’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power. So, if you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that …",

There are no reheated nachos to speak of here. Before you ask, yes, the buttons are functional; besides typing in '1337' and hitting 'start' to boot the contraption, those microwave buttons have been repurposed to also offer Stream Deck functionality. Naturally, everything inside and out has been lined in RGB lighting too.

Consistently impressive through its early access development, the enormous 1.0 version was crowned \"one of the greatest survival crafting games ever made\" by Morgan Park in his Abiotic Factor Review . While I haven't delved as deeply as Morgan, I've likewise been bedazzled by its sumptuous survival adventure through a vast underground facility and branching pocket dimensions. Following the 1.0 launch, Deep Field Games could easily have clocked out from their years-long shift at the GATE Cascade Research Facility. Instead, they've been burning the midnight oil, supplementing their energy with cans of sugary Pop Snarkle and nourishing alien soup. The result is a beefy new update for Abiotic Factor that adds whole new ways to enjoy and/or suffer through its Half-Life-inspired science maze. Primarily, the 1.1 update adds two new modes—Hardcore mode and Iron mode. Hardcore Mode is, frankly, ridiculous, forcing Abiotic Factor's 'Apocalyptic' difficulty setting with the added challenge of losing everything if you die. Progress can be reset by server admins should they deem it necessary, but Deep Field stresses \"that is the cowar…",

Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale.

Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips shall continue to be kept out of China. When Norah O'Donnell of CBS' 60 Minutes specifically asked the US president about allowing Nvidia to sell their most advanced chips in China, Trump said \"No, we won't do that. We will let them [China], uh, deal with Nvidia.\" During the extended version of his latest CBS 60 Minutes interview , US president Donald Trump also said, \"The most advanced [AI chips], we will not let anybody have them other than the United States\" (via Reuters ). It's surprising, not just considering the fact that Nvidia is the first company in the world to reach a $5 trillion valuation , but also company CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments that the US needs to \"go compete\" with its AI chips in China. Trump's comments are surprising in part as they follow hot on the heels of news that the US president and Chinese president Xi Jinping have agreed on a one-year trade truce at the end of last month. Apparently, the subject of the Blackwell chips simply never came up during these trade talks. These latest comments also don't rule out all of Nvidia's chips being sold in China, with Trump saying back in August t…",

In a way, it feels like this was bound to happen. The day after Sora 2, the latest iteration of OpenAI's text-to-video technology, went live, PC Gamer's Jess Kinghorn described the system as capable of \"spitting out all of the soulless, AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style animation one could ever want.\" Just a few days later, someone posted a Sora 2-generated video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman standing in a field with frolicking Pokémon, saying, \"I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us.\" All of this has attracted the attention of CODA, an organization founded in 2002 to combat piracy and promote Japanese videogames, film, music, animation, and television programs worldwide. Somewhat ironically under the circumstances, Nintendo is not a CODA member, although Studio Ghibli is. \"CODA has confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese conten…",

The series that put the Swedish studio on the map has been missing in action since 2018, and if the words of its creator are anything to go by, we won't be seeing another one any time soon, if ever. In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

I'll be honest, I've never really understood the 'RPG to action game' pipeline that many popular series—and studios—have gone through. Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true. At the very least, it's not true right now.

In this mission, you're tasked by Tian Wen with investigating whether one of her caches in the Buried City has been tampered with. Thankfully, it's an outskirt location, so you don't have to worry about venturing into town to contend with patrolling Arcs or loot-hungry players. All that said, here's how to complete Marked for Death in Arc Raiders. Reach Su Durante Warehouses in the Outskirts in Buried City The Su Durante Warhouses are in the north of Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step in the Marked for Death quest is making your way to the Su Durante Warehouses in the north of the Buried City. This is a fairly easy location to get to, depending on your spawn, but since it's on the outskirts rather than in the centre, you can expect far fewer players and Arcs.
