    "body": "Like the rest of the tech world and its LLM-powered pooch, Microsoft has been on a big AI push of late . Its latest achievement in that regard is the rollout of agentic AI capabilities for Windows 11 courtesy of the 26220.7262 update (via Windows Latest ). Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process. Microsoft also says the new agentic AI …",

Speranza's resident explosives peddler, Apollo, asks you to find three books in the city library, namely a detective, romance, and adventure book. The genres don't matter much; you just have to find three specific stands inside the building. With a metro station right outside (provided it's still open), I'd recommend using a free loadout for this one. Otherwise, here's where to find those three books for the Building a Library quest. How to complete Building a Library in Arc Raiders The Library is just north of Marano Park in Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) To start, you'll want to head to the Library in the centre of the Buried City, just at the north end of Marano Park. This area is a little dicey, considering the park is often patrolled by a Bombardier or Bastion, and there's usually a Rocketeer hovering above Marano Station to the west.

However, cosmetics usually mean microtransactions, but if alarm bells are ringing in your head you can rest assured that semiwork will not be adding any sort of in-game store (aside from the one you already visit in the game) where you can buy new cosmetics and customise your bot.

Earlier this month, piratical survival sim Salt 2 weighed its early access anchor and sailed into the 1.0-pen ocean, while this week saw the release of Captain Wayne: Vacation Desperation , a buccaneer-tinged blaster built in the original Doom engine. Then there's supernatural seafaring adventure Davy x Jones . Originally launched in August, Davy x Jones is a roguelike FPS where you play a headless freebooter named Jones, battling through the underworld in first-person combat while accompanied by a chatty skull companion named Davy. Davy x Jones enjoyed a pleasant, if quiet reception on its early access release, with players praising its imagination but criticising its rough edges. But the shooter has just had its hull thoroughly careened, with a massive update expanding and overhauling its fundamentals in significant ways. Chiefly, the update doubles Davy x Jones' scope by adding a second mode of play, letting players helm a \"living ship\" as they explore the underworld in third-person sailing. Said ship is actually a hybrid with a wooden hull and a cosmic space whale. I…",

    "body": "Back in 2023, South Korean developer Wonder Potion released Sanabi , a sleek, cyberpunk-themed action platformer that saw players slinging themselves around levels with a giant grappling hook. Favourably compared to Katana Zero , it received near-universal praise for its crisp pixel art, Bionic Commando-esque platforming challenges, and surprisingly involved storyline. Two years on from Sanabi's launch, Wonder Potion has now released an expansion for Sanabi. Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump. She also wields a massive shotgun—which I always find endearing i…",

If you've found yourself (or someone you love (sorry)) wishing for a more material mecha pastime, Gundam plastic models—or Gunpla—will get you there. A word of warning: Gunpla sickness settles in fast. I only built my first kit about a year and a half ago, but as I write this, there are two displayed mobile suits, three assembled models in boxes, and one unopened kit awaiting assembly in my field of vision.

He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

Eurogamer highlighted a LinkedIn post that shared the story of how it came to be. Embark's marketing lead, Ashley St. Germain, said of the cameo: \"There’s a lot to be thankful for this year, but I don’t know how I’m going to top this week. On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play Arc Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in season 28’s 'Turkey Trot' episode.
