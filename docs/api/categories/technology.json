    "body": "Arc Raiders has plenty of annoying materials to track down for various upgrades, like prickly pears , olives , and mushrooms for Scrappy, but I'd argue none are more annoying than Sentinel Firing Cores . You need to grab four of these pesky Arc items before you can upgrade your Gunsmith to level three, which is quite the challenge. As obvious as it sounds, it's worth pointing out that you get these Firing Cores from Arc Sentinels, which are sniper turrets attached to ceilings in just a few specific locations, and are different to the regular turrets you commonly encounter. You're less likely to run into these naturally compared to almost all other Arc types. With that in mind, tracking them down for their cores proves to be a time-consuming task. However, alongside the Sentinels themselves, there's also another great way to get them. So, here's where to look.

Usually, I'd say these people would have to pay for extraction camping in another life, but it seems like they're actually paying for it right here and now in Arc Raiders thanks to a few zealous players. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Reverse extraction camping, or extraction protecting, has gained popularity in Arc Raiders as players choose to spend their time waiting at extraction points to ensure others can get home safely. One such player is Boschmerchant, Keeper of the Swamp extraction , a raider who hangs around the swamp extraction in Dam Battlegrounds, protecting those who fall under his care and calling the extraction point.

The quest itself gives you a pretty big clue as to where to find the Flood Access Tunnel, mentioning that it's underneath Red Lake Balcony, but this isn't technically correct. The tunnel is a little ways off to the side of the balcony, explaining why this might be tripping you up. So, here's how to complete Water Troubles in Arc Raiders. Locate the Flood Access Tunnel under the Red Lake Balcony You can find the Flood Access Tunnel pipe directly to the east of the Control Tower on the basin floor (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step is pretty straightforward; you'll want to head into the big basin area in the east of the Dam Battlegrounds map—be careful if the Harvester event is active, because this is where the queen likes to patrol.

As part of the monster update, REPO received a bunch of new valuables too, each corresponding to their location rather than being a random selection available through each map.

And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered the best PC games you can play right now and a running list of the 2025 games that are launching this year.

Our only solace seems to be other developers picking up the torch of those big, cinematic, ensemble cast, wish fulfilling RPGs: Larian, CDProjekt, and now, maybe Owlcat with its distinctly Mass Effect-y upcoming take on the Expanse, Osiris Reborn. On November 7, Owlcat shared the game's main theme from composer Paweł Perepelica, who previously scored Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader for the studio. It's hard get crazy excited about music from an upcoming game, but Osiris Reborn's main theme kinda goes. That combination of a very space opera, orchestral sound with more cyberpunk synths puts me right back in that 2007, saving the galaxy headspace. It doesn't hurt that Mass Effect and The Expanse draw from the same well of gritty, '90s and aughts, military-inflected, Sci-Fi Syfy Channel sci-fi⁠—even if Mass Effect tempered it with a more wide eyed, mid-20th century sensibility. I'm curious to see how Owlcat does when it branches out from isometric CRPGs into an action RPG direction. At times, it's reminded me of…",

Speaking more to the former instinct, Microsoft is teaming up with Boeing to put that high-fidelity simulation to work in a virtual training program for novice pilots. As noted in a press release from Boeing, the Virtual Airplane Procedures Trainer was announced last Thursday at the European Aviation Training Summit in Portugal. The release notes the new program is \"powered by Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Flight Simulator,\" and is \"designed to empower pilots and flight training teams with immersive, accessible and customizable tools that elevate pilot learning and readiness.\" It won't replace the physical flight simulators of yore but instead \"reduce simulator familiarization time,\" as the release notes. It's also, to be clear, not Microsoft Flight Simulator—just a virtual trainer that uses the sim as a foundation in some capacity. There's a video showing off an overview of the trainer and its associated regimen on Boeing's website , and it seems primarily driven by a lesson plan th…",

It’s also a sort of digital coffee table book replete with interviews, historical blurbs, and quaint reimaginings of the games it archives. It’s because that core game was so good I’m actually excited to play another compilation of Bandai Namco’s 80s classics—Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, anything you’d expect to see wallowing in the corner of a local greasy spoon. In a DLC announced earlier this year without a release window, those games and a few others will finally be woven into the collection this Thursday, Nov. 13. If you’re like me, you have more Namco compilations and miscellaneous ports of Pac-Man than you know what to do with, but this is more than just another re-release. On top of the archived art, photos, and developer interviews, this DLC is set to include three Atari ports of Pac-Man: 2600, 5200, and the version released on Atari 8-bit computers. According to the Steam page , this is the first time these games have ever reared their ugly heads in an official re-…",

The publisher didn't provide any reason for Deadlock's delisting. The most plausible explanation is an expired licensing agreement, though it is worth noting that Deadlock partly shares its name with Valve's upcoming multiplayer shooter . Not that I'm suggesting any kind of weird conspiracy on Valve's part to kill off a relatively obscure space strategy game from 2017. But it is an interesting coincidence. In any case, Slitherine points out that players who already own the game (or purchase it in the next week) \"can continue playing it without any restrictions.\" Deadlock is well worth picking up if you're into either tactical …",
