But honestly, all I ever really wanted was a good skin. A nice unique cosmetic was always my primary motivation for doing the Expedition project, not just because of the bragging rights, but because I like cosmetic options in games. Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam. But now the Expedition window has actually opened up and we can see a thumbnail of the outfit, things are looking good . As TheWreckedTitan points out on Reddit, the Expedition skin is most likely the tutorial skin we all wore at the start of the game, a cool little cosmetic that makes you look like y…",

It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions,\" he says. In mitigation, Enzor-DeMeo also says that the AI element in Firefox will be optional. \"First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off,\" Enzor-DeMeo explains. While Mozilla says that the transition to AI will be a three-year process, it's also clear that they don't plan to hang about. \"We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths,\" Enzor-DeMeo goes on.

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

If you lose the key, it's basically up to RNG whether you get another, so you're a bit stuck. Luckily, the locked room at Pilgrim's Peak, where you have to go, has a lot more foot traffic, so chances are even without the key, you'll still be able to get it.

I'm gonna join everyone else in assuming this is either a bug or a temporary, unspoken bonus to encourage players to engage in the deadlier map condition. Either way, it's almost surely temporary.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.

Videogame musical? Hell yeah— I dug Stray Gods' blend of musical theatre and visual novel —and a turn-based RPG to boot? The little Final Fantasy sicko who's been living in my brain for the last 20 years is hootin' and hollerin' right now. The game first made an appearance during our very own PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct , and last week's Day of the Devs gave us an extended look at one of the songs that'll be in the game, Under the Lights. It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note. I have to admit that has me a little jazzed. With game director Jason Wishnov promising the discography will journey through the likes of \"rock, EDM, and so many…",

In a post-show interview, Swen Vincke explained to us where that ambition is going: More choices, deeper reactivity, bigger consequences, and thoroughly interconnected storylines. \"The level of agency that we're going to give you is very, very high⁠—much higher than what happened in BG3. At least that's our ambition,\" Vincke said. \"And this is agency at pretty much all levels, so it's at the narrative as well as systems level. That makes it our most ambitious. It's the biggest game that we've ever made.\" Asked whether this will be in terms of sheer volume of choices, or their depth, Vincke said that it's both, but that there would also be \"longer, deeper sequences of consequence.\" \"One of the things that gives my heart joy when I play our games is when the things click into each other⁠—the narrative, the systems themselves,\" Vincke said. \"When you have several situations that are going on and they all click into each other, and they feel like a consequence of things, then it becomes really, really good.\" For me, this called to mind some of the quests in Act 3…",

Beyond simply finding the tunnels, you'll also have to track down the Filtration System down there. Once that's done, you're heading to Blue Gate to find a Purification System in a bunker as well, so this quest is fairly long, necessitating two runs as it does. I'll walk you through all the steps to finish it below. If you don't want to risk gear, this is definitely a good quest for a free loadout , since you don't have to extract anything valuable. Search four containers in the underground tunnels You can enter the underground tunnels near the Launch Towers (Image credit: Embark Studios) This first step is pretty straightforward if you remember the underground tunnel location from the Switching the Supply quest.

Speaking to PCGamesN , the voice actor for Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion, Neil Newbon (who knows a little bit about voice acting because he's won friggin awards for it ), was very down on AI voiceover, echoing statements both he and his fellow BG3 cast members have made before on the subject: \"Comparatively speaking, the amount of money it costs to do those voice lines compared to the rest of the game's development is peanuts. When a game's successful, I don't really get why [developers] don't go 'well, at the time we couldn't afford to do it—it was too much or too difficult—but now we've been super successful, why don't we go back and actually redo the lines with actors?'

Considering the last thing you want to be doing is searching the swamp while there are other potentially loot-hungry Raiders on the prowl, here's what you need to do. I'd recommend foregoing a free loadout for this one, since a key you might need later drops at the end, and as we know with the Armored Transports quest, losing keys required for missions is a pain.
