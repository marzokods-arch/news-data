    "body": "The PC gaming industry is now essentially a repeating cycle of product announcements generating an excitable 'ooh' followed immediately by a sigh of recognition: this isn't for me. Case in point is my reaction upon hearing about the \"most powerful gaming laptop on the planet\"— 'ooh!' —followed by the immediate dual recognition that this will be very expensive and probably very loud and scarcely worth unplugging from the mains— 'oh, yeah' . It is undeniably impressive, however, that MSI is packing very powerful hardware in such a small form factor. The company says about the Raider 16 Max HX and Raider 16 HX: \"Don’t let its size fool you. The Raider 16 Max HX is the world’s first gaming laptop capable of delivering a massive 300W total system power. Under full-load conditions, it unleashes 175W to the RTX 5090 or 5080, while simultaneously feeding 125W to the Intel Core Ultra 200HX processor—making it the most powerful gaming laptop on the planet.\" What's also impressive, and a welcome seeming trend for CES this year, is an element of modularity to these Raider laptops.

Announced at CES 2026 (via Wccftech ), Schenker has shown off the first semi-modular laptop based on Intel's Panther Lake. Last year, Intel unveiled a reference semi-modular design in its blog, and this Schenker design is the first to roll out a finished product with it. The Schenker Element 16, which is reportedly launching in Spring 2026, has an Intel Core Ultra Series 3, with support for up to 64 GB of memory. We don't yet know what the price point is or when orders will open up. As displayed on the Bestware website , there's a small latch on the bottom of the laptop, which can be flicked to get access to the internals. From there, you can take off and replace the keyboard, swap out the storage and memory, replace the battery and fans, and you can even customise the ports on the sides of the device. Wccftech says that future motherboard upgrades are planned, meaning you can swap the Series 3 chip out for something else, if available. The fact that this is based on an Intel design, however, does suggest you will only be upgrading to future Intel chips. Imag…",

I'll help us get started: There seem to be the slight rumblings of a focus on local rather than cloud AI by the big hardware companies, which could spell good news for the PC gaming industry and, dare I say it, the memory market. Primarily, these rumblings have come from AMD's CES 2026 keynote , but there's also a glimmer of hope granted by Nvidia, too. On the former front, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su actually spent a fair amount of time talking about local AI. Admittedly, much of this was in the form of bigging up the company's new mobile chips, the Ryzen AI 400-series , which is essentially the Strix Point 300-series with some clock speed bumps. But that's to be expected, and hardly goes against my point: these companies still want people to be using devices—preferably ones with their silicon—and if AI is all the rage, local AI on devices is a big selling point.

Where things get confusing is that these two monitors in fact use completely different OLED panels. To cut a long story short, Asus has a new 34-inch ultrawide that sports Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel technology. Meanwhile, Asus is also announcing a 27-inch 4K model, this time with LG's newest panel tech. And what both panels share is RGB stripe subpixels. Previously, Samsung's QD-OLED panels have used RGB—or red, green and blue—subpixels, but arranged in an unusual triangular pattern instead of the vertical \"stripes\" seen in pretty much all LCD monitors. LG's OLED tech has actually used vertical stripe subpixels, but with an additional white subpixel, hence the \"WOLED\" branding. In both cases, not using a standard RGB stripe subpixel arrangement can cause problems whenever subpixel addressing is used for rendering, most obviously with text and fonts. Anywho, with all that squared away, let's get to those new monitor models. The Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDN is the 34-inch ultrawide model with the Samsung QD-OLED panel. Indeed,…",

It comes with a dual-density cold-cure foam seat, which Razer says goes \"without that trapped heat feeling.\" The Newgen comes with Razer's own 'Hyperflex lumbar support'.

    "body": "Ah, CES. Half AI, a quarter prototypes that seem finetuned for a headline, and a quarter genuinely useful tech. With Project Motoko, Razer seems intent on hitting at least three quarters of that market. Announced today, Project Motoko is a gaming headset with a Snapdragon chip that reportedly has AI computer vision and universal AI platform compatibility. With dual 3K 60 fps cameras, Razer says it could theoretically look at what's in front of you and use an AI model to take in data. It could then give gaming advice, tell you what's in front of you, or anything else you would traditionally use a chatbot for. The first-person view means you can also stream or record video, much like the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses . Razer tells us it comes with optical image stabilization, which should help with the whole 'two cameras strapped to the side of your head' thing. However, there's a less traditional use case here that is oh so Razer. In the pre-presentation briefing I attended, I was informed that Project Motoko can be used to give advice for the game you are playing. How it manages to accurately identify the game, then use that data to give you context-specific advice, is anyone's guess,…",

    "body": "Last year, Corsair released the Sabre V2 Pro , and it quickly took its place as my favourite mouse since the launch of the original Logitech G Pro X Superlight . That's because I'm a fan of lightweight mice for competitive FPS gaming, and the Sabre V2 Pro shoves that whole segment forward at an incredibly light 36 g. Now, Corsair has announced new versions of the Sabre V2 Pro, but these are going to be a whole 20 g heavier, making me wonder where, exactly, they'll land in terms of their target markets. The newly announced Sabre V2 Pro CF and Sabre V2 Pro MG are slightly bigger versions with \"longer battery life and tri-mode connectivity\", the former having a carbon fiber body and the latter a magnesium alloy body. Perhaps surprisingly, the MG version is the cheaper of the two, going for $150 / £120, while the CF version is priced at $200 / £160. That price difference probably has something to do with all the holes in its shell—less material, less money. It's also one of the things that disappoints me a little about it, in combination with the weight and the price. What's so great about the original Sabre V2 Pro is that it offers a genuinely unmatched light weight without being pok…",

Now there's a new version, and this one might go at least some way towards boosting that up. That's primarily because this is a Hall effect keyboard. One of Phil's problems with the first version was that it all added up to quite a lot of money after adding the various parts to the DIY kit, and you didn't have the option to get Hall effect switches for that price tag. The just-announced MAKR Pro 75, though, has Hall effect switches, and they're included in its price tag… which is still steep at $250/£220, so it's not exactly a clear value improvement overall from first glance. For those who want Hall effect switches in a dinky 75% form factor that thocks as good as many other enthusiast keyboards, it should be a good shout, though. Phil said the non-Pro has a \"tank-like chassis construction\", and it looks like that'll be the same with the new one, too. Apart from the chassis, we're talking an FR4 plate, gasket mounting, and 8-layer sound dampening, which will all help that so…",

(Image credit: Future) Intel has also promised much improvement in its GPU driver stack, which, if true, could make these mobile beasties a force to be reckoned with for slim and light gaming machines. Key to the claimed performance figures are the architectural changes under the silicon hood. Next to some newly-redesigned P and E-cores lies what Intel calls a \"massive GPU\" for the high end Core Ultra X7 and X9 chips, complete with built-in ray tracing support. The iGPU in qu…",

    "body": "At this year's CES event, AMD hasn't really introduced anything completely new in its consumer CPU portfolio. They've either rebadged old chips or just expanded current ranges with a few more models. However, the Ryzen AI Max series of APUs has picked up two extra processors, and one of them could well be the best chip to fit into any top-tier handheld gaming PC. As a quick refresher, Ryzen AI Max processors (aka Strix Halo ) comprise one or two core chiplets (CCDs) plus a huge input/output chiplet (IOD) that houses a pretty beefy GPU. It has 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units (2560 shaders), with 64 MB of Level 3 cache, and a unified memory bus that's 256-bits wide. (Image credit: AMD) Up until now, the only entry in the series that sported the full 40 CUs was the very expensive Ryzen AI Max+ 395 . That all changes with the two new chips: the Max+ 392 and Max+ 388. The former has two CCDs for 12 cores, 24 threads in total, whereas the latter uses a single CCD sporting 8 cores, 16 threads. The current Ryzen AI Max 385 is also a single CCD chip, but its GPU only houses 32 CUs. With the Max+ 388, you're getting the best Strix Halo processor for gaming: 8 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores/CUs.

    "body": "HyperX, the gaming hardware brand acquired by HP back in 2021, now makes gaming monitors. Well, that's not strictly true. HP makes the monitors, but the newly-announced HyperX Omen OLED 34 looks to be the start of some very tempting offerings, if its impressive specs sheet is anything to go by. It's a 360 Hz 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide, for a start. That puts it in the upper echelons of gaming monitor desirability right from the off, as QD-OLED panels feature in some of our favourite displays . It's got a 0.03 ms response time, as you'd expect from an OLED display, which, combined with the super-speedy refresh rate, should make it a pretty lust-worthy monitor for anyone with a fast-paced multiplayer game obsession. High up on the spec sheet is what's referred to as \"next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED panel technology\", which HP says provides much improvement to the picture quality with less text fringing. V-stripe refers to a particular type of sub-pixel layout that puts the green sub-pixel above the red and the blue, creating an inverted \"V\". Early iterations of the tech were prone to blurry text rendering, but the new version is said to sharpen things up considerably—although it's n…",
