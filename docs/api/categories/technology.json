    "body": "It's been five years since Valheim revitalized the survival craft genre. At the time I remember thinking \"why would anyone want to play a new game in this style when there's already Minecraft, Ark and Rust?\". With the benefit of hindsight I know that two things worked in Valheim's favour. One was its clever finetuning of survival and building systems that still felt really clunky in competing games, and which many have since adopted. The other thing was Vikings. Valheim ruled so much that it was our favourite game of 2021 , and that was largely thanks to Vikings. Five years later Valheim is still in early access, but its updates come thick and fast and its community seems, by and large, pretty happy with how things are going. To celebrate the milestone, Iron Gate has issued a special anniversary update, or \"Patch 0.221.10\" in more prosaic terms. It features a bunch of nice things, like \"a celebratory hat\", a new weapon in the form of early axes (they're basically ancient dual-wieldable axes), and frosted sweetbread, which is a new consumable. There's a new radial menu for emotes, from which you can trigger new happy emotes like \"vibe\" or \"love you\" (do not perform the despair emot…",

Handheld stuff is not our major focus. Also, we had some concerns that this could become a 'bureaucratic loophole', which seems to be more or less true so far. \"Additionally, to us all this 'initiative' looked like an emergency rushed thing, so that Bazzite finds new kernel maintainers and for other technical stuff after kicking the maintainer, which basically made most integration work for them.\" The dev also expressed that the company doesn't want to be associated with Playtron, another somewhat controversial distro that's part of the OGC.

    "body": "I completed my final year of university during the pandemic and spent the last five years of my life working from home, and I gotta say… sometimes it freaking sucks butt. I'm a yapper at heart, a jester in an empty court. Days where I'm practically vibrating with pent-up energy and a desire for socialisation instead ping and ricochet off the four walls of my lonely living-room-slash-office-slash-gaming-space. As anyone who's spent any sort of time living, studying, or working solo from home will know; those vibes can quickly contort themselves into very unproductive habits. A five-minute flick through the phone turns into a full-blown doomscroll sesh. A quick YouTube pitstop becomes an hour of scrolling through Shorts—seriously, who's actually watching those regurgitated Instagram Reels and TikToks outside of an intense procrastination sesh? (Image credit: Future Friends Games) It's frustrating. I've tried the wealth of productivity tools the internet has done its best to market as the ultimate work-slash-study-from-home life hack. Some of them have kinda worked— like Spirit Swap —but never for as long as I need them to . The thing that's been missing all along? Doing them alongsi…",

When they're crossing load screens they can't open them all the way—because then the other side would have to be rendered—and so they pop doors open a crack revealing a sliver of darkness, then fade out of existence like the guy in that one meme. I remember looking for a mod to replace that with fuller animations back in the day and learning it would be completely impossible. (Deleting the door-opening animation altogether was on the table though, thanks to the Get On With It mod .) Given the whole process is necessarily artificial, it never struck me how bizarre it looks in the instant before the fade—when the NPC about to vanish lights up like they've just been plugged into the mains. As well as all shadows on them disappearing their hair looks super weird, vanishing from their eyebrows, sideburns, and the nape of the neck as the transparencies suddenly fail. Watching the video by modder wSkeever really makes it impossible to ignore. They light up like Uncle Fester with a lightbulb in his mouth, which is why the No Load Door NPC Fade mod is such a blessing. It's a one-kilobyte download, and immediately joins my list …",

    "body": "Highguard has fielded all sorts of opinions since it launched Monday. I'm not huge on it , but PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park spoke more positively of it in his impressions —though he did say it's \"ill-timed\" given the larger shift toward more casual, chaotic fun that shooters are taking right now. It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why. The game's raid mode is tense and tactical at the best of times, but it never really feels like a 'raid': giant battering ram aside, it's still just six people fighting over a sword and then a handful of buildings. Ten isn't that much more, but it is more. As someone whose FPS tas…",

    "body": "There's no greater pain in a MOBA than seeing your favorite hero swept into the swirling void of unplayability by a hero ban, but it’s a necessary evil, at least for buttoned-up ranked play. Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.
