When it comes to phones, though, it's a tad more difficult, especially if the device in question is an iPhone 17 Pro Max. And when I say tad , I actually mean a hugely complicated feat of highly-skilled engineering, as one modder amply demonstrates. Apple's latest iPhone 17 Pro Max , the most expensive one in the released launched lineup, is available with four storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB. There's a $200 price tag difference between the first three, and because of the size of the capacity jump, a $400 gap between the 1 and 2 TB models. Unfortunately, there's no SD card slot or the like, so you can't change how much storage you have once you've bought one. Well, actually you can , though as DirectorFeng on YouTube shows, it's really not straightforward at all. With immaculate presentation and attention to detail, DirectorFeng's lengthy-but-lovely video takes you through every step involved in replacing the 256 GB SSD module in an iPhone 17 Pro Max with a 1 TB one (they had planned to use a 2 TB module but couldn't…",

The first is from The Korea Economic Daily (via Bloomberg ), which claims that Samsung's HBM3E RAM chips have finally passed Nvidia's qualification tests for use in its AI mega-processors. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of RAM where multiple memory dies are stacked together to create a single module that can sustain a huge amount of data traffic per second. Samsung's most recent version of this tech, HBM3E , hadn't been meeting expectations , leaving competitor SK Hynix as the sole provider of the special memory for Nvidia. That no longer seems to be the case, though, given that its HBM3E has only just been approved, it will be some while before order books are full to bursting. Still, it's good news as far as the stock market is concerned, as Bloomberg points out that current prices are roughly 20% higher than expectations. What's certainly helping here i…",

The finalist names that went up for a public vote were selected from a pool of over a thousand by railway historian and British TV host Tim Dunn, along with the UK's rail minister Lord Hendy and Lisa Angus, Network Rail's Weather Response Director.

Granted, it also tends to create a lot of bugs and dead ends in the process. But when Shadows of Doubt works, it's one of the best games ever made. Yet the latest update somehow makes Shadows of Doubt even more conceptually appealing, by letting you play as a detective who is also a rat. The modifiers update injects a bunch of optional mutations into the sim's algorithmic genes, one of which lets you prowl its rain-slicked alleys as a trenchcoat-wearing rodent. Simply titled \"rat detective\", the modifier shrinks your character down to a mere 10cm tall, letting you experience the powers and perils of being a city-dwelling rodent. The advantage of being a rat detective is you can climb on walls and ceilings, and sneak past people more easily. The downside is that you can't question people, and citizens may even be hostile to your presence. I gave the rat detective …",

    "summary": "Is Microsoft's \"Gaming Copilot\" a helpful assistant or just more bloatware?",
    "body": "Microsoft’s Copilot AI is officially coming to the Xbox Game Bar on PC starting this week. The new “Gaming Copilot” feature was announced just last month and, as of Thursday it's already beginning its full beta roll-out to PC and coming to the Xbox mobile app in October. As the name suggests, it’s a gaming-specific version of Copilot that Microsoft calls “your personal gaming sidekick.” You can use Gaming Copilot to ask for tips, suggestions, summaries, info on achievements, and the like. It can analyze what’s on your screen for context, such as identifying an NPC you’re talking to (although their names are usually on screen anyway). You’re able to access this assistant directly through the Xbox Game Bar⁠—by default, pressing Windows+G on a keyboard or the Xbox button on one of the company's controllers. There’s also a voice mode and a \"mini mode\" for pinning the AI to your screen. While I can see how some gamers might find this useful, it's hard to see how it's more than an AI version of simply pulling up a guide on your phone or via the Steam browser. It also raises concerns about the potential for cheating in online games. After all, being able to ask an AI for live, personaliz…",

    "summary": "Deep of Night is getting some balancing updates, but don't go thinking it won't still be brutal.",
    "body": "If you've been playing Elden Ring Nightreign's intense new Deep of Night mode, you may have noticed your Depth level ranking sometimes doesn't increase as it should after a victory. That glitch and some much-needed quality-of-life tweaks are getting addressed in an upcoming patch Bandai Namco announced on Friday. Along with a fix for the Depth level increase bug, this patch will also give you an option to voluntarily decrease your Depth level and add Depth level demotion protection for level three onward. You gain points toward promotion for winning runs, and lose points when you fail, meaning it's possible to be demoted, similar to competitive multiplayer ranks in other games. This new protection feature effectively gives you a second chance to hang on when you would otherwise get demoted starting at Depth level three. You then get two extra chances for levels four and five each. Lastly, this patch will also allow Steam players to return to an ongoing session if they get disconnected due to Steam server issues. The voluntary demotion, meanwhile, lets you turn down the heat if you need more practice or want to better accommodate lower-ranked friends. If you've tried the new Deep o…",

We got the first screenshots and pitch for Penguin Colony back in June: A reimagining of H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, told from the perspective of a penguin. The original story centers on the discovery of an impossible lost city in the Antarctic and, it must be said, is told from the perspective of a Miskatonic University guy who goes crazy from all the alien stuff, not a penguin. Miskatonic U. faculty were some of Howard Philips Lovecraft's favorite guys to drive cuckoo, you see. The game's narrator, Howard Blakely, is a new character played by Brown, speaking to the penguin protagonist over vast distances⁠—though he's still a Miskatonic man. \"Our narrator is part of an expedition which has gone horribly wrong,\" Penguin Colony's Steam page explains. \"Having been called by the old ones, his brain no longer experiences time linearly.
