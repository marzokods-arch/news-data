    "body": "A newly-published paper entitled \" Vibe coding kills open source \" makes the claim that everyone's favourite new hobby—that is, using AI tools to code their own products—is actively damaging the developers of open source software. \"Vibe coding raises productivity by lowering the cost of using and building on existing code, but it also weakens the user engagement through which many maintainers earn returns,\" says the paper, which was authored by several experts from various universities and institutes on the topic. \"When OSS is monetized only through direct user engagement, greater adoption of vibe coding lowers entry and sharing, reduces the availability and quality of OSS, and reduces welfare despite higher productivity,\" the paper continues. Speaking to The Register , one of the co-authors of the paper, university professor Miklós Koren, said: \"We know that developers have adopted vibe coding very fast. [Anthropic CEO] Dario Amodei has famously said that ' 70, 80, 90 percent of the code written in Anthropic is written by Claude .' So users of vibe coding find it easy to switch to this mode of building software. This implies that human attention towards producers of OSS is shrink…",

A roguelike deckbuilder lives or dies on its mechanics, however, and heading into a run with an early build of the game, I was at first worried Mechborn might be style over substance.

Profits, meanwhile, hit $33 billion, giving the company stellar operating margins of 49%. Compared to 2024, revenues climbed by 47%. However, profits slightly more than doubled. Long story short, SK Hynix didn't just sell more stuff. It made more money on every sale. This does not exactly come as a surprise. The prices of pretty much all memory-related products have been spiralling upwards of late. But the cost of producing memory products has surely not increased as much. The result, pretty obviously from SK Hynix's published results, is that a lot more money is being made on each memory chip. So, apart from the obvious upside for SK Hynix's shareholders, is there any good news here?

After we'd become more familiar, however, I'd certainly put Resident Evil heartthrob Leon Kennedy on the list. Modders put him in a thong within 0.1 picoseconds of the RE4 remake coming out, after all. Which is why he made ripples on the internet when it was revealed that not only would he be in the new Resident Evil game , but also that he's also in his DILF era. He's all hot uncle, now. He's downright foxy. Awooga, awooga, eyes pop out of head, look at the silver in that beard—you get the picture. This is something that, according to director Koshi Nakanishi, who spoke to Automaton in a recent joint interview , is due to the fine tastes of the women on the development team, who clearly know exactly what they're about because—and I say this as a known men-liker—god damn . \"We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the fine…",

Build a little house that doesn't move and live inside it? Get with the program! This year the survival genre is ditching those sad wooden huts in favor of mobile bases, and those bases are all trains . There are at least six—possibly seven—survival games set on moving trains all coming out in 2026! Why the sudden rush to make survival games about trains?
