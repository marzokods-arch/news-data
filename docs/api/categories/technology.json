We have, of course, been 'proving' we're human for many years now, though it's always been easy to forget that's what those CAPTCHA tasks are up to. Now, though, with AI becoming increasingly able to beat Turing tests and the likes, it's increasingly important to be able to verify whether someone online is a person or a bot. So, lest we head towards a vindication of the dead internet theory , we also need increasingly more accurate methods for distinguishing neurons from silicon. This is no less true for gaming than anywhere else. Players using bots to cheat in online games is a real problem , and as AI gets more sophisticated, we can only assume the problem will get worse. Anti-cheats tackle this issue from one angle—checking program executables and so on—but another way of tackling it is to check that a user is a live person, a method that is often called 'liveness detection' or 'proof-of-human'. I've spent the last week or so speaking to various expert humans and industry insiders to see what the state of play is for proof-of-human tech in gaming, and whether these technologies might pose an…",

Examples include MS-DOS and GW-BASIC , and now another blast from the past has been added to the collection. Somewhat surprisingly, though, this one is really old and just so happens to be a version of its first-ever software product. Specifically, it's a port of BASIC, the OS that founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen developed for use on the Intel 8080-powered Altair 8800 . As explained in a Microsoft blog , the version that's just been released on GitHub was created for computers using MOS Technology 6502 processors (via The Register ). The Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 were both 8-bit CPUs, launched in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Although the latter was less capable than the former, it was considerably cheaper, which is why Acorn Computers, Apple, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and many others bought it in droves to power their computers and consoles. Such was the popularity of the 6502 that Gates and Ric Weiland wrote a port of BASIC specifically for that processor, which Commodore paid a flat license fee to use on its PET computer (then i…",

This is exactly what's happened with an Indiana-based lawyer called Mark S. Zuckerberg, as reported by TechCrunch . Sharing a near-identical name with Meta's CEO might seem to be a relatively innocuous thing, as does the fact that the aforementioned lawyer has been legitimately using Facebook to advertise his legal services. However, as explained in a short report from WHTR, Meta's moderation systems have apparently flagged such Facebook posts as being a false impersonation of the other Zuckerberg and promptly taken them down. The lawyer has, of course, paid fees for using a commercial Facebook page, but you never get them back if a post is removed. This has apparently been going on for so long that Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta for breach of contract and other aspects.

    "body": "Three months after Disney and Universal sued AI image generator Midjourney for copyright infringement, Warner Bros Discovery has joined the fight. The media giant has launched its own lawsuit against Midjourney, accusing it of \"brazenly dispens[ing] Warner Bros Discovery's intellectual property as if it were its own.\" Midjourney is a generative AI service that produces images based on text prompts: Tell it what you want and it'll spit something out. The problem, as we noted when Disney and Universal filed their suit in June, is that there are no copyright guardrails. Midjourney is happy to churn out images that are direct lifts of copyrighted material—like this one, for instance, is clearly Woody from Toy Story, even though Midjourney has absolutely no legal right to be producing images of Woody from Toy Story. (Image credit: Disney (via reinhardt2016/Midjourney)) \"Midjourney could easily stop its theft and exploitation of Warner Bros Discovery's intellectual property,\" the lawsuit (via Culture Crave ) states. Instead, it alleges, \"Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breath…",

    "body": "When it comes to messy videogame launches, MindsEye has certainly been a hot contender. The first third-party game to be published under Hitman developer IO Interactive's Partners programme, its debut has been rather sour—poor sales, a Mostly Negative rating on Steam, and layoffs at developer Build a Rocket Boy. That's not to mention the bizarre accusations being flung around from its co-CEOs. Former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies blamed the game's failure on \" internal and external saboteurs, \" a sentiment that had been echoed by Mark Gerhard just a couple of months prior when he popped off on Discord to claim that the negative reactions to the game were \"100%\" financed by someone . A mystery someone. It's enough of a palaver to make anyone wary of trying again, and IOI CEO Hakan Abrak certainly seems apprehensive to re-enter the lion's den. During a recent interview with IGN , Abrak reflected on the initial response to MindsEye: \"It was a tough reception,\" he said. \"It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and …",

Premiering about half an hour before it dropped, as though to keep eager fans company through the last agonising minutes of their wait, Daily Silksong news number 1,693 said goodbye to the cast and crew that have mostly been saying 'no' for the past four plus years, but sometimes yes. After a charming stop-motion vignette in which Ara's friends have to find his bones to turn him back from stone, the host reveals his face for the first time—dressed in a suit to deliver the final bit of news, that Silksong is, in fact, releasing today. \"We finally, finally made it,\" he says, adding that he's been doing this for, in a massive understatement, \"quite a long time. \"Enough time for many things in one's life to change—and a lot of things have changed in my life during that time. I remember watching the original Silksong trailer, right as it dropped, at work on my phone. \"Some three years later,…",

Politicians, CEOs, and even Tim Sweeney are not happy about what is being perceived as just \"a slap on the wrist\" for its illegalities. As noted by the Guardian , Barry Lynn, the executive director of the Open Market Institute thinktank, says, “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.” Nidhi Hedge, the executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project , argues, \"You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot… Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolisation and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly.
