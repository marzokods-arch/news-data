There's a very recognisable and jolly silhouette on the horizon. It's Resident Evil 8's Lady Dimitrescu, whose actor Maggie Robertson will be your glamorous host for the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards. The big day is this Thursday, November 20 at 8am PST / 11am EST / 4pm GMT / 5pm CEST , when the show will reveal its 26 winners in a gala ceremony going out across YouTube , Twitch , Steam , Facebook , TikTok and X as well as Future Games Show , GamesRadar , PC Gamer , WhatCulture Gaming , Ginx TV , Bilibili and Niconico. In other words, it's everywhere. You could probably have it telegrammed to you live if you insisted on it. After 43 years in the awards biz, this year's Golden Joysticks hit a new record in terms of votes cast. Over 21 million people made their voices heard when it comes to the ceremony's many categories. Can 21 million people be wrong? Well, it depends on whether they gave GOTY to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 or not. Maggie Robertson isn't the only star studded in this year's cast. 2025's Golden Joysticks guest prese…",

This week I've been: trying to survive the Raider and Arc packed perils of Stella Montis. I love shouting \"Don't shoot\" in Stella Montis in solo—it's like Raider radar. You'll hear one person reply from the balcony above you, another from the next room over, one in a nearby vent, and a final one you didn't even realise was standing behind a pillar nearby. Arc Raiders ' new Stella Montis map is cramped , especially after the big sprawling open areas of Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Blue Gate that we've grown accustomed to since launch. That's partly what makes it so distinct, though. Stella Montis's confined corridors and snaking tunnels, packed to the gills with Arc enemies and other Raiders, make for a unique brand of chaos. It's a space for players who love the excitement of interaction and conflict. Loading into the map as soon as it opened at the end of last week was everything I'd hoped for raiding a mysterious old world facility.

Arc Raiders Matriarch spawn locations Image 1 of 2 Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 Spaceport (Image credit: Embark) Like the Queen during the Harvester event, you'll only encounter the Matriarch during the Matriarch event map condition . You'll know when this is active, as you'll see the modifier before picking a map on the main menu, and again when you load into the match. It's worth noting that the Matriarch event spawns on normal map nodes, not a separate node like the Night Raids and Electromagnetic Storm. Once you're in the match with the event active, you'll need to search the following location for the Matriarch, depending on the map: Dam Battlegrounds: The Breach area of the dam, …",

This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\". Ingold revealed the full story in an interview with Eurogamer , explaining how Inkle was approached by multiple organisations about working with their licenses following the success of 80 Days . \"One of those was an approach from the BBC, who floated several different BBC properties for us to consider working on. As a lifetime Doctor Who fan, that was the one we jumped on.\" Inkle then spent roughly eight months working on a pitch called The Daedalus Ef…",

There's not a person who'd be more qualified to build and run a game company.\" Musk's videogame credentials largely amount to liking videogames. He might actually be quite good at Quake and Diablo 4 , too, though it's really hard to tell given his penchant for paying people to play for him. In January, he streamed some Path of Exile 2, but seemed confused by basic game mechanics, which would have been fine if he hadn't been boasting about his skills, or if he wasn't playing on a geared-up, high-level character.

I received the View 390 Air in its white variant for review. This being called 'Snow' and offering a suitably frosty finish across most parts of the case. Though there are a few colourways to choose from, including a delectable-sounding Butter Caramel (yellow) and, my personal favourite, Future Dusk (purple). Or just plain black if you're a bit boring. Upon opening the box, I had a feeling I might end up a little disappointed with the View 390 Air. The case doesn't make a good first impression, in large part thanks to the bag of loose screws hanging in the rear. This, I dare say, is the messiest bag of bolts ever called 'accessories' I've experienced with a PC case—a jangling selection of screws, zip-ties, and a roll of Velcro, looking like the world's worst party favour.

It first caught my eye as it is a pink, epic rarity item, but I hadn't paid it any more attention until I saw just how effective it is against arcs. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Over the last few days, I've seen videos of this mine one-shot a Bastion , kill a Leaper, and be integral in the fight against the Queen arc. It's truly the best item in the game right now for killing arcs. YouTuber Damood brought eight Deadline mines to his fight against the Queen arc and, alongside the help of other raiders and the electromagnetic cloak, managed to use them to take the Queen down in under 10 minutes, an impressive feat. While another player, LifelessOne, decided to see what would happen if they put a Deadline on a Leaper: \"The new mine is… strong.\" I'm just impressed they ma…",

However, the days of this vastly preferable third option may be numbered. US states Wisconsin and Michigan have already proposed VPN crackdown bills aiming to close off this workaround—and the UK may be looking to follow suit . Online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently criticised this strategy, taking aim at Wisconsin's bill in particular, saying that blocking the use of VPNs is \"going to be a disaster for everyone.\" The foundation argues that due to lawmakers misunderstanding how the location-masking technology works, \"Websites subject to this proposed law are left with this choice: either cease operation in Wisconsin, or block all VPN users, everywhere, just to avoid legal liability in the state. One state's terrible law is attempting to break VPN access for the entire internet.\" The EFF then goes on to explain that, …",

Navok reckons that, for as much as people like me bang on about AI being the labour-sucking death of art, \"it appears consumers generally do not care\" when the tech manifests in their games. To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

    "body": "Game developer Rebecca Heineman has died after being diagnosed with cancer last month. The news was shared to Bluesky by Heineman's friend, Heidi McDonald , while the most recent post on Heineman's GoFundMe is a goodbye message stating that her health was rapidly deteriorating, and she was entering palliative care. Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements. Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames . Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate. Heineman's friend and colleague from Interplay, Brian Fargo, shared a remembrance of the developer on X. \"Rebecca Heineman sadly passed a…",

Part of its appeal lies in the oppressive, stressful music and sound design by composer Remu Daifuku : This game has the worst, most disconcerting collection of gurgles, slurps, crunches, screeches, creaky floorboards, and haunting biwa string solos I ever done heard. I love it so much. Demon King producer Andy Han got me in touch with Daifuku so I could find out how you make a game that sounds like literal hell. The answer, it seems, is some incredibly creative (and occasionally painful) sample work. \"Making the sounds was basically just layering, spectrally morphing and manipulating samples until I found something I thought sounded cool,\" Daifuku said. \"Most of the sounds I made were simply happy accidents, such as the Nure-onna gasping before she feeds, which was me accidentally eating very stale banana chips.\" Unfortunately, the exact scene Daifuku is referencing is not on YouTube, but I'm pretty sure you can hear the gasp in question (followed by some stomach-churning slurping) at the 57-second mark of this trailer for Labyrinth of the Demon King. \"I thought…",

The Arc of Arc Raiders deliver on all of these treasured pastimes, and never has there been a better example of their unpredictable, physics-powered behavior than watching the extraction shooter's alpha predator, the Queen, get absolutely suplexed by a rocket returning home. It's a sight that I would not have believed if the footage didn't exist. You must see it for yourself, as documented by blessed witness ExpertCatJuggler on Reddit. The circumstances couldn't be simpler, nor more perfect: A Queen is roaming the abandoned fields of the Spaceport when it happens to crawl over an Arc Probe, a type of loot cache that lands in random spots on maps and then rockets back home after a while. I would have guessed that in the battle between Queen and a puny probe rocket, the 600-ton monster would prevail, but the probe proves an unstoppable force. arcraiders from r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oz3a0r/queen_gets_fucking_suplexed_by_probe What I love most about the i…",

And it is, without a doubt, the most French set of TGA nominations to date. If you've been involved in any conversation this year about JRPGs, turn-based combat, dev studio sizes, parrying, or the profound absurdity of French culture, it should come as no surprise that Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is TGA 2025's most-nominated game. Including its Game of the Year nomination, Clair Obscur is in contention for 10 awards—three more than Death Stranding 2. (Image credit: Kepler Interactive) And you know how much they love Kojima over at Geoff's house, so that's saying a lot. While Clair Obscur might be boasting the most nominations, it'll still have to outvote the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and the sheer cultural force of Hollow Knight: Silksong. If I know anything about Silksong fans, it's their ability to channel manic energy into a website. If you want to weigh in for the TGAs yourself before the show …",

Joseph O'Connor, now 26 years old, hijacked over 130 accounts, including those of Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Kanye West. Alongside other hackers, three of whom have been charged, they then impersonated the companies / individuals in question and used the accounts to promote a classic \"double your money\" scam. The hijacked accounts would send tweets asking followers to send Bitcoin to digital wallets, promising that the money would be doubled and returned. An estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed these dodgy tweets and, over 15-16 July 2020, a total of 426 transfers totalling 12.86 Bitcoin was made to the wallets. This would have been worth around $110,000 in 2020: now the value would be more like $1.2 million. The hack itself, as they often are, was more down to social engineering than cyber genius.

Microsoft's four-pronged attack on cheating has two points you'll likely already be familiar with. The first is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which many of you will recognise from the whole Windows 11 unsupported machine upgrade fiasco . The second is Secure Boot, which you may also recognise from the Battlefield 6, err, fiasco , as it needs to be properly enabled on your machine before you can play the game. The third is Virtualization-based Security (VBS), which is used to keep vital parts of Windows (like the kernel) in an isolated environment.
