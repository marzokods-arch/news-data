Try as he might, Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone can't stay away from the farm life for very long, and I can't say that I blame him. He's also tried to set expectations and doesn't want to stir \"too much hype\" before the timing is right, but that's just not possible. The people yearn for the farms, and it's sounding like 1.7 will be another big update . Between new farm types, flourishing romance, and whatever other 'social' changes entail, there's a lot to take stock of and speculate on, so here's everything we know about the Stardew Valley 1.7 update. Is there a Stardew Valley 1.7 release date? There's no release date for the Stardew Valley 1.7 update yet. Big updates for Stardew Valley are typically years apart, and though it feels like we just got the last major patch yesterday, version 1.6 launched in March 2024. In my defense, those extra 1.6x updates just kept coming. Barone revealed his plans for another patch last year during the Stardew Valley Symphony of Seasons tour and followe…",

I bring this up because Botany Manor sounds very much like my kind of puzzle game—lots going on, but not too intellectually taxing—and it's free right now on the Epic Games Store . Botany Manor is a cozy first-person puzzle game that casts players as botanist Arabella Greene, who despite her apparent retirement is exploring a Victorian manor in the late 19th century in order to complete her botanical research book. It's got a little bit of a Witness vibe, maybe some Blue Prince , but unlike those games (neither of which I came close to finishing) the goal in this one isn't to make you feel bad for not being smart. \"We have put a lot of thought into this game because it has a very nice peaceful setting,\" lead developer Laure De May told us in 2024 , just ahead of Bo…",

Oh, and they can explode, making them a risk when left next to your bed or in an unmanned part of a plane, so that's not ideal. Luckily, a new breakthrough means we may be able to move on from them. Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

Nitrogen's ESXi ransomware, as spotted by Coveware (via The Register ), has a \"coding mistake in the ESXi malware [that] causes it to encrypt all the files with the wrong public key, irrevocably corrupting them.\" Effectively, once ransomware gets into your device (often via suspicious links or PC vulnerabilities), it then encrypts your valuable files and stores a randomly generated key that only it knows. That key can then be used to decrypt files. It's like someone who spots you removing your lock from a locker and putting theirs on instead. Thus, affected users are forced to fork out cash to bad actors on the chance they can actually get the files back. Coveware points out that when the public key is accessed, the ransomware mistakenly overwrites the first four bytes of the key, which means \"no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"…",

For example, I only got three skill points when I reset last time, but instead of $2 million, I now only have to pay $600k for the remaining two. In fact, $2 million would get me those old skill points and two of the second Expedition ones as well. While I think the old system was fine, it definitely makes those bonuses easier to claim for everyone involved, which is a good thing when we're taking the time to complete the project and offer up our loot-filled stashes. You'll also get the outfit, the stacking consecutive bonuses, and the permanent upgrade to free stash space, making the prestige mechanic pretty lucrative as it stands. Also, it can be fun and refreshing to start…",

Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows. As of yesterday's Steam (and Steam Deck) client beta update , Valve has put paid to a bug that meant the platform would sometimes forget it can run Windows games on Linux.

The bug in question afflicted users with especially large libraries—though Valve doesn't say how large—and would \"result in Proton games showing up as 'Not valid on current platform'\".

This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates.

Rather than always ripping and tearing with wild abandon, you were always dodging and pirouetting with forced necessity. What happened to being knee deep in the dead? In Eternal, you were always soaring over them. Therefore, when id Software recalibrated the rebooted series with Doom: The Dark Ages , moving back towards gameplay that prioritised getting stuck into the demonic hordes rather than constantly running away from them, I was overjoyed.

The stated reason for these delays will be fairly obvious for those of you keeping up with the situation in PC gaming hardware at the moment. Yes, it's the ongoing memory shortage that's said to be to blame, as DRAM module supply is being hoovered up by AI servers, with little left over for the consumer market. While small amounts of hope held out for a Super refresh of Nvidia's 50-series cards at some point this year, the new offerings would still need a substantial dose of VRAM. Rumours last year suggested that the refresh would involve an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super and potentially a 24 GB RTX 5080 variant, with the former making use of multiple 3 GB GDDR7 modules.

Aside from The Last of Us, Mazin is known for HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, as well as a handful of comedy films, including a couple of the Scary Movie parodies and the second two Hangover movies. According to Deadline, the Baldur's Gate show will feature new and existing characters and draw its world primarily from Baldur's Gate 3.

    "body": "Puzzling out how to change appearance in Nioh 3 is likely one of the first things you'll wonder how to do, especially if, in typical Soulslike fashion, you either regret the monstrosity you've created, or they somehow don't look anything like they did in the character creator. I swear, I spend 30 minutes designing a character and someone completely different wanders out. Since Nioh 3 has a character code system, you can share your character creations with others, or yoink the very pretty ones strangers have spent hours handcrafting—all you need is a code. Below I'll explain how to change appearance and also use and share these character codes in case you want something premade. How to change appearance in Nioh 3 You can change your appearance in the Eternal Rift after you defeat Jakotsu-baba (Image credit: Koei Tecmo) To change your appearance in Nioh 3, you first have to beat the Jakotsu-baba boss in the Hamamatsu Castle Crucible, which will unlock the Eternal Rift hub area. Once unlocked, you should: Fast travel to the Eternal Rift Head upstairs in the building on your left Continue into the room past Saito Fuku Look for the mirror on top of a box with a cushion in front of it I…",

    "body": "Compared to every other soulslike I've played, Nioh 3 really just throws loot at you, Diablo-style. It's not so much about finding a rare, one-of-a-kind sword or helmet in a cave, so much as it's about hunting for ever-bigger stats on generic gear. In this way, you're encouraged to routinely swap your equipment for something shiny and new. But what you do with all your old, potentially unused gear is vital. You can sell it at a merchant, scrap it at the blacksmith, or use it as an offering at a shrine to get Amrita—souls, for all you FromSoftware knowers. But it's more complicated than it sounds, and it's easy to shortchange yourself. You might've noticed that the gear you use gains 'familiarity' as you kill enemies—it's the little progress bar at the top of the item description. This is crucial because the items you've got high familiarity with are worth much more Amrita when you use them as an offering at a shrine. You can offer gear to a shrine by selecting 'Preparations' and then 'Make an offering'.

    "body": "The Samurai style in Nioh 3 is much closer to the methodical, more hardy, planted sword master that you'd expect from a soulslike, at least compared to the shadowy ninja. However, Nioh 3's samurai has one defining factor that makes it hard to get to grips with for newcomers: Ki Pulse. Ki is effectively your stamina, and you'll soon be breathless if you start flailing around as the samurai. So much so that I barely used the warrior early on in favour of the ninja, where I simply overwhelmed the enemy with a flurry of attacks and dodged here, there, and everywhere. The Ki Pulse is how samurai manage their stamina, requiring you to press the right bumper on a controller at the correct time during combos to recover Ki. It's a lot to keep track of, and it doesn't lead to very smooth, impactful samurai combat if you can't do it right. Plus, I'm a sucker for odachis—large, Ki-eating swords—so I was burning through stamina after just a few hits, leaving me defenceless. One early item that really helped me is the Running Water skill , which lets you perform a Ki Pulse by dodging. It's as simple as it sounds, but it's another way to get your stamina back after a combo while also evading att…",

As is typical for the first real boss in any soulslike, Jakotsu-baba is no walk in the park, as I'm sure you've figured out by now. Not only is Jakotsu-baba a real pain by himself, but he's also inside the Crucible—basically a nightmare realm, where any damage you take also decreases your maximum health. What's already a hard fight is now a true test of skill, as every hit you take sets you even further back. But don't worry, after banging my head against Jakotsu-baba, I figured out a few things that make this fight easier. How to beat Jakotsu-baba in Nioh 3 Jakotsu-baba is a mandatory boss at the end of the Hamamatsu Castle Crucible, so you need to beat them to continue the story and progress into later zones.

So, Embark is doing things a little differently for its second Expedition project that departs on March 1. \"Starting off, we want to get one announcement out of the way right off the bat: we’ve heard your feedback about the required Stash value for maximum rewards being too high, and have decided to lower the requirement to three million Coins (600k per Skill Point),\" Embark wrote in blog post published today. \"The reward will still be five skill points for reaching the three million stash value.\" That's a big discount from the five million Coins that were needed to get the full skill point bonuses in the first Expedition—or a million coins per point.
