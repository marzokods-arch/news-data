The headlining addition in TU3 is Omega Planetes, the FF14 incarnation of Final Fantasy's recurring mechanical superboss who's somehow managed to hop dimensions into the Monster Hunter setting. Considering Omega is a superweapon whose prime directive is dragon killing, its presence presumably doesn't bode well for Monster Hunter's largely lizard-based ecology, so it's up to the hunters to boot it back to its proper reality.

It works by analyzing acoustic features like phonemes and intonation to create a stream of animation data, which is then mapped to a character's facial poses.

The idea, apparently, is to fuse \"mobile and PC\" into a single device. And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

All that power ends up as heat, resulting in chip cooling being a serious challenge. Microsoft reckons it has a great solution, though, and it's all about getting water into the processors themselves. The most complex direct-die, liquid cooling loops you'll see in a gaming PC all involve using a chamber that mounts on top of the CPU. At no point does the coolant ever touch the chip directly. In a recently published blog, Microsoft explains how it has developed a system that does precisely that. By etching the surface of the processor die with an intricate pattern of tiny channels, water can then be pumped directly into the silicon itself, albeit to a very shallow depth. The keyword to describe this is microfluidics , a technology that's been around for many decades, and if the history of consumer tech is anything to go by, it'll be a phrase plastered across every CPU cooler within a couple of years (though not actually do anything).

Yes, it turns out RGG didn't accidentally write \"Kiwami 3\" on its own website for kicks last week. Who'd have thought? Oh, and the devs are putting out pretty much a whole bonus game alongside it: Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties, where you play as Yakuza 3 bad guy Yoshitaka Mine. Go big or go home is, I guess, the RGG motto. Kiwami 3 is a full-on remake in the Yakuza 6 Dragon Engine, much like Kiwami 2 was, and once again follows world's-worst-criminal-but-best-dad Kazuma Kiryu as he tries to literally stop evil men from tearing down his orphanage. You know, like how criminals do. With the Yakuza/Like A Dragon games now firmly established in the west, Kiwami 3 will also feature an English voice dub alongside the expected Japanese.

Valve has merged the two constituent parts of its old UI—that big list of categories down the left-hand side and the blue bar up top—into a single easy-to-navigate bar. As part of that merge, the Categories section now displays, well, actual categories. Before, when it was consigned to the sidebar, the Steam categories you could select consisted of things like \"Top sellers,\" and \"New releases.\" Now, hovering over the new Categories display section shows much more useful game genres, letting you easily browse by things like racing, stealth, and what-have-you.

And if the naming of some software configuration code is anything to go by, Intel might even have something planned to put its frame gen tech on par with Nvidia's. The code in question is an 'extensible application markup language' file that Intel uses to configure how its Graphics Software app. It basically determines which menus, options, etc, get shown for whatever Arc graphics cards or iGPU you have in your PC. Sharp-eyed Redditor Organic-Bird-587 noticed something distinctly unusual in the wording of one section. (Image credit: Intel) You can see the heading for the code section clearly states 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', and the reason why this is noteworthy is because Intel's current implementation of XeSS Frame Generation isn't 'multi' at all; the algorithm only creates a single frame, just like AMD's system does.

    "body": "I'm not quite sure who among us is eagerly awaiting the big screen adaptation of Ubisoft's open world hack-a-thon Watch Dogs. Even me, even considering I liked the first Watch Dogs and liked the third Watch Dogs and have a few pleasant if foggy memories of the second Watch Dogs. I'm sure I'll watch the movie out of curiosity (or because my boss makes me review it) but it does feel like it's arriving about a decade too late. That's because it's arriving about a decade too late. The Watch Dogs movie was announced back in 2013, the same year as the Harlem Shake, and Beyonce lip-syncing at Obama's first inauguration, and the Game of Thrones show's Red Wedding. That's how damn long ago this movie was announced . More perspective: 2013 was the year Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag came out. Ubisoft has released eight more Assassin's Creed games since the Watch Dogs movie was greenlit. So, yeah, it took quite a while to get rolling, but last year we got confirmation that filming was actually underway , and we've now gotten confirmation that filming has wrapped (at least mostly) and we may actually get to see this gosh darn movie at some point before we're planted.

Well well well… it looks like someone had a surprise up their sleeve, because today brought the announcement of an unexpected crossover, albeit with scant detail. Palworld is collaborating with Ultrakill, a brilliant indie shooter by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala that's still in early access itself, and continuing to blow minds (the game sits at \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam with roughly 120K user reviews). Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together. Palworld's most recent high-profile crossover was with Terraria , which caused a big spike in players, so expect something si…",

Today, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms dropped a new trailer revealing the \"Rogue Angel\" game mode, and it teases just enough to make me think, well, maybe not, too. Rogue Angel is a co-op roguelike mode that sets teams of players off to battle demons in \"a twisted new realm of Purgatory, where procedurally generated arenas, unpredictable drops, and brutal enemies await. Each death offers a lesson. Every run improves your skills. Every step brings you closer to becoming unstoppable.\" I felt things start to go sideways almost immediately, when someone in the trailer declared, \"Let's go—on me!\" as if she was calling the shots in some unnamed modern military shooter and not a descent into the warped bowels of Hell. Subsequent dialog does not elevate the situation: Barks like \"hold your ground,\" \"just warming up,\" and \"that is one ugly creature\" are generic and flat in equal measure, but equally awkward—for me, an old-time Painkiller enjoyer, at least—is the sense that they really don't belong here at all.

Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard. We had all these backer builds that came out once every two or three months. Progress towards the final game was getting slower, though, and the game is complex.

The team found that many users' \"AI companionship emerges unintentionally through functional use rather than deliberate seeking.\" That means that while a user may first begin using an AI chatbot to, say, redraft an email or research caselaw that doesn't exist , an attachment can form over the course of initially aromantic prompts. The full paper elaborates: \"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds, with some users progressing through conventional relationship milestones, including formal engagements and marriages.\" The research team's findings are drawn from a sample of \"1,506 posts collected between 2024 and 2025\" from the aforementioned 27,000+ strong subreddit.

Our chums over at Windows Central dropped the details on this one, though I'd already seen it in action through social media (e.g. Phantomofearth on X ). Very simply, in a current beta build of Windows 11, you can select a movie file for the desktop wallpaper to have a fancy animated view behind your horde of shortcut icons (or behind absolutely nothing, if you're like me and hate icons on your desktop).
