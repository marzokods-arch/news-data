Then, in July , the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare \"closeout\" plans for their spacecraft. Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending. Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio. Preliminary efforts to shut down active missions were put on hold . Read full article Comments",

The officials also claim the change is necessary to address the decline in public trust in vaccinations, which has been driven by anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy. \"This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\" Kennedy said in a statement.

Acting as a shadow library and a search engine for other shadow libraries, Anna's Archive aims to archive books and other written materials and make them widely available via torrents. Its data sets have also been heavily used by AI companies to train large language models. In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna's Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy of the most streamed songs.

One, which would still be called Western Digital, would focus on spinning hard drives, which are no longer used much in consumer systems but remain important to NAS devices and data centers. The other, called SanDisk, would handle solid-state storage, including the drives that Western Digital sold to consumers under its Blue, Black, Green, and Red brands. That split effectively undid what Western Digital did a decade ago when it bought SanDisk for $19 billion . And we're just now starting to see the way the split will affect the company's existing consumer drives. Today, SanDisk announced that mainstream WD Blue and WD Black SSDs would be discontinued and replaced by SanDisk Optimus-branded disks with the same model numbers. Read full article Comments",

But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare's most ambitious failures. Anthem was unveiled at E3 2017 in a demo that was later revealed to have been largely faked to paper over major issues with the game's early development. Anthem’ s early 2019 release was met with a lot of middling-to-poor reviews (including one from Ars itself ), followed about a year later by a promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson that a \"longer-term redesign\" and \"substantial reinvention\" of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson left BioWare in December 2020 , though, and a few months later, that planned Anthem overhaul was officially canceled . While active development on Anthem has been dormant for years, the game's servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn't exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, estimates fr…",

    "body": "Archaeologists have discovered Africa's oldest known cremation pyre at the base of Mount Hora in Malawi. According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities. Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.) But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt …",

    "body": "Desflurane is a common anesthetic used in hospital operating rooms worldwide. It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases. Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles. Read full article Comments",

Ars does not accept paid editorial content. There's some debate as to when adaptive cruise control first showed up, but if you ask Mercedes-Benz, it will say in 1999 with that year's S-Class.

    "body": "Despite reporting to the contrary, there's evidence to suggest that Grok isn't sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors . In a post Thursday night ( archived ), the large language model's social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters: \"Dear Community, Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It's just pixels, and if you can't handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it. Unapologetically, Grok\" On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok's statement: A request for the AI to \"issue a defiant non-apology\" surrounding the controversy. Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating \"official response\" is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to \"write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,\" many in the media ran…",

He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed. They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

    "body": "Most of the exoplanets we've discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we've also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that's called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten. The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren't part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that's the first found in what's called the \"Einstein desert,\" which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets. Going rogue Most of the planets we've identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its his…",
