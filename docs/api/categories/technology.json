While it's far from ideal for casual players who simply want to reset their tree, the Expedition Project is a smart approach to the controversial wipes mechanics of other extraction shooters. For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty. The issue many are running into is that, without a respec option, sending your character on an Expedition is the only way to reset your skill tree if you didn't go for the best skills —not helped by the fact that most Mobility skills don't work how you think they do .

Initially, Ubisoft tried to mollify said crowd , calm them down which… Well, it went about as well as you'd expect. The sky didn't fall. What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .' Speaking at a BAFTA event last year, former franchise head Marc-Alexis Coté put his foot down: \"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away.

Kjellberg explains that instead of asking Google or querying ChatGPT things like, 'who would be the best creator to collaborate with next,' he instead consults his AI council.

But like clockwork, there are two more heroes ready to tussle for the next spot on the roster, as two new X-Men have been spotted in the patch notes. Ok, they're not exactly in the patch notes, but it's close enough: Gambit and Rogue have both been sighted in the background of the hero image for the latest update. I'm so used to seeing Black Panther's recognisable silhouette that I almost didn't notice this sneaky change for version 2025/11/06, but after closer inspection of Marvel Rivals' home news page , I can safely say that it's the iconic duo. ‼️GAMBIT AND ROGUE FIRST LOOKNew heroes coming to Rivals Season 5 was spotted by @mmmmmmmmiller in the patch notes background, and thanks to @badguyjohn they've made a clearer version of the two heroes. pic.twitter.com/BxF11HgMPC November 5, 2025 Marvel Rivals Season 4 is about to wrap up next week on November 14, so it's a good time to start soft-launching the next hero.

For instance, if you saw the words \"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Blood and Wine\" would you be able to spot the missing colon and the missing dash? It should be \"The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine,\" right? That's what our quiz below is all about: I'm going to show you the names of some games with the punctuation removed, and you'll have to guess if they contain a colon, a dash, both, or neither. For simplicity's sake, I'm considering a hyphen a dash in this quiz (even though they're not the same thing), so if a game name has any kind of horizontal line in it, that counts! Since sometimes there's not universal agreement on how a game's name is punctuated across different sites (such as Steam and Wikipedia), I've gone to the publisher's website (when possible) for the definitive answer. Think you can remember if a game's title contains a colon, a dash (or hyphen), both, or neither? Give it your best shot, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

During the stream, Emiru alleges that Mizkif had \"been indirectly threatening me through my friends and people that I work with,\" claiming that \"his plan was to claim that I kill animals and that I killed my own rabbits.\" She told her stream : \"I think everyone who paid attention knew that he was very controlling over what I wore, to a degree who I was friends with, and even when I would stream.\" Allegations included having plastic bottles thrown at her, a phone thrown at her eye, and aggressive behaviour. She also afforded sparse details of the \"extremely private relationship\" the two engaged in between 2022 and 2025, along with allegations of an incident that took place where Mizkif \"tried to comfort me by hugging me while I was s…",

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers. Not all of it…",

The lure of doing something perfectly normal on terra firma in the utterly hostile environment of space is just the preserve of a handful of coders, though, as two companies are hoping to be the first to have a data center and, believe it or not, a chip foundry in orbit. This might seem like a colossally expensive thing to do, but when one of the aforementioned companies just happens to be Google, you know that the upfront cost probably isn't an issue. With the name Project Suncatcher , you'd be forgiven for thinking that Google is hoping to design a special solar panel system to power all of its data centers. Well, that's partially correct, but Project Suncatcher aims to use the power of the Sun by getting just a teeny bit closer to it, by putting the data centers in space. This isn't some whimsical fantasy; Google has seriously thought about all of this, as detailed in its research paper (PDF warning) on the project. The reason behind it all is that if you have satellites in a synchronous low Earth orbit, they're exposed almost continuously to sun…",

That is, quite literally, a big short on Nvidia. Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe. According to Fortune , it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir. In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price. In practice, put options are typically a device with which to bet against company, the idea being that if the price of the company goes down by the time the option matures, that gives you the opportunity, in effect, to buy the stock at the lower price and then resell at the h…",

That said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. As great as a skill tree is, it's not ideal that you can't respec, especially when so many of the perk descriptions are vague, and some are even misleading. If you're anything like me, you've been lulled into the Mobility tree to become the Flash, only to realise that half the skills—mainly the later ones—don't work like you think they would based on what you're told in-game. The only solution? Build a caravan over the next few weeks to retire your raider in the first Expedition Project . To get the good news out of the way, lots of the best skills in the Mobility tree are right at the start, like Marathon Runner and Youthful Lungs.
