Players didn't like how currency gain slowed to a crawl (that has since been fixed ) and server woes were widely reported. But one of the enduring complaints about Siege X is that the shift to free-to-play has triggered a huge uptick in cheating. I caught up with Siege creative director Alexander Karpazis at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show last week. I asked if the team at Ubisoft Montreal expected cheating to surge to the extent that it did in June. \"We knew having free access that it could be a vector that is exploited,\" he said, \"and we were ramping up our R6 ShieldGuard. In a lot of ways it really did help, but we need to be faster when it comes to making sure that we stay one step ahead of cheat makers, too.\" Eliminating cheating entirely is impossible, I acknowledged, and Karpazis agreed. \"Absolutely. That's a message that we keep on having to share with our community. It's not something where we'll receive zero percent cheating. \"But there is a goal for us to make sure that, again, if we stay ahead of cheating and we address it fas…",

While working on 2005's Ninja Gaiden Black, he said that Devil May Cry 3 director Hideaki Itsuno—who went on to make DMC 4, 5, and Dragon's Dogma—\"did pretty well for a young guy\" and \"might make something even better next time.\" Behind the blustery facade, Itagaki seemingly respected his action game peers a great deal; roasting them was his way of projecting the image of a true Master Ninja. But as I tried to convey in my Ninja Gaiden 4 review , Itagaki's games were different from the ones his competitors were making. It wasn't just that they tended to be more challenging, but that they took themselves so seriously; the winking tone that Kamiya favored with DMC's Dante and later Bayonetta were nowhere to be found in Itagaki's games. His sense of humor was adding an easier \"Ninja Dog\" mode to Ninja Gaiden for players who died too many times on the first level. The most cosmically strange thing about Ninja Gaiden 4…",

On a Battlefield subreddit thread that's already amassed 11,000 upvotes and thousands of comments, folks are blasting a particular kin spotted in an early build of Season 1, which begins October 18. \"Wicked Grin\" is a variant of a default NATO assault outfit with a bright blue camo pattern. Its in-game description suggests it'll be given away as a free store gift. \"'Grounded skins for a while'— 18 days exactly,\" wrote Reddit user Ohforfk. \"Colorful weapons with pictures, colorful camos with neon accents, weird mix of things that are supposed to look cool, but end up simply weird.\" Such is the general tenor of responses in the thread: the lies of EA, doomer talk of Battlefield 6 going all downhill from here, and dunking on the skin itself, which is quite ugly.

Cards Against Humanity purchased the plot of land, located near the border between the US and Mexico, in 2017 to protest (and, one would assume, hinder) the erection of a wall between the two countries. In 2023, a local homeowner noticed that SpaceX was using the site for building materials and heavy equipment and brought it to CAH's attention, after which SpaceX gave CAH a \"12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer\" for the land. Instead, CAH sued. The settlement came shortly before the case went to trial, which was scheduled to happen on November 3. CAH told AP that SpaceX copped to trespassing during the discovery phase, but it opted to settle because a trial \"would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.\" Beyond that, CAH said \"the upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the …",

Samsung looks to have used Apple's product as an example of what not to do, as many of the critiques of the Vision Pro seem fixed—on paper, at least. The pricing, for one. At $1,800, the Galaxy XR is still a bit of a teeth-clencher, but it's still nearly half the price of Apple's initial offering.

There's no source given for these charts, but it tracks with other analysis and even consumer tracking such as on pcpartpicker.com , and Wang is a reliable industry analyst. The AI boom (or bubble) has most certainly played a big part in this, because AI datacentres require tons of DRAM for stacks of high bandwidth memory (HBM). And while DDR5 memory offers the latest and greatest on this front, much of this will be spoken for by big customers, leading many to fall back to DDR4, creating more demand and causing this price rise. This will have combined with declining DDR4 production as DRAM manufacturers transition more heavily towards DDR5, resulting in tons of demand and less supply. Thus, higher prices.

Battlefield 6's maps have been controversial since the very beginning, to say the least. Of its launch offerings, I think Siege of Cairo is fantastic (as is the returning Operation Firestorm), and I'm open to Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak, and even New Sobek City when people aren't abusing the rooftops. But other than Cairo, I wouldn't say any of these arenas are all that memorable or iconic. If you've instead been waiting for more of the large-scale warfare that the series is traditionally known for, then Season 1 will be a salve. Already, we're getting two large maps in Blackwell Fields and Eastwood. Both maps support ground and air vehicles, though only Blackwell Fields features jets. Bla…",

Supports in Battlefield 6 can fully revive teammates with a charged defib hit and can also dish out regular ammo refills, making them the most self-efficient and reliable class to play. (Image credit: EA) Over the last few weeks we've seen plenty of medics jump into the line of fire to save comrades in arms, but one has managed to stand head and shoulders above the rest. ThatFriendlyGuyTTV shared the impressive news of reaching 1,000,000 score with just eight kills, a 0.006 K/D, and a mighty 5,077 revives: \"Pacifist Battlefield completed.\" 5,077 revives is certainly an impressive achievement for any army medic, but I do take issue with the eight deaths.

Simply back it down towards a lower setting.
