New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",

Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.

The video shows that Gemini on Google Home is unable to accomplish a variety of commands, while the Android version handles things just fine. This strongly suggests that you should hold off on upgrading to Gemini on your smart speaker or smart display. Google finally brought Gemini to Google Home and Nest users , allowing smart speaker and smart display owners to get in on the action. Unfortunately, many users have complained that Gemini struggles with basic features compared to Assistant on these devices. But just how bad is it? Well, a new YouTube video paints an extremely ugly picture. YouTuber Adam Hrivnacky posted a video (via Reddit ) comparing Gemini on his Android phone to the chatbot on his Google Nest Hub. The clip, seen above, reveals a major quality gap between the two platforms.",

Instead of launching the Google app, as it does on other Android devices, tapping the search bar on Pixel phones has traditionally opened a unique search overlay that also enables searching for apps, local files, and contacts, and offers a shortcut to search the web in a relatively modern interface. Unfortunately, if you liked that interface, you’d be disheartened to know it is going away. Instead of the unique interface, Google is replacing it with the search screen we’re used to seeing on other non-Pixel devices.",

The Opportunities in Research, Business, Innovation, and Technology (ORBIT) challenge is a multi-phase innovation competition designed to empower university and college students to develop next-generation solutions that benefit life on Earth and deep-space exploration. With up to $380,000 in total prize funding, NASA’s ORBIT challenges student teams to bring their most forward-thinking concepts to the table, either utilizing NASA intellectual property or conceptualizing their own. Teams are tasked with conducting targeted research, designing early mockups or models, and performing feasibility analyses to refine their ideas. Finalists then advance to a live showcase where they present their work to a panel of expert judges, who evaluate the proposals and select winners based on the teams&#8217; final pitches and responses to questions. The ORBIT has two challenge tracks for teams to choose from. The ORBIT Earth track requires teams to select a NASA-owned patent and develop novel commercial or nonprofit applications addressing real-world problems. …",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We spotted that Google is testing a less intrusive placement for the Remix button in Google Messages after user complaints. The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

There’s no getting around the fact that you are feeding an immense amount of deeply personal information, from journal entries to sensitive work emails, into a black box owned by trillion-dollar corporations. What could go wrong? Now, there’s no going back from AI, but there are use cases for it where it can work as a productivity multiplier. And that’s why I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of researching local AI . If you’re not familiar with the concept, it’s actually fairly simple. It is entirely possible to run a large language model, the brains behind a tool like ChatGPT, right off your computer or even a phone. Of course, it won’t be as capable or all-knowing as ChatGPT, but depending on your use case, it might still be effective enough.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Ookla data shows Verizon delivered the fastest mobile download speeds at many major US airports. Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

While the issue remains unexplained, some people point to possible HDR format incompatibility. While iOS 26.2 doesn’t fix it, some folks have also figured out a fix Apple has long attempted to keep Android and related services out of reach for its users . That friction inadvertently impacts users switching from an Android device to an iPhone or using both OSes at the same time. Now, it appears iOS bugs may also lean into those biases. Several iPhone users noticed an unexplained iOS 26 bug that changes the colors of pictures taken on Android devices and shared with them. Numerous reports on Reddit say that their pictures, when viewed in the iOS Photos app, turn red when they zoom in on the image. The same does not occur while viewing the images on a device running iOS 18.",
