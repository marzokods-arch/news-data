But sometimes, just sometimes, a piece of tech ends up dominating for a long time without anyone coming close to beating what makes it so good. That's been the case for the longest time for the best gaming mouse , and more specifically, the best MMO gaming mouse. Razer's Naga, in many different guises, has historically held the top spot for that particular category. But no longer, as Corsair has broken into our guide with the superlative Scimitar Elite Wireless SE , which is now absolutely the best MMO gaming mouse . Previously, the Razer Naga Pro held the position thanks to its swappable button facias and excellent battery life.

One of the reasons given for the termination was the state of the game. The founders believed that it was ready for an early access launch and planned to go through with it; Krafton, meanwhile, believed it wasn't ready for its debut and that the founders had been shirking their duties . But there's been a surprising U-turn, with Krafton significantly changing its argument. The lawsuit is now in the discovery phase, so Fortis Advisors, which represents the ousted founders, sought discovery to see if Krafton held evidence to back up its claims. \"But despite its obvious relevance, Krafton feigned astonishment during the parties' meet and confers at how it could possibly be part of Phase I,\" Fortis said.

Intel needs a helping hand in a few ways.

The announcement also broke the news of a $5 billion investment by Nvidia into Intel's common stock, at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. According to sources speaking to The New York Times , the Trump administration approached Nvidia in January and asked it to invest in the chipmaker. The US government has since made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel itself, which is now estimated to be worth $13 billion as a result of Intel's share price rising by near 23% off the back of yesterday's news.

Not many folks, that's for sure. Likewise, I should imagine only die-hard Team Red fans at the start of the decade would have predicted that the best choice for a new CPU , regardless of price point or use scenario, would be an AMD processor. And yet, all of the above have come to pass, and in the case of the last point, we've decided it's time to change our recommendation for the best budget gaming CPU. That honour used to go to Intel's Core i5 13400F , but no longer, as AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X is the sensible choice. (Image credit: Future) There's nothing actually wrong with the 13400F, as such, it's just that the 7600X is simply a better option.

    "body": "Our Jeremy said it best when he reported on the surprise announcement of an Intel-Nvidia collaboration yesterday: it's cats living with dogs. Naturally, such a strange occurrence has led people to question just how it will affect current product roadmaps—especially Intel Arc. On that front, thankfully, Intel says things are business as usual. An Intel spokesperson has supplied a statement to the media saying that: \"collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings\" (via PC World and Hot Hardware ). That's pretty unambiguous, at least for the short term. Intel's roadmap, to be clear, currently includes at least two new generations of processor containing its Arc Xe3 iGPUs: Panther Lake and Nova Lake. The former should launch relatively soon, will be mobile (ie, laptop)-only, and will at least in part be made using the company's new 18A node—although early yields apparently aren't looking too promising . The latter will arrive later and should have both desktop and mobile options, just like current-gen Arrow Lake, and looks to be made on TSMC's N2 node. One key bit in the midst of this is that Arc Xe architecture and outside of t…",

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods. (Image credit: Pocketpair / Toasted Shoes / The Pokemon Company) As IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place.
