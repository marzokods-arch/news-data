Dark Souls has plenty of bosses to borrow from and the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is full of weapons that would transform how you approach each run. The beauty of Nightreign is the randomization of the items you find and the bosses you face, so even a slight update could change a lot. These are the things we'd like to see added (and not added) to the game to make the next 300 or so hours even more fun than before. Let me kick Libra to death (Image credit: FromSoftware) Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer : Playing as fist Raider in Deep of Night has really given me an appreciation for how every problem can be solved with punching, but we're still missing some of the best hand-to-hand weapons in Elden Ring.

They've already taken things to the next level of in-game photography, such as placing ziplines for aerial tracking shots, filming actions from multiple angles, and using equipment like smoke bombs for special effects.

But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best. Preloading (or pre-caching) is meant to speed up the load times of File Explorer, which have, so far, been a major downgrade compared to Windows 10. Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process.

He's a sorry sight, mutated beyond recognition with a sapling growing out of his exposed cranial innards, but how he got that way isn't clear. Fans have speculated for years as to whether he's a virus-infected mutant, a radiation-poisoned ghoul, both, or neither, and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has weighed in on the debate with a larger point: any interpretation is right, so long as it's designated as such. He said as much in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel yesterday—the same channel where he routinely shares insights and commentary from his entire body of gamedev work, including everything from the original Fallout to Wildstar and The Outer Worlds. The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't. To summarize, his argument is thus: canon is \"whatever the owner of the IP says it is,\" an individual's interpretation is personal and freeform and therefore \"you can't be wrong,\" and authorial intent is another matter altogether that usually differs from team member to team member, and may even diverge greatly from canon.

As it turns out, those are based on what's referred to as a \"television program\" called South Park. It might not be a videogame, but mercifully for my attention span, it does show brief gameplay of one in its most recent episode: Tolkien is seen playing none other than extraction shooter tour de force Arc Raiders . Eurogamer highlighted a LinkedIn post that shared the story of how it came to be. Embark's marketing lead, Ashley St. Germain, said of the cameo: \"There’s a lot to be thankful for this year, but I don’t know how I’m going to top this week. On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play Arc Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in season 28’s 'Turkey Trot' episode. Like Tolkien, I guess a lot of us just can’t put down Arc Raiders.\" It's not the first time South Park has referenced popular videogames with straight-up footage. The lauded \" Make Love, Not Warcraft \" episode primarily takes place in a Machinima-like rendition of the game itself, and while the show's provocative h…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. When I say Arc Raiders , the first things that probably pop into your mind are arcs and raiding. But a huge part of Embark's hit extraction shooter isn't as action-oriented as any of that. A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside. So to test you on your Arc Raiders trinket knowledge, I've amassed a bunch of in-game items, and will be asking you to rank them from most to least …",
