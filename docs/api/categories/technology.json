    "summary": "It's an incremental update with big implications for the competition.",
    "body": "Credit: Apple TL;DR Apple has announced a new AirTag with a longer Precision Finding range, improved Bluetooth detection, and a much louder built-in speaker. The updated AirTag also adds Precision Finding support on Apple Watch, making it easier to track items without pulling out your phone. Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

    "body": "Detergent bottles and other litter can travel thousands of miles across the ocean before washing up on the remote Island of Kaho’olawe in Hawaii. JPL remote-sensing technology recently showed that it can spot plastic pollution on land, but doing so in the sea presents challenges. NOAA Space-based technology could help track plastic and other flotsam by its ‘fingerprints.’ In late 2025, scientists reported that, for the first time, they were able to detect concentrations of plastic pollution on land using NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor aboard the International Space Station. The technology has inspired marine researchers to see whether it could also help track debris in our waters. Before future generations of sensors like EMIT can be called upon to detect ocean litter, scientists need to know what to look for. Working with collaborators, NASA intern Ashley Ohall has built a newly published reference library containing nearly 25,000 molecular “fingerprints” from all manner of flotsam and jetsam, including rope, tires, metal, bubble wrap, buoys, and bottle caps.

I have a drawer full of Android phones I’ve purchased or reviewed over the years, but they’re all made by the same handful of companies. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartphone industry, with Google and Motorola being the only other brands with significant market share. To be even remotely competitive with these giant players, small phone brands need to think outside the box. That means giving users something the big conglomerates can’t. It could be a niche feature, novelty design, or clever value proposition.",

    "body": "Video Boost has been a staple of the Pixel’s camera experience for two years now, helping us shoot clearer, more stable, better zoomed videos in challenging situations. For me, though, the feature hasn’t always been part of my go-to tricks. I used it a lot when it first launched on the Pixel 8 Pro , then sort of forgot about it, then started using it again last summer. I fell in love with Video Boost again when I used it to catch a few videos during concerts. But for all that I’ve enjoyed about it, I’m just as annoyed by all of its limitations and slowness. I’d love to use Video Boost more on my Pixel 10 Pro XL , but it’s clear that Google is gatekeeping the feature and stopping it from reaching its full potential.",

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

Aggregated trending topic stories are presented very similarly to normal news stories, which may lead readers to blame publishers for misleading or confusing titles. Been seeing bizarre, AI-generated headlines in Google Discover? That’s not an accident, Google says. Following an initial experiment last year , the company has confirmed that it plans to continue using AI to whip up titles for certain stories that appear in the Discover feed that lives on Android home screens, without input from the people who write those stories or much attention paid to whether the generated headlines make any sense. As The Verge ‘s Sean Hollister writes, Google has informed the publication that it will continue slapping AI-generated headlines on certain stories in Discover, a decision that, Google says, has been good for “user satisfaction.”",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR A two-month-old Galaxy S25 Plus exploded while charging in November 2025, and the affected user reports that Samsung has now admitted liability. The company has reportedly agreed to cover the cost of the phone, medical bills, and cleanup, and has offered $500 per person for pain and suffering. We’ve verified the user’s claims, including the report from the local fire department and Samsung’s offer. Samsung has also shared a statement with Android Authority, stating that its analysis concluded that external force was the cause of the incident. Update: January 23, 2025 (1:36 AM ET): Samsung has now shared an amended statement with us, attributing the incident to “external force.” Since the fire department’s investigation concluded that a thermal runaway event occurred, and per the user’s testimony, the phone was simply charging when the incident occurred, it’s unclear what the company means by referring to external force as the cause of the incident. Here’s the full, amended statement Samsung shared with us:",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",
