The loop hits just right (Image credit: 2K Games) Harvey Randall, Staff Writer: I'm about twenty hours in, and as a certified Borderlands sicko who has been playing the games since I was fourteen, I'm having a great time. Borderlands 4's on-ramp is a bit slow, but once you start getting your build online? The loop hits just right. Speaking of loops, I was deeply skeptical of the shift to a full open world, but now that I've properly got my teeth into it I'm a believer. Borderlands' cycle of 'shoot guys, get loot, sell loot, shoot more guys' pairs so devilishly well with this style collectible/objectives hunt that I'm shocked it took this long for Gearbox to make the shift. I keep getting distracted, vanishing down side-quest rabbit holes, saying 'just one more thing, and then I'll get back to the campaign' like Sisyphus planting his feet before shoving that boulde…",

In an update published today to Pocketpair's various social media channels to announce two main things: that it's resolved to put out Palworld's 1.0 version in 2026, and that doing that means there probably won't be any huge updates for the rest of 2025. \"Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access,\" says Pocketpair community director Bucky in the announcement video. \"It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game.

Nearline HDDs are ones used for infrequently accessed data, acting neither as cold (long-term) nor hot (rapidly accessible) storage but something in between. They're primarily used for data such as backups. The AI boom has meant there's more of this storage in demand than before, to keep previous AI training data and model roll-backs, for instance. One recent example of this increased demand comes from Western Digital. The company recently split from its SSD arm, Sandisk, to focus entirely on HDDs. TrendForce relays a notice from the company that was \"spotted by industry sources\" and explains that there is \"unprecedented demand for every capacity in our portfolio.\" Consequently, WD \"will be gradually implementing price increases on all HDD products, effective immediately.\" It will also expand its \"use of ocean freight\", which will increase transport time by a few weeks but \"significantly r…",

It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",
