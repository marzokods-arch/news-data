The company posted 6,955 lines of assembly language code to GitHub under an MIT license, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute the code that helped launch the personal computer revolution. \"Rick Weiland and I (Bill Gates) wrote the 6502 BASIC,\" Gates commented on the Page Table blog in 2010. \"I put the WAIT command in.\" For millions of people in the late 1970s and early 1980s, variations of Microsoft's BASIC interpreter provided their first experience with programming. Users could type simple commands like \"10 PRINT 'HELLO'\" and \"20 GOTO 10\" to create an endless loop of text on their screens, for example—often their first taste of controlling a computer directly. The interpreter translated these human-readable commands into instructions that the processor could execute, one line at a time. Read full article Comments",

    "summary": "Will the new Prelude be the best of both worlds when it goes on sale this fall?",
    "body": "At the end of last year, we learned that Honda was bringing back the Prelude. Although Honda has varied the ingredients over the years, the recipe for the Prelude remains the same: a sleek coupe body and some cutting-edge technology under the skin, like four-wheel steering , as rhapsodized by the verbose but usually insightful motoring writer LJK Setright. Today, the new car broke cover ahead of its arrival in showrooms later this fall. It's a handsome shape, though I can't quite get over the resemblance to the Toyota Prius , at least as far as the nose of the car is concerned. Then again, I'm on record as adoring the shape of the current Prius—did you know its windshield is more steeply raked than a Lamborghini Huracan ? But from other angles, the Prelude is more unique. The proportions are low and wide, with some details that signal its sportiness and others that suggest a focus on reducing drag and maximizing efficiency. That makes sense when you know what's under the hood. It's the same 2.0 L Atkinson cycle engine and hybrid system from the Honda Civic, which, in the right hands, is capable of up to 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km). We'll know the exact EPA fuel efficiency numbers closer…",

    "body": "We've been covering Philips' lineup of color-changing, Wi-Fi connected Hue lights since their earliest days, and their early success means they became integrated into many smart home setups just as smart thermostats, doorbells, smoke alarms, and speakers were really going mainstream. For anyone embedded in the Hue ecosystem—or anyone who has stayed out because of the accessories' relatively high prices—today's large-scale overhaul of the lineup may be of interest. Philips and parent company Signify are introducing new flagship bulbs, light strips, a new hub, Matter -over-Thread support, and all kinds of other accessories; Hueblog has a comprehensive rundown . For people who have stayed away from the Hue lineup because of high prices, the most important addition to the lineup is the new Hue Essential bulbs. These bulbs can't dim as low as the flagship Hue bulbs and don't support as wide a range of colors or white levels, but the standard A19/E26 versions are available for $25 per bulb individually or as low as $15 a bulb when bought in a four-pack, somewhere between one-half and one-quarter the typical price of a Hue bulb.

Some of SpaceX's most defining moments happened on a piece of beachfront property at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This is where SpaceX first landed a reusable Falcon 9 booster coming back from space and, a few years later, landed two boosters side by side. In all, SpaceX has landed 66 Falcon boosters at Landing Zones 1 and 2 since recovering the first Falcon 9 booster on December 21, 2015 . Now, SpaceX is preparing to hand the landing zones back to the US Space Force, which owns the property and has reallocated the real estate to two startup launch companies.

The model simultaneously generates RGB video and depth information to enable direct 3D reconstruction without the need for traditional modeling techniques. However, it won't be replacing video games anytime soon. The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space. Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting \"several minutes,\" according to Tencent. Objects stay in the same relative positions when the camera moves around them, and the perspective changes correctly as you would expect in a real 3D environment. While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes.

And second, to focus on \"direct-to-surface\" exploration, the White House sought to cancel the Lunar Gateway, a small space station intended to orbit the Moon. Essentially, for long-term sustainability, the White House decided it was best to use lower-cost, commercially available rockets and focus NASA's limited resources on surface activities. For example, the Gateway's $854 million budget in 2024 would be better spent in future years on a lunar base. Read full article Comments",

The size of the persuasion effects shown in \" Call Me A Jerk: Persuading AI to Comply with Objectionable Requests \" suggests that human-style psychological techniques can be surprisingly effective at \"jailbreaking\" some LLMs to operate outside their guardrails.

The first trailer just dropped and the film looks as grimly compelling as its predecessor, while hopefully also retaining something of the 2025 film's heart. (Spoilers for 28 Years Later below.) As previously reported , the critically acclaimed 2002 film 28 Days Later is often credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. In that film, a highly contagious \"Rage Virus\" was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called \"fast zombies.\" Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's system, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society.

The government is getting almost none of that. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest data and behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals.

A District Court judge ruled the same way in July, but Slaughter couldn't get back to work because of an administrative stay that delayed the lower-court ruling from taking effect. The administrative stay was dissolved in yesterday's appeals court ruling, in which a three-judge panel also ruled 2–1 to deny the US government's motion for a longer-term stay pending appeal. \"The government has no likelihood of success on appeal given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent,\" the panel majority said.

There are design cues and links back through Audi's history, but this is no pastiche of a retro design as we might have seen from J Mays. Rather, Audi's design team under Chief Creative Officer Massimo Frascella says that the design influences include one of the pre-war Silver Arrows racing cars, the 1936 Auto Union Type C—Audi being one of the four brands that combined to form Auto Union. The design is deceptively large—bigger than a TT or even an R8. Credit: Aud The Concept C has a targa top—here, it's on. Credit: Audi And here, it's off. Credit: Audi The slats that cover the Concept C's rear bring to mind the cooling louvres at the rear of the Type C, necessary to let the heat generated by its monstrous V16 engine to escape the rear engine bay.

Much of the media coverage has rightly been on how this trend will affect mass-market vehicles . But what does it mean at the high end of the market? \"Well, the first question would be 'Are the Chinese manufacturers really competitive?'\" said Bentley Chairman and CEO Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser in an interview during Monterey Car Week. In the bucolic coastal setting, surrounded by the rarest of rare cars, the competition from the other side of the world appeared far off. \"I don't want to be arrogant, but having what is considered a car in the luxury segment needs more than just technology.
