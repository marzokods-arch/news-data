Such is the case with Battlefield 6: Technical director Christian Buhl told IGN that Ripple Effect ( formerly DICE LA ) \"did not want leaks,\" but it did want as much feedback from players as possible—and that meant rolling the dice. \"We had, actually, discussions, I think about a year or two ago,\" Buhl said. \"I guess it was maybe about two years ago, about how much we were going to do to prevent leaks versus how much we were going to do to get the game in front of players.

By the time the mobile edition of Balatro launched in late 2024, he was \"well and truly burned out.\" \"I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work,\" LocalThunk wrote. \"However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in cru…",

You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real.

Which means a billion guns, gorgeous looks, and some questionable humor. Kotaku has already noticed one joke , however, that seems like a straight-up dig at Embracer Group, former owners of Gearbox. One early game location is called \"Embracer's Bluff\", a run-down place crammed with garbage and containing two rather pointed side quests. The first involves a murderous vending machine that kills a would-be customer, while the second is centred on a talking AI-powered toilet that everyone hates. The cherry on top is the ruler of Embracer's Bluff, who seemingly lives in a hot tub surrounded by dildos. This would be a clear enough dig at Embracer Group, but Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford basically said in the runup to release that Borderlands 4's story was in some ways inspired by the company's acquisition by the Embracer Group, and subsequent r…",
