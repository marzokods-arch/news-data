Most people will probably find The Slab by getting kidnapped in Act 1, but it's possible to get there in Act 2 without losing your stuff. Being a completionist, I intentionally got myself locked up early on to see what the fuss was about, so the advice below is written from that perspective. It won't be as harrowing if you decide to wait until Act 2 though because you can leave at any time. How to find The Slab in Silksong (Image credit: Tyler C. / Team Cherry) The Slab is a somewhat hidden area no matter when you decide to enter it. In Act 1, you can find an armored flea enemy with a cage on the right side of the Deep Docks area.

Asked if he'd be willing to reprise the character in Cyberpunk 2⁠—formerly codenamed Project Orion⁠—Reeves said: \"Absolutely, I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again.\" And that's it, that's all he said on the matter. But it's more than we had previously, and it also raises questions as to how CDPR could continue his story. A very remote possibility is reflecting Cyberpunk 2077 choices through Witcher or Mass Effect-style save importing, but that doesn't feel like a good fit. 2077 was a very personal, self-contained story, one where putting in that effort doesn't particularly feel worth it. That's also before you consider that we likely won't even see Cyberpunk 2 before 2030⁠—10 years after Cyberpunk 2077's release⁠—and that it'd be a pretty crazy ask to cut Keanu Reeves a check for content not all players will see.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like.

And while I personally wonder if the person who put that one bench in the Hunter's March is doing okay and maybe needs to hash some things out with a therapist, I, a certified soulslike freak, am here to tell you that you aren't wrong. Silksong is hard, thorny, and vicious. It's got that classic Dark Souls bite to it: Optional areas that'll stomp you flat, punishing upgrade systems you'll be too poor for if you die a lot, and that one jackass Savage Beastfly whose hurtbox is big enough to have its own postcode. But I'm also here to tell you to stick with it. Having just gotten to Act 2 (I won't be going into spoilers), a lot of those initial problems with the game have basically melted away. But you've got to put in some elbow grease to get there, and I don't just mean in t…",

My point is, once you've decided your non-negotiables—the expensive bits of kit worth your money—what do you do about everything else? Simple: Get creative. One thrifty Reddit user did just that, sharing their DIY PC build featuring both a $60 1080p OLED panel and custom-built housing using Lego-style bricks. Known as Choi, the creator revealed they'd never even touched Lego before attempting the project. They told me that while shopping online, they were looking for something cheap to push the total value of their basket over an amount that would qualify for a discount—and that's when they spotted the bricks. Electing to translate their own answers from Korean into English via ChatGPT, Choi told me, \"Once I received them and started building, I thought, 'This is fun!' That’s when I wanted to try making a PC case with it. I’m not a Lego expert at all—just a beginner who started less than a year ago.\" As such, there was a lot of trial and error. \"I worked on the monitor, keyboard, and main body separately as modules. I don’t remember the exact time, but altogether it took more than a month and a half,\" said Choi. \"I’…",

Whether you're looking at a GPU powerhouse like Nvidia or SSD champions like Micron, everyone is looking to get a piece of the AI pie. One of the latest to the game is Acer, which recently showed off its new mini AI machine at a recent launch event in Germany. Notably though, like other machines we've seen of this ilk, the announcement is all specs and no price or availability. CTEE.com spotted this mini AI workstation from Acer during the company's presentation last week. Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further. Apparently they've packed 128 GB of unified memory, as well as up to 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage into this box that looks about twice the of Mac Mini. Acer boasts that the configuration adds up to deliver up to 1 petaflop of powerful AI compute performance. This is on par with Nvidia's own mini AI PC powerhouse, the DGX Spark.

It requires lithography machines to print and scale these silicon thinking machines. High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet , or High NA EUV, lithography tools are among some of the newest and most cutting-edge methods of making chips. These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made. This new system boasts the ability to print transistors 1.7 times smaller than previous High NA EUV machines. It also delivers 2.9 times the existing transistor densities, providing what SK hynix says is a 40% improvement in the NA …",

This Wednesday the game will get its first major update: The Lost Arsenal , a free, 15-card set of new equipment and rooms. Shiny Shoe shared with PC Gamer exclusively four of the cards appearing in the update, and provided commentary on each of them. Some significant balance changes to existing cards are on the way too, outlined in this post on Steam . I asked the devs some questions about the looming update, as well as what can be learned from Monster Train 2's player data now three months after release. The new cards The Great Decay (Image credit: Shiny Shoe) PC Gamer: This card seems tailor made for Morel Mistress. Are there any other combos that you had in mind while making it?
