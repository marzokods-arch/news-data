I see a lot less of that with Silksong, which PC Gamer reviewer Tyler Colp called the \"videogame equivalent of sticking your hand into the Dune pain box\" in his review (where he also gave it a 90). It's hard—much harder than you'd expect, even if you factor in the metroidvania's reputation for difficulty—and that aspect of it is fielding some mixed reactions . In an interview for a gaming-focused exhibit at Melbourne's ACMI museum spotted by Dexerto , Team Cherry honchos Ari Gibson and William Pellen talked about their perspective on difficulty with an admission that yeah, Silksong's hard, but that's more or less the point. \"Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight—so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent,\" Gibson said. \"[Players] have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled.\" Indeed, Gibson said that while \"some moments of steep difficulty\" may be frustrating, if it…",

However, it sports several details that immediately ring a bell in the context of the announced Intel-Nvidia deal. In today's press release , there was a broad reference to Nvidia's high-bandwidth, low-latency NvLink interface being a critical part of the technological tie-up.
