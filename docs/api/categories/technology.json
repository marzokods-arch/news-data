You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype. For the most part, the evidence in support of an announcement happening today seems to be: Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx on November 18, 2019 Today is also November 18 Half-Life 1 released on November 19, which is also a date in November Half-Life 2 released on November 16, and that, too, is a date in November Geoff Keighley posted a 👀 emoji Don't cancel your dinner plans, in other words.

But, according to Ubisoft, that hasn't stopped the city builder from breaking a few records. Anno 117: Pax Romana is \"the fastest-selling title in the franchise’s 25-year history,\" Ubisoft said in an email to PC Gamer. Ubisoft also said that with an average of 85 on Metacritic (PC Gamer's Anno 117: Pax Romana review scores it an 80) and a 94% \"Recommended\" on OpenCritic (with an average score of 84), Anno 117 has become \"the highest-rated Anno in the franchise's history.\" Steam reviewers haven't been as generous. Amid scattered complaints of bugginess, a shortened campaign, and connection issues with its co-op mode, one user summed it up with the most damning sort of praise a game can get: \"Anno is fine.\" Most of the negative reviews are focused on how unhappy players are that AI assets have been used in the game.

Ouch. Honest mistake, though, and to Valve's credit it offered developer Permadeath a small makeup: an opportunity to spotlight Planet Centauri as one of Steam's Daily Deals, \"as a way to help make up for lost visibility.\" The studio has since moved on to other things, because there really wasn't any choice in the matter, but despite some misgivings it did eventually decide to take Valve up on the offer. So, as reported by Polygon , a little over a month ago Permadeath signed up for the Daily Deal spotlight on one of the dates offered by Valve: November 12. November 12, as it turned out, was a very big day—but not for Planet Centauri. Because November 12 was the day Valve revealed the Steam Machine , Steam Frame , and Steam Controller to the world, a move that completely dominated the videogaming news scene for days and b…",

When Cain says old games, he means old games. We're not talking about his work on the first Fallout here, which is already more than a quarter of a century old. Instead, Cain said we should hearken back to games from the '80s, when he started working in the games industry as a teen. Computer hardware in the '80s was, obviously, less capable. And crucially, Cain said, there were no shared hardware and software standards, even as \"games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles.\" Game…",

It's reached the point where even developer Larian Studios seems a little baffled by the whole thing. A quick recap: Baldur's Gate 3 ran the board on Game of the Year Awards in 2023, taking the big crown (and numerous other laurels) in the Steam Awards, The Game Awards, and the Golden Joysticks. It then continued to rumble in 2024, taking five trophies including Best Game and the Player's Choice awards at the 2024 BAFTAs and four more—including, again, Game of the Year—at the Gayming Awards. It got to the point where Larian boss Swen Vincke was almost asking the world to please stop giving us awards , because the seemingly endless stream of accolades meant the development team \"can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.\" And then a month after that Baldur's Gate 3 won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work, because sure, why not.

The asset in question is a 3D model of plastic explosive that appears in the new trailer. Recognising the asset, McFarlane took to social media to address the issue: \"Hey Delta Force, thank you for being huge Rust fans. Please remove our assets,\" McFarlane posted on X (via Insider Gaming ). \"If you wanted to collab, you should have reached out.\" In a follow-up post, McFarlane linked to an ArtStation page showing the asset, which he says was made \"fully in-house\" by Facepunch's lead weapon and prop artist Thomas Butters, who also goes by Pilgrim. It looks virtually identical to the asset seen in the trailer, though this doesn't necessarily mean it is the same asset.

He's a controversial figure, but Kotick also bought a failing company for $500,000 and turned it into a publisher that Microsoft spent $75.4 billion acquiring. After listening to him suck up to Elon Musk on the Rushmore podcast (cheers TWIV ), however, it sounds like he might have lost his strong instincts. \"Elon truly would be the best owner of any game company,\" he said. \"No, he would. There's not a person who'd be more qualified to build and run a game company.\" Musk's videogame credentials largely amount to liking videogames. He might actually be quite good at Quake and Diablo 4 , too, though it's really hard to tell given his penchant for paying people to play for him. In January, he streamed some Path of Exile 2, but seemed confused by basic game mechanics, which would have been fine if he hadn't been boasting about his skills, or if he wasn't playing on a geared-up, high-level character. It turns out that he used an account boosting service , which he also admitted he did in Diablo 4. The 54-year…",

The Thermaltake View 390 Air swaps a top panel for tempered glass to excellent effect, leaving plenty of options for direct airflow over your components. I received the View 390 Air in its white variant for review. This being called 'Snow' and offering a suitably frosty finish across most parts of the case. Though there are a few colourways to choose from, including a delectable-sounding Butter Caramel (yellow) and, my personal favourite, Future Dusk (purple). Or just plain black if you're a bit boring. Upon opening the box, I had a feeling I might end up a little disappointed with the View 390 Air. The case doesn't make a good first impression, in large part thanks to the bag of loose screws hanging in the rear. This, I dare say, is the messiest bag of bolts ever called 'accessories' I've experienced with a PC case—a jangling selection of screws, zip-ties, and a roll of Velcro, looking like the world's worst party favour.

And they only had 30 employees at the company.\" Kotick didn't want to have to take the reins. \"We can't run your company,\" he told Notch.

There are quite a few items to be had in this event, but the best by far is the Deadline mine.

It's truly the best item in the game right now for killing arcs.
