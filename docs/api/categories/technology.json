Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd. As I write, nearly 200,000 people are playing Borderlands 4 on Steam just hours after it released—on what is for me a Thursday morning. Clearly,…",

Deep of Night isn't endless in the sense that you just keep going day after day until you die, but it is endless in the sense that you rank up or down depending on whether you win a run, and then your progress affects your rank, which you can keep working towards. (Image credit: FromSoftware) It's largely more of the same, with the two-day expedition followed by Nightlord finale, the same maps, and the same kinds of enemies that inhabit them. The main differences lie in how strong these enemies can get and what kind of weapons you can find around the map. Not only do the regular grunts hit harder now, but there are souped-up versions of enemies called mutants with a bloody-red tinge to them. They're yet another step up from what players are used to, but fighting them is worth it because of what they drop: weapons with additional and more powerful effects. I pic…",

I'm not sure what happens when you receive the title back—I like to think trumpets herald a messenger carrying your new, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted plaque—but regardless, Musk has reclaimed the position, despite a year where his Tesla-enhanced fortunes have experienced the odd wobble or two . The Oracle/OpenAI deal is said to be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, which is quite an impressive feat given just how much money is being funneled into AI computing in the metaphorical skies.

As a gamer, I'm used to seeing flashy chairs from the usual suspects, but this was something different enough to grab my attention. And honestly, as someone who's getting on in years and feeling the toll of endless hours at a desk, I'm always on the hunt for anything that might make those marathon computer sessions a little less punishing on my back. Enter the LiberNovo Omni : apparently the world's first dynamic ergonomic chair that promises real-time spine support, motorized lumbar adjustment, four distinct recline positions, and even a built-in spinal stretch massage. The idea of a chair that could actually adapt to how I sit—rather than forcing me into its own mold—was enough to make me take a closer look. But is it the revelation we've been waiting for, or just a flashy Kickstarter moonshot with a few too many moving parts? Unboxing the Omni, I immediately notice its sci-fi vibe. The back support bar looks like it belongs in a spaceship cockpit, and the seat cushion is plush but breathable—think memory foam with a…",

    "summary": "Apple is the king of IPC...",
    "body": "Apple's new A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 was announced yesterday and the first Geekbench scores have been uploaded. To be quite frank, if this was a new x86 CPU for gaming PCs, we'd be losing our minds. The A19 Pro is scoring nearly 4,000 points in Geekbench 6's single-thread test. That compares with about 3,500 for the best AMD desktop CPU . And may I remind you, that's in a freaking phone. The A19 Pro in a desktop with the power budget and thermals that affords would be higher still, well over 4,000. If a new AMD or Intel CPU popped up in Geekbench hitting, say, 4,500, the internet would just about break. And to be clear, these Geekbench numbers for the A19 Pro are plausible. The previous-gen A18 Pro scores around 3,500 points in Geekbench 6. So, a 15% boost to 4,000 points for the latest chip fitted to a phone with a new vapor chamber cooling system doesn't seem like a massive stretch. Of course, Geekbench is hardly the perfect benchmark. And it's demonstrably not a game. But comparative real-world performance in applications doesn't tend to be a million miles away from Geekbench. The bottom line here is that Apple has long had a clear IPC or single-core and per-clock-cycle p…",

We treat everything we receive with an appropriate level of care, of course, but you'd be surprised how often we open up a new machine mere moments after it leaves the box to have a good look at what's going on inside. Where I might draw the line, however, is taking a sharp pair of metal cutting scissors to a brand new gaming handheld like the Nintendo Switch 2 —but then I wouldn't be able to fit a much bigger battery, like this intrepid YouTuber. Join me in saluting the bravado, then, of Naga, who's not only cracked open a Switch 2 on their YouTube channel , but gone at it with a pair of scissors to fit an 8000 mAh battery in place of the regular 5220 mAh unit. As you'd expect, the new battery is physically larger than the old model, both in height and depth, requiring a significant chunk of a thin internal metal frame to be cut away in order to fit it within the plastic chassis. Double points for fitting the weebiest battery possible, too, a bright yellow, anime character-emblazoned model. Anyway, after a handy bit of rewiring (and a quick clean down wi…",

Henry of Skalitz, lovable medieval yokel and protagonist of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (and 1, for that matter), which makes it all the more impressive that the game's recent 1.4 patch snuck in a new secret ending (via GamesRadar ) for those players who manage to single-handedly annihilate an entire enemy army. Uncovered by an industrious Redditor , the new ending can be found in the quest called The Lion's Den. That'd be the one where Henry infiltrates the camp of King Sigismund's army and solves a murder: heavy on sneaking about, investigation, and social skills. Unless you're cool, that is. In which case, you stroll into camp, draw your sword, and promptly massacre like a billion enemy soldiers. Make your way through enough of them, and you'll eventually hit a new endgame screen, reading \"You changed history! Sigismund lost his army and returned to Hungary in disgrace.\" You see? Indiv…",

Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397 , a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance. According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law. \"Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents,\" said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. \"They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system.\" (Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO) Sigmon, who we spoke with last year about the claims and potential consequences of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit , said both this week's '387 patent and last week's '397 represent procedural irregularities in the decisionmaking…",
