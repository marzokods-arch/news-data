We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Food and videogames have gone hand in hand since Pac-Man gobbled down his first few cherries. In games, food can represent all sorts of things: a way to replenish health or stamina, a source of power-ups or buffs, or a skill to level up while cooking over a stove or campfire. A special meal can be a gift to bestow on an NPC you're in love with, a cultural milestone in a city builder, or even a way to assassinate someone—as with Oblivion's famous poisoned apples. Since every gamer is well-versed in the importance of food, I'm giving you a culinary challenge in today's quiz. Identify the 10 games below based only on a screenshot of their food. Time to see if you can cook! It's not as easy as it sounds—if you haven't played one of the games in the quiz, you probably won't recognize its edible items—but there should be enough context in the screenshots to give you some idea of what game it's from, even if you've never chowed down on it. Just type in your answer below…",

Rainbow Six Siege saw a big boost in player numbers earlier this year when the X update went live, from more than 66,000 concurrents on Steam on June 9, according to SteamDB , to more than 142,000 on June 10. But it's been a downhill ride ever since, and concurrent player counts now are actually lower than they were immediately prior to the free-to-play shift. User reviews have also taken a turn downward: The overall rating on Steam remains \"very positive\" but recent reviews are \"mixed,\" with an uptick in cheaters seemingly the most common complaint. Improving Rainbow Six Siege X's anti-cheat is the first priority for the dev team: Game director Joshua Mills and creative director Alex Karpazis wrote in today's update that \"our systems in Siege X did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress.\" The update doesn't go into d…",

But when things start to get into the realm of cheating the system itself, and illicitly siphoning off money from the creator program, it turns out Epic's lawyers play a whole other ballgame. Fortnite has for many years hosted user-created experiences called islands, provides a suite of tools to make their creation as easy as possible, and then pays out money to the creators of the most popular maps. There are various metrics to determine payouts: session length, player count, and whether players go on to buy anything. This isn't chump change either: Epic says it pays out millions of dollars every year to community creators. So two miscreants took a look at that situation, and came up with a plan. Build some experiences, juice the player numbers through the roof with bots, and then sit back and profit. That's what Epic alleges in a new filing in Michigan against Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nas…",

But that punishing permadeath for everything the sandworm swallows has been de-fanged, at least a little bit: a new patch for Funcom's survival MMO means that you don't have to lose your vehicle forever even if it goes down a sandworm's gullet. There's a catch, however. Thanks to the new \"vehicle recovery system\" added in Dune: Awakening patch 1.2.10.0, your vehicle backup tool now literally backs up your rides instead of just acting like a handheld garage. \"When vehicles that you personally own are removed from the world by the sandworm, coriolis storms, or complete destruction via combat they can now be recovered for a fee from a new Recovery mode in the Vehicle Backup Tool,\" says Funcom. You'll have to pay for this very important insurance, of course, and there's one other wrinkle in the bargain. \"In addition to a Solari fee, recovered vehicles will lose 15% of their maximum r…",

Regis also played a pivotal role in The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion, and to be fair he had a pretty wild 'do in that one too.

Also some undeniably phenomenal hair going on there.

    "body": "Hapless American tourist George Stobbart is back again (again), with Revolution Software celebrating the success of its 2024 remaster by remastering Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror. If you missed it the first time around (perhaps because you weren't born in 1997), then you're in for a treat. George and French journalist Nico Collard say goodbye to Paris and Templar conspiracies and instead find themselves in South America uncovering a Mayan mystery. George really doesn't know how to take a normal holiday. This updated version will feature 4K art and the return of Broken Sword 1's story mode—a more relaxed mode that gives you a bit of assistance with puzzles, while not feeding you the solution. \"The Smoking Mirror has always been one of our most loved games, and with Reforged we were able to enhance it in ways that respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences\", says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. \"Just as with the first game, we can't wait for players old and new to experience it again.\" I truly adore the Broken Sword series and thought the remaster was pretty much perfect , aside from the slightly tinny audio. And it was a lot more fai…",

Sure, I'm now officially one of those annoying Pathfinder 2e guys who will tell you about how good the three-action system is (no but really, it's better), but Afterlight is actually shaping up really nicely so far. That's not to say I'm calling it here and now that it'll be perfect. It's developer Epictellers Entertainment's first ever game; CRPGs are hard to make; and it's still very, very early days. Starfinder: Afterlight is the first proper videogame to use Starfinder 2e—built upon Pathfinder 2e's framework. So far, Afterlight's developers have been a tad coy. Trailers are mostly (gorgeous-looking) artwork with voiceover layered atop it, and the Steam page only has a few brief stills, so I was curious to see how it looks in motion and, honestly? I think the folks at Epictellers are being a little gunshy. What I saw wasn't terrible at all—the environment, a space cantina bar with flickering neon signs, looks pretty and well-detailed. The character art (and voice-acting) is solid. And while combat animations are a little rough around the edges, everything el…",

    "body": "Almost one year on from its first-ever PC case, Havn has returned with something new. The Havn BF 360 isn't quite as flashy as its bigger sibling, the HS 420 , but it's every bit as brilliant. The Havn BF 360 is available in either black or white, and I was fortunate to be able to test both colourways for review. Great news for you, dear reader, less so me moving around my small, now very cramped, office. While I am a fan of the white HS 420, the black version is the better-looking of the BF 360 options. That's mostly down to the front panel. Both versions come with speckled, textured front panels—the thing that lured me to these cases when they were first displayed on the Computex showfloor—but the lighter panel looks a lot better in contrast to the black shell. The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis. Havn has even handed me a diagram of all the various prototypes it worked through for where it put the supports for these vents and how it landed on the final design for …",

No level of PC gaming hardware will be enough to change the fact that I absolutely suck at competitive first-person shooters. Even when I actually had a 23-year-old's reaction time, I was still almost the worst Quake IV player in the entire office. Okay, I still slay at FIFA, sorry, FC26, but even so, I don't really want to play online let alone in a tournament. So, maybe I'm not the right person to be checking out the new On-Stage Standard arm rests for the Titan Evo, even so, I was kinda expecting more. More accuracy and more, well, technology. After all, flipping open the box with the new twin chair arms staring up at me with their translucent sides, covering circuit boards, sitting beneath twin LCD panels, they immediately give off a real techie vibe. These are the Secretlab InfinitePrecision Armrests in all their ultra precise glory. A set of chair arms designed to deliver the \"most precise setup ever designed for pro players.\" And if that doesn't strike you as faintly ridiculous then you probably are the tar…",

Now I will say that my usual response to developers championing community feedback is for my eyes to roll into the back of my head as I tick it off my bingo card of cliché dev phrases, but in this case, it really does seem like Battlefield Labs has had a major impact on Battlefield 6's development.
