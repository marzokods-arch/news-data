This period is important because it's when Microsoft released Windows 8 , a version of the PC operating system that was supposed to be an OS for all devices, but mostly just succeeded at pissing people off.

It sounds like a medical issue but I assure you, it's all about ensuring the Steam Frame's wireless connection is strong, stable, and appears high quality. The Steam Frame offers a few ways to play games, both locally on its own Arm chip and streamed from a nearby gaming PC. As the name suggests, foveated streaming is used during the latter. \"So, a lot of people might have heard of foveated rendering,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve working on the Steam Frame, says. \"That's where you use the direction you're looking at to optimise what the device is doing. So it only has to do a lot of work in that area. We are doing something similar to that dedicated to the streaming process.\" Foveated streaming requires the Steam Frame's new eye tracking feature. This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time. The clearest patch of your vision, that's thanks to your fovea, hence the name. Connecting to a PC via its own wireless adapter and a dedicated 6 GHz connection, the Steam Frame h…",

With BF Studios rushing to quell these issues as Steam reviews drop to Mixed, Battlefield 6's developers have also addressed the situation. Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it.

This isn't the Valve Index 2, it's something quite different, but it should still appeal to hardcore VR users and new users alike. The Steam Frame is a standalone VR headset.

So, what makes this a PCVR headset again? \"We see Steam Frame as a streaming first headset,\" Lawrence Yang, a designer at Valve, tells me. Streaming in this context does not refer to cloud streaming or showcasing your skills on Twitch. Rather streaming means playing a game on a gaming PC and streaming it over to the Steam Frame via a wireless connection. So, you're streaming the game from one PC to another PC on your head, without using any cables.
