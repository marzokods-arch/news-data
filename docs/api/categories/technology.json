The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC takes what we like about the standard V3 Pro, adds an 8,000 Hz polling rate, as well as TMR thumbsticks, and comes in at the exact same price. If you play on PC, and have the $200 spare to afford it, the V3 Pro 8K PC is a no-brainer. At 220 g, it's a bit lighter than you might expect (being around 60 g less than the Xbox wireless controller) but that doesn't mean it's not sturdy. Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way. If you want to click as quick as possible, flip it the other way. All of these little customization options, paired with Razer Synapse 4, makes this controller super adjustable and the super high polling rate can give y…",

Being familiar with extraction games actually does you a disservice on this detail because most others boot you out into the map and make you spend several runs trying to find a foothold with gear to get your first true extraction. Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so. If you're like me you probably went at least five early runs dead as a duck trying to extract by going through the Northwest Camp without realizing the bunker entrance is also a valid exit point too. There are three extraction points in Escape From Duckov's Ground Zero map . One is obvious, marked on your map. The other two options are returning to the bunker, either by going back the way you came in or finding another secret bunker entrance.

Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve. Inspired by movies like Inception, The Matrix, District 9, and Elysium, sticking to sci-fi \"gives the opportunity to play around with stuff and think about what is fun,\" says 10 Chambers COO Svante Vinternatt. Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

It's the best handheld gaming PC in many respects, but not really worth all that money, and while it's lacking in some key features, it's apparently easily upgradeable. This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice. Thankfully, though, the ROG Xbox Ally X has an easily-accessible M.2 slot, so you can swap it out with a new one of your ch…",

That's according to Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation, who says that over the past few months, the site has seen a \"decrease of roughly 8% as compared to the same months in 2024\" in human pageviews. After updating its bot detection systems, the Foundation \"found that much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.\" \"We believe that these declines reflect the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,\" says Miller, \"especially with search engines providing answers directly to searchers, often based on Wikipedia content.\" The AI answers that Google spits up top of the SERPs, in my experience, tend to reference articles from publications—such as yours truly—more so than Wikipedia.

As the dust begins to settle and services have, in large part, recovered, it's just left to the analysts to determine exactly how much financial damage was accrued. One such candidate is the CEO of internet monitoring firm Catchpoint, Mehdi Daoudi, who spoke to CNN about the fallout from AWS' rather public faceplant. \"The incident highlights the complexity and fragility of the internet, as well as how much every aspect of our work depends on the internet to work,\" said Daoudi. \"The financial impact of this outage will easily reach into the hundreds of billions due to loss in productivity for millions of workers that cannot do their job, plus business operations that are stopped or delayed— from airlines to factories.\" While that figure initially seems excessive, when you take into account the scope of the outage, it's perhaps not too far out of th…",

The demo wastes no time in immersing you into its world.There's no introduction, no story to follow, you just wake up in a boat in the middle of the sea, engulfed by darkness. From there you're given a prompt on how to sail, but for the most part you just have to figure everything out: where to go, who you are, and who you've just pulled into your boat from the water. There is a significant lack of hand-holding throughout the demo, which is noticeable from the get-go. You're given visual clues to follow, such as red lights floating in the ocean, but aside from that you are left to your own devices. You do have an AI/co-op partner, though.

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",

Today's update will be the last: The game is being delisted on October 21, and the servers will be switched off on January 20, 2026 , rendering the game unplayable. Today's update will disable real money transactions in The Sims Mobile, but will grant players unlimited energy to \"make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.\" The game will roll along until January 6, 2026, at which point all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will unlock for all players, with no level-based limitations--everyone gets everything. \"We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything TSM has to offer before the servers close,\" EA said in the shutdown announcement. \"We would love to see what you create if you would like to share it with us.\" Seems a little weird to me that EA isn't just doing that right from the hop. The game is cooked anyway, so why not just open the floodgates and let players go ham? At a time like this I can't help but think back to Gary Larson's famous pearl of wisdom: …",

No, not the infamous Blue Screen of Death (which has since changed to the Black Screen of... Death), but the Windows Recovery Environment , or WinRE for short. Here you can repair startup issues, access the command prompt, and adjust a whole host of important system settings outside of the regular Windows 11 desktop with ease—or at least you could, up until you installed a security update released alongside the Windows 11 25H2 update for many users last week. As per Microsoft's Win 11 25H2 known issues page, update KB5066835 has stopped USB devices, like keyboard and mice, from functioning in WinRE. Which is, of course, the primary way to control any of the vital system recovery tools within. Bully. Our Nick has tested this issue himself and reported that, while he could move the mouse and flip between options with the keyboard, each input resulted in around four seconds of lag, making it extremely tedious to use. So, it's perhaps not as serious for some users as Microsoft claims, but it sure sounds like a frustrating experience to add on top of your, well, frustrating experien…",

    "body": "I've been enjoying Fellowship more than I expected over the weekend—at first, I thought \"WoW's Mythic+ without the MMO\" would be a glorified daycare for World of Warcraft players who are too old to keep up with newfangled grinds . And I was right (partially because I'm one of them), but also, it's just a really clever little game. I could talk on and on about how it de-incentivises toxicity, has some really neat boss and class designs, and a progression system that constantly rewards you instead of de-levelling your key and taking your lunch money. And I might. But the thing I'm really impressed by is one tiny little UI feature that solves a problem that's been plaguing World of Warcraft (and other MMOs) for years. Decades, even. See, in MMOs, a secondary responsibility for damage dealers—other than blasting—is interrupting enemy spellcasting. Usually, specific abilities need to be interrupted or else the pull of that particular dungeon gets way harder. This adds a nice layer of coordination if you're playing with your friends, but let's face it—the majority of dungeon runs are probably done with pick-up groups, right? In which case, given you're playing with two to three other DP…",

Which is exactly what one Redditor has done : slapped the new AAA FPS title on one of those dinky little CPU cooler screens. The AIO in question looks to be an MSI MPG CoreLiquid P13 360 , and yes, that cooler does actually let you use the screen as an extended display rather than just importing gifs or video files to replay on it. Which means this very likely is Battlefield 6 (BF6) actually playing on the little screen, rather than a streamed video or moving image. It doesn't look like the game's all too playable on the round screen, though—half of the HUD is cut off. Our Jacob Ridley discovered this HUD-chopping effect himself when he tried the cooler's hand at playing Doom in-browser. We didn't rate the cooler very highly, but perhaps the ability to play BF6 on it changes things somewhat… or not, because it's entirely pointless. But being pointless doesn't stop it from being hilarious—in …",

And while the idea of the US waging war on time itself might seem amusing, China sees the attacks as no joke, as the research facility is said to be responsible for timing services used by communications, finance, power, transport, and defence services throughout the country. According to AP News , a post from the Ministry of State Security on WeChat accused the US National Security Agency (NSA) of exploiting vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a mobile phone brand to steal information from National Time Center employees back in 2022. Since then, the ministry says that the NSA used 42 types of \"special cyberattack weapons\" to disrupt the internal network systems, and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024—although no evidence was provided in the post to backup these claims. \"The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself,\" the post continues. \"Repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats.\" After discovering the breach, the min…",
