Now that's not a bad thing, I love completing little missions in exchange for trinkets, but at first glance Arc Raiders' Trials seemed easier than they turned out to be. Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them. This is because you don't gather progress over multiple runs, you have to complete the challenge in one go. \"Raider Trials have raised a few questions, so here's the 101,\" an official Arc Raiders social media post says. \"Progress only counts per single sur…",

But that's where my heart immediately sank when I logged in to check the new store bundles—the first store refresh since launch. That new Scrappy diving helmet added in the new Deep Sea Bird set costs 900 raider tokens, and includes the Scrappy outfit, an emote, and a little charm. Thankfully, all of these items can also be purchased individually, but the cool helmet costs 700 tokens by itself.

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

(More on this later.) Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever.

Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit.

If you listened to a very particular crowd back when it was revealed the game would feature Yasuke, a real historical figure who's been referenced a whole bunch in Japanese media anyway, you'd have thought it was the end of days. Initially, Ubisoft tried to mollify said crowd , calm them down which… Well, it went about as well as you'd expect. The sky didn't fall. What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .' Speaking at a BAFTA event last year, former franchise head Marc-Alexis Coté put his foot down: \"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and t…",

All for the sake of science and AI. So, what does one do with a $20,000 rig (that hiss you're hearing is all the air leaving my lungs at once)? Well, in the beginning, the YouTuber—whose real name is Felix Kjellberg— ran protein folding simulations at night in aid of cancer research. Neat! But it wasn't long before Kjellberg disappeared into the rabbit warren of locally hosting massive AI models , eventually creating an AI-powered council and appointing himself as dictator. Kjellberg explains that instead of asking Google or querying ChatGPT things like, 'who would be the best creator to collaborate with next,' he instead consults his AI council. He elaborates, \"I have eight GPUs that can run the same model [specifically a version of Qwen ]. Each one of them is a different council member with different personalities. …",

This is why the only extraction shooter I've really vibed with is the striking, atmospheric, PvE-only The Forever Winter . But with Arc Raiders being all anyone can talk about at the moment, I thought I should at least check it out. Arc Raiders shares some similarities with The Forever Winter, with its biggest threats all being robotic monstrosities, and with players all serving as desperate scavengers.

Google has recently warned \"adversaries are no longer leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) just for productivity gains, they are deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations\". The report (via Bleeping Computer ) says that, for the first time, Google \"discovered a code family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behaviour.\" Google pays attention to one particular malware named Promptflux, which is a dropper that prompts Gemini to rewrite its own source code, \"saving the new, obfuscated version to the Startup folder to establish persistence.\" Like an actual virus, this suggests it has the ability to 'evolve' in some way, getting smarter and harder to get rid of.
