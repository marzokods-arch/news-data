The first third-party game to be published under Hitman developer IO Interactive's Partners programme, its debut has been rather sour‚Äîpoor sales, a Mostly Negative rating on Steam, and layoffs at developer Build a Rocket Boy. That's not to mention the bizarre accusations being flung around from its co-CEOs. Former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies blamed the game's failure on \" internal and external saboteurs, \" a sentiment that had been echoed by Mark Gerhard just a couple of months prior when he popped off on Discord to claim that the negative reactions to the game were \"100%\" financed by someone . A mystery someone. It's enough of a palaver to make anyone wary of trying again, and IOI CEO Hakan Abrak certainly seems apprehensive to re-enter the lion's den. During a recent interview with IGN , Abrak reflected on the initial response to MindsEye: \"It was a tough reception,\" he said. \"It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and ‚Ä¶",

After a charming stop-motion vignette in which Ara's friends have to find his bones to turn him back from stone, the host reveals his face for the first time‚Äîdressed in a suit to deliver the final bit of news, that Silksong is, in fact, releasing today. \"We finally, finally made it,\" he says, adding that he's been doing this for, in a massive understatement, \"quite a long time. \"Enough time for many things in one's life to change‚Äîand a lot of things have changed in my life during that time.

Below, I'll go over all you need to know about Marvel Rivals Season 4 right now, including the release date and the latest news on new heroes and other content arriving in the next major update. Marvel Rivals Season 4 release date and time Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches on Friday, September 12, 2025 , after server downtime at 1 am PDT / 4 am EST / 9 am GMT, which coincides with the end of Season 3 (though the battle pass will stick around). The mid-season update, Season 4.5, should launch on or around Friday, October 10, 2025, just one month after the first half of the update. Honestly, I'm still not used to this faster pace, with full seasons lasting just two months.

I'm so impressed by the new act that I'll forgive the pacing issues in the rest of the campaign. After all, that's what releasing your game in early access is for, right? Part of me sympathizes with PoE 1 players who hate spending 30 hours getting torn apart by regular old skeletons when all they want to do is charge straight to the endgame. The endless mazes in act 3 test my patience every time I replay it, but now that I've seen what lies beyond that, I trust GGG to find a good balance of soulslike pacing and action RPG ‚Ä¶",
