A good example of a mod that was not created to solve a practical problem is Epic's Skibidi Toilet , which creator EpicNNG said was made specifically \"to spite Samuel Winkleclank.\" That would be Borderlands 4 narrative director Sam Winkler, who apparently brought this upon himself by saying Borderlands 4 would cut back on the \"toilet humor\" of Borderlands 3 . \"If the word 'skibidi' ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears,\" Winkler proclaimed fatefully.

Others on the team didn't experience this bug, but I saw it pop up all the way through my time in haunted Ebisugaoka. Turns out my habit of switching off motion blur without even thinking about it whenever I see it in the options menu is the problem, which I wish I'd known 20 hours ago when I started the game. Leave motion blur on and apparently you'll never experience this particular glitch. You will have to put up with cutscenes locked to 30 fps, and a stamina-based combat system, and weapon durability, and one particularly daft twist, but there are people out there who like each and every one of those things. I can't imagine there's anyone who likes playing chunks of a game in one quarter of their screen real estate, but I could be wrong.

I also know a couple of the Marvel movies have gone deep into R-rated territory and shown him popping his claws through people's domes. I somehow just wasn't expecting the game to be quite as graphic as it is. Like, so many people are stabbed right in the head in the trailer. Not just in the head, but in the face . I read X-Men comics as a kid for probably 10 years, and Wolverine killed plenty of people in them, and I even remember a miniseries of comics where he definitely put his claws directly through a dude's face. But I feel like that was somewhat of a rare occurrence. He'd slash people up, sure, but it was rarely all that bloody on the page. I'm not complaining, I'm just a little taken aback, possibly because Insomniac's Spider-Man games are pretty PG, right?

First revealed back in August , Title Update 3 will add Eorzea-themed hunts, equipment, and cosmetics, which—while appreciated—still leaves Wilds' glaring performance issues largely unaddressed. The headlining addition in TU3 is Omega Planetes, the FF14 incarnation of Final Fantasy's recurring mechanical superboss who's somehow managed to hop dimensions into the Monster Hunter setting. Considering Omega is a superweapon whose prime directive is dragon killing, its presence presumably doesn't bode well for Monster Hunter's largely lizard-based ecology, so it's up to the hunters to boot it back to its proper reality.

It works by analyzing acoustic features like phonemes and intonation to create a stream of animation data, which is then mapped to a character's facial poses.

The idea, apparently, is to fuse \"mobile and PC\" into a single device. And given Qualcomm is part of this particular conversation, that device would presumably be running an Arm chip rather than a traditional x86 PC processor. The venue for all this is Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025 , where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon had an on-stage conversation with Google SVP of Platforms & Devices Rick Osterloh. Google said last year that it planned to base ChromeOS on Android in future, as opposed to being its own stand-alone OS. At the summit, the pair fleshed out some of the details. \"In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,\" Osterloh said. That has meant, for instance, that running Android apps on a ChromeOS device required a virtual machine. But ChromeOS will now be a part of the overall Android stack. \"We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems. \"This is …",

    "body": "While the graphics card market is dominated by Nvidia in terms of share, when it comes to performance-enhancement technologies, it's a much more even playing field. This is especially true when it comes to frame generation, as Intel has a system that's better than AMD's, even though it's far behind in discrete GPU sales. And if the naming of some software configuration code is anything to go by, Intel might even have something planned to put its frame gen tech on par with Nvidia's. The code in question is an 'extensible application markup language' file that Intel uses to configure how its Graphics Software app. It basically determines which menus, options, etc, get shown for whatever Arc graphics cards or iGPU you have in your PC. Sharp-eyed Redditor Organic-Bird-587 noticed something distinctly unusual in the wording of one section. (Image credit: Intel) You can see the heading for the code section clearly states 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', and the reason why this is noteworthy is because Intel's current implementation of XeSS Frame Generation isn't 'multi' at all; the algorithm only creates a single frame, just like AMD's system does. However, Nvidia's DLSS 4 frame gen tec…",

    "body": "I'll be honest, the amount of time I've spent waiting around in a game while various friends get themselves ready probably exceeds the time I actually spend playing the game. With something like Peak , where you need to all be present at the very start of the game, the chances of everyone being ready at the time we've agreed to is next to none. So, having ways to pass the time while you wait for someone to make a cup of tea, eat their dinner, or return from the heavy fog they've somehow disappeared into in the time it took for them to reply to a message and join the game, is essential. However, the opportunities to pass time in the airport before you set off on your climbing adventure in Peak are incredibly limited. Or at least they were until now. You have a climbing wall, and aside from running up and down the travelator, you're stuck for any activities really. Luckily, the \"Dillydally mini-update\" has rolled out, adding two new games to the airport to keep you entertained until it's time to head off. You'll now be able to make use of a basketball court and chess board, which is bound to distract my friends even further before we actually get to climb any mountains. Although you…",

We already had a pretty good idea that Baby Steps was going to be very good thanks to our March preview , but this confirms it. There are some complaints, and at least one critic didn't vibe with it at all, but overall? Baby Steps does what it does very well, and what it does is drive people bananas with rage even as it compels them to keep playing. We have our own full Baby Steps review for you thanks to PC Gamer's walking warrior Jody Macgregor, but here's a look at what others are saying. \"There's so much to love here\" GamesRadar : 3.5/5 GR takes some issue with the lengthy gaps between certain challenges, and the fact that watching Nate, the…",

I'm sure I'll watch the movie out of curiosity (or because my boss makes me review it) but it does feel like it's arriving about a decade too late. That's because it's arriving about a decade too late. The Watch Dogs movie was announced back in 2013, the same year as the Harlem Shake, and Beyonce lip-syncing at Obama's first inauguration, and the Game of Thrones show's Red Wedding. That's how damn long ago this movie was announced . More perspective: 2013 was the year Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag came out. Ubisoft has released eight more Assassin's Creed games since the Watch Dogs movie was greenlit. So, yeah, it took quite a while to get rolling, but last year we got confirmation that filming was actually underway , and we've now gotten confirmation that filming has wrapped (at least mostly) and we may actually get to see this gosh darn movie at some point before we're planted.

Well well well… it looks like someone had a surprise up their sleeve, because today brought the announcement of an unexpected crossover, albeit with scant detail. Palworld is collaborating with Ultrakill, a brilliant indie shooter by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala that's still in early access itself, and continuing to blow minds (the game sits at \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam with roughly 120K user reviews). Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together. Palworld's most recent high-profile crossover was with Terraria , which caused a big spike in players, so expect something si…",
