Fast-forward to my young adulthood and suddenly the Sega of old was no more, and watching games like Shenmue 2 release on Xbox felt oddly like betrayal. But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox. I fell in love with Halo and would go head-over-heels for Halo 2, and lived for years with a magazine poster for Halo 3 behind my television with that magical promise: \"Finish the fight.\" I did do other things, I promise, but I spent an awful lot of time with the Master Chief, and Xbox and Halo became synonymous in my mind with peak console gaming.

CEO Aaron Licht says, \"Our move into gaming mice had one goal: to deliver an extremely lightweight mouse that helps users compete at the highest levels of the leaderboards.\" On the internals, Be Quiet! shares that both mice have optical Omron D2FP-FN2 switches and a PixArt PAW3950 sensor. They can also be configured using a web-based app for Windows, iOS, and even Linux (via Chromium-based browsers) without the need for any software. This is a neat touch. Both the Ergo and Sym will be available from February 3 with a suggested retail price of $110. We do like plenty of Be Quiet! products: We declared the Light Mount the best gaming keyboard of 20…",

He too said that shockwaves made escaping fights too easy—but added they also negate high-ground advantage, ruin early rotations, and outclass all other mobility items. Fans wondered whether NickEh30's prompted Epic's move, but Timmins denied that in his post. I and most users on the game's subreddit disagree with the decision to vault shockwaves—I'll explain why in a minute—but I do sympathize with both Timmins and NichEh30. Shockwaves can be a crutch.

While it's much more subtle and nebulous than these changes, Bungie has also claimed it's \"doubling down on the dark, gritty, and grounded sci-fi world\" through an updated visual style, \"deepened environmental storytelling\", and the narrative-tracking Codex. This focus on narrative and world in an extraction shooter is rather hard to understand without seeing it in action.

The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

Kuhlmann left Bethesda in 2023, around the time of Starfield's launch, so he was there throughout development and thus was present for a lot of changes in regards to how Bethesda worked and how staff communicated. When he was working on Skyrim, itself a massive endeavour, things were simpler. \"I was working directly on the game, and I was a lead,\" he says. \"That was how all the leads worked then, and so I was directly working with all the people, all the quest designers, myself.\" But from Skyrim on, that started to change, and it was \"one of the main things\" that Kuhlmann \"didn't like\".

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts.

I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle.

    "body": "Unlike its older, mobile-exclusive sibling, the worldwide Arknights: Endfield launch times and release date are almost upon us with a dedicated PC client in hand. The 3D spin-off will launch at the same time across all platforms, so you can have your pick between the fancy bells and whistles of your machine or take Endfield on the go as soon as servers are live. It's certainly an upgrade from my days of using the Google Play PC client or whatever overly demanding emulator was fashionable at the time. And while Hypergryph's new strategic RPG certainly looks different from the first game, it's still a gacha, so I've got the Arknights: Endfield launch times organized by time zone below to make sure you're on top of those dailies. When is the Arknights: Endfield unlock date and time? Arknights: Endfield launches at 11 am (UTC+8) on Thursday, January 22. Since it's a global launch on all platforms, you folks living in Pacific time can play a day early on Wednesday, January 21, at 7 pm PST. The Arknights: Endfield client is available through Hypergryph's official site or Epic Games . If you plan on playing, I recommend at least checking out the official site (and missions ) ahead of tim…",

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

The series has finally wrapped up now, and Newbon spent a chunk of the final episode summing up his feelings about a game he clearly enjoys playing as much as he enjoyed working on. \"Baldur's Gate 3, the game that just keeps on fucking giving,\" is how he sums it up. \"It is one of my all-time favorite games,\" he goes on to say, \"not because simply I'm biased because I'm in it, it actually is one of the best-crafted games I've ever, ever played. It's absolutely extraordinary and really wonderful.\" And, of course, it's a deeply personal game for its creators. \"Just goes to show to you folks,\" Newbon says, \"fuck AI. This game could never be made by AI. It's too interesting, subtle, crazy, off-the-wall, pathos-filled—it's too human. There's no fucking way AI could make this.\" Near the end of the episode Newbon lets the credits play, giving shout-outs to several of the individuals involved, and making sure we see the names of the…",
