Ars does not accept paid editorial content. Late last year, we drove BMW's new iX3 . It's the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the \"Neue Klasse.\" Later this year, we'll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand's M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV. There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the i4 , iX , and i7 . And each time we've driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren't true M cars, not like the M3 or M5 . Honestly, they weren't better than the cheaper, less powerful versions , something that won't be allowed for next year's performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based. \"The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment,\" says Franciscus van Meel, managing di…",

The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign. A focus on Linux inside the cloud VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases.

As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been racing to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have profound economic effects on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country's electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old and under strain. Read full article Comments",

According to a New York Times report based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced analysis on the EPA website —the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs. Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.

    "body": "It's not really accurate to call the Wagoneer S Jeep's first electric vehicle. For several years now, Europeans have been able to buy the Jeep Avenger, a subcompact crossover that will surely never see American roads. But it is the first electric Jeep designed for American consumption. It's aimed at the highly competitive midsize SUV segment, which gets ever more crowded even as electrification faces a less certain future here. Indeed, the brand, along with its Stellantis sibling Chrysler, just shelved all its plug-in hybrids, discontinuing them just a few days ago. Like the little Avenger, the Wagoneer S makes use of one of parent company Stellantis' purpose-built EV platforms , one shared with the growly-sounding Dodge Charger . At 192.4 inches (4,886 mm) long, 74.8 inches (1,900 mm) wide, and 64.8 inches (1,645 mm) tall, it's a little larger than cars like the BMW iX3 or Audi Q6 e-tron but a little smaller than domestically designed rivals like the Cadillac Lyriq and Acura ZDX , which have particularly long wheelbases. I find it a rather handsome car, one that has to marry Jeep's Wagoneer styling cues with as many wind-smoothing and air-shaping elements as possible. The way the…",

Not only are we getting Godzilla Minus Zero in November—sequel to the critically acclaimed Godzilla Minus One (2023)—but Apple TV just released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters , part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse , which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters ( kaiju ) created by Toho Co., Ltd into the same fold. (Spoilers for S1 below.) The first season picked up where 2014's Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju —after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. The plot spans three generations and takes place in the 1950s and half a century later. In the first season, two siblings (Kate and Kentaro Randa) follow in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Naturally, they find themselves in the world of monsters and discover Army officer Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell), a longtime family ally. Read full article Comments",

Discovery (WBD) today by filing a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against WBD, declaring its intention to fight Netflix’s acquisition. In December, WBD agreed to sell its streaming and movie businesses to Netflix for $82.7 billion. The deal would see WBD’s Global Networks division, composed of WBD's legacy cable networks, spun out into a separate company called Discovery Global. But in December, Paramount submitted a hostile takeover bid and amended its bid for WBD. Subsequently, the company has aggressively tried to convince WBD’s shareholders that its $108.4 billion offer for all of WBD is superior to the Netflix deal. Today, Paramount CEO David Ellison wrote a letter to WBD shareholders informing them of Paramount’s lawsuit. The lawsuit requests the court to force WBD to disclose “how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’” of Paramount’s $30 per share all-cash offer.
