It's just been updated with a new M5 chip and a bizarre headband, but yep, that's the Vision Pro alright—still looking like an intriguing, but oddly-designed take on how the future of wearable tech should be. Well, Samsung has just launched its Galaxy XR headset , and if I'm not mistaken, I think I can hear the poor old Vision Pro howling from over here. Samsung looks to have used Apple's product as an example of what not to do, as many of the critiques of the Vision Pro seem fixed—on paper, at least. The pricing, for one. At $1,800, the Galaxy XR is still a bit of a teeth-clencher, but it's still nearly half the price of Apple's initial offering. It's also a good-looking device, with an outer screen that doesn't appear to display your bugged-out eyeballs to all and sundry.

According to this blog post on the Microsoft Dev site by Raymond Cheng , pifmgr.dll was added in Windows 95 and is chock full of icons that were created mostly for fun. The idea was that they provided a library of icons \"for people to use for their own homemade shortcut files.\" If Cheng's list is complete, there are a grand total of 38 icons contained in the dll file. The dll also does duty, \"as the name might suggest, to manage PIF files, which are Program Information Files that describe how to set up a virtual MS-DOS session for running a specific application.\" And yet it still clocks in at just 38 kilobytes. Remarkable in an age when your typical minor software update is measured in gigabytes and a multiple-terabyte SSD get filled up in picoseconds. Well, ish.

For a long time, DDR4 RAM was cheap enough to be worth consideration if you were looking to build a budget gaming PC. But judging from some recent charts shared by semiconductor analyst Ray Wang , DDR4 pricing is now so expensive it's hardly worth it compared to DDR5, even with DDR5 pricing having increased. There's no source given for these charts, but it tracks with other analysis and even consumer tracking such as on pcpartpicker.com , and Wang is a reliable industry analyst. The AI boom (or bubble) has most certainly played a big part in this, because AI datacentres require tons of DRAM for stacks of high bandwidth memory (HBM). And while DDR5 memory offers the latest and greatest on this front, much of this will be spoken for by big customers, leading many to fall back to DDR4, creating more demand and causing this price rise. This will have combined with declining DDR4 production as DRAM manufacturers transition more heavily towards DDR5, resulting in tons of demand and less supply. Thus, higher prices.

Luckily, Once Upon a Katamari has come along to remind me of the moreish chaos of these games, and quickly reminded me why I have spent so many hours essentially rolling a virtual ball around. Once Upon a Katamari is the newest mainline addition to the Katamari franchise in 14 years. It's as bright and chaotic as ever, but with a number of new additions to make each of its levels even more engaging. After warming back up to the controls and remembering just how annoyed I get every time I crash into an object I'm not ready to pick up yet, I was fully sucked back into its world.

    "body": "After a solid five hours with Battlefield 6 's new content coming in Season 1 , I can say with absolute certainty that it's the maps you should be most excited for. The new guns are cool—we only had access to those in the first phase, so the SOR-300SC carbine, Mini Scout sniper, and GGH-22 pistol—but the Blackwell Fields and Eastwood maps are, simply put, wonderful. This is, by far, the most intense yet breathable map in Battlefield 6, but what struck me is how instantly iconic it felt. Battlefield 6's maps have been controversial since the very beginning, to say the least. Of its launch offerings, I think Siege of Cairo is fantastic (as is the returning Operation Firestorm), and I'm open to Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak, and even New Sobek City when people aren't abusing the rooftops. But other than Cairo, I wouldn't say any of these arenas are all that memorable or iconic. If you've instead been waiting for more of the large-scale warfare that the series is traditionally known for, then Season 1 will be a salve. Already, we're getting two large maps in Blackwell Fields and Eastwood. Both maps support ground and air vehicles, though only Blackwell Fields features jets. Bla…",

Supports in Battlefield 6 can fully revive teammates with a charged defib hit and can also dish out regular ammo refills, making them the most self-efficient and reliable class to play.

We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that.\" Buckley isn't laboring under the assumption that Pocketpair can stem the onrushing tide of AI-powered games, and predicted that the next few years will see a big uptick of \"really low-quality, AI-made games,\" something he says is already happening on Steam. \"It's something that has plagued other stores but Steam had been go…",

As of this morning, many servers advertising themselves as \"XP farms\" or \"all bots\" have had their XP privileges taken away—you can still play on them, but you'll only earn a pittance of precious experience. Some noticed the XP purge actually began on October 17, the same day BF Studios announced other XP changes , but now it's official. The change comes after a week of XP farms being the most popular way to bypass Battlefield 6's career grind. Battlefield 6's Portal browser promised a slice of '07 FPS culture : custom rulesets, weird maps, and community servers with a revolving door of regulars. That all went up in smoke on launch day, as XP farm lobbies started cropping up en masse, clogging up all the server space so badly that nobody else could host anything for days. While I'm still occasionally seeing the \"Global Quota Exceeded\" error, a quick tour around the Portal browser this morning revealed a lot more legitimate servers full of players (hardcore playlists, jet practice lobbies, and a chill Conquest servers simply called \"Manny's Server\") and fewer XP farms.

The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC takes what we like about the standard V3 Pro, adds an 8,000 Hz polling rate, as well as TMR thumbsticks, and comes in at the exact same price. If you play on PC, and have the $200 spare to afford it, the V3 Pro 8K PC is a no-brainer. At 220 g, it's a bit lighter than you might expect (being around 60 g less than the Xbox wireless controller) but that doesn't mean it's not sturdy. Our Alex says this controller is \"solid all over\" and praises the texture grips and great build quality. That's not all Razer's latest has going for it though. It comes with programmable buttons, plus a sequence of back paddles, and the triggers can be adjusted to swap travel distance. If you like a long press from your triggers, flip it one way. If you want to click as quick as possible, flip it the other way.

Duckov is actually a lot more forgiving than that, it just won't tell you so. If you're like me you probably went at least five early runs dead as a duck trying to extract by going through the Northwest Camp without realizing the bunker entrance is also a valid exit point too.

Unlike Payday, which has a much more grounded setting, Den of Wolves wears its sci-fi inspirations on its sleeve. Inspired by movies like Inception, The Matrix, District 9, and Elysium, sticking to sci-fi \"gives the opportunity to play around with stuff and think about what is fun,\" says 10 Chambers COO Svante Vinternatt. Still, \"the freedom we have with this sci-fi space is a bit terrifying,\" admits Anders Svärd, 10 Chambers' master artist. This futuristic shooter has a suitably futuristic locale: the dystopian Midway City, a lawless, corporation-controlled metropolis built in the middle of the Pacific ocean between Japan and the US. Taking visual cues from Hong Kong's Kowloon Walled City, with buildings piled on top of each other, as well as Stockholm with its sea-level waterways, Midway is the perfect FPS playground.

This last point has come to light thanks to iFixit's recent disassembly of the handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X has been given the teardown treatment, and it turns out it's surprisingly easily upgradeable, at least in some ways. This has earned it a 7/10 score from iFixit, which isn't quite the 10/10 it awarded the Framework laptop , but is still pretty impressive, especially for a handheld. It's also upgradeable in ways that should be very relevant to many ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X owners (presumably the same applies to the non-X version, too, even though that wasn't tested). This is particularly true when it comes to storage and thumbsticks. The $1,000 handheld comes with a 1 TB SSD, which is decent for a handheld, but if you're paying gaming PC prices for a handheld, more storage than this would be nice.
