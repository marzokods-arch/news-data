I've played a little Dark Ties , and it's good fun going absolutely ham on the unsuspecting punks of Kamurocho as Mine, but there was almost a world where we would never have gotten to play him at all. RGG's original plan was for the Dark Ties' story to be, uh, basically a video they bundled onto the Kiwami 3 disc. It was \"something that could be viewed like a video,\" Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties director Ryosuke Horii recently told Famitsu (translated by Automaton ). So, you know, DarkTies.mp4 in other words. Thankfully, the devs at RGG realised it'd be much cooler if you actually got to step into Mine's immaculate Florsheims. Making Mine playable was, says Horii, \"the best way to tell his story,\" which is a very game developer response to the question, 'Why did you make this a videogame?'

Tom's Hardware was invited out to test out both the Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips recently, reporting test scores that look fittingly great. These are early numbers from benchmarks prechosen by Qualcomm, so it won't paint the whole picture, but they're impressive nonetheless. First off, in single-core CPU loads on Geekbench, the X2 Elite Extreme manages to get a score of 4080, which is 39% faster than the Snapdragon X Elite. Compared to the competition, the Strix Point AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 manages to get 2881, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H gets a score of 3026, and even Apple's M4 only got 3872. Then in multi-core tests, the X2 Elite Extreme received a score of 23491, which is double that of the Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, which got 11306.

It's undoubtedly my go-to way to play these days, especially now this 0.50 release candidate has made the game way easier to play on a gamepad. Don't tell anyone, but my first exposure to Morrowind was its original Xbox version, with its uncharismatic sans-serif fonts and its tendency to slyly reboot your entire console to cope with its strict RAM limits. I still have nostalgia for its gamepad iteration and, hell, I just like being able to kick back on my sofa or play things easily on my Steam Deck. \"Despite the nice round number, 0.50.0 is a focused release,\" writes OpenMW's capo (that's their name, not their rank), \"its core highlight is…",

Unfortunately, as a hardware writer renting creaky, drafty, listed buildings dating from the Georgian period, that beauty does not really translate into decent internet speeds. At the very least, the latest Windows 11 preview build offers one small feature that might make my life slightly easier. Rolling out to the Dev and Beta channel , preview build 26220.6760 will offer an internet speed check right from the Windows system tray in the taskbar. This feature is currently only accessible to Windows Insiders on Windows 11, version 24H2, and it won't mean my enduring friendship with Ookla's Speedtest.net will have to come to an end either. According to Windows Latest , Microsoft entered into a partnership with Ookla back in 2023 to provide Bing's speed test widget, and the new taskbar feature is just a more local redirect to this Bing widget. Windows Insiders can either launch the speed test from the Wi-Fi quick settings menu or by simply right-clicking the network icon in the system tray on the right-most side of the taskbar. Folks can test Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and cellular internet connections this way—and likely be just as frustrated when your best…",

Despite executive producer Tom Cannon saying in July that \"our goal is to keep the game up, online, and available\" from the closed beta's launch, it seems that Riot needs just a few days to get everything straightened out. A post on the 2XKO X account reads: \"We need a little more time to get early access up and running, so we'll be shutting down closed beta a few days early on Oct 3 @ 9pm PT.\" Servers will be back up and running in time for the early access launch on October 7 at 8am PT/11am ET/4pm BST. Riot says that offline mode will still work, so players should still be able to hit the lab, play local multiplayer, and face off against CPUs. Three-and-a-half days to do some tinkering behind the scenes is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially when I think about other fighting games who took their betas offline and straight-up vanished for a year— looking at you, Multiversus. The downtime news was released alongside a trailer for 2XKO's tenth champion, verifiable League mascot Teemo. And as someone who doesn't play the MOBA, I finally understand …",

And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered the best PC games you can play right now and a running list of the 2025 games that are launching this year. Blippo+ Steam ‌page‌ ‌ Release:‌ September 24 Developer:‌ YACHT, Telefantasy Studios, Noble Robot Originally released for the crank-powered Playdate, Blippo+ simulates a surreal public broadcasting channel made by aliens from planet Blip . It's about channel surfing a collection of bonkers TV channels which broadcast in real time, learning about alien culture and affairs, and marvelling at the awkward retro-futurism on display.

    "body": "If you have your eye on the upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC, be careful where you buy it from. As reported by Tom's Hardware , scalpers are already trying to rip people off with eBay listings charging over two times MSRP—while the ROG Xbox Ally X is still available for pre-order at its normal price. Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally. Both devices are set to launch on October 16. If you want to snag a Xbox Ally, it's best to avoid eBay entirely. At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double. If you consider the ROG Xbox Ally X part of the Xbox line-up ( which Microsoft seems to ), it's the most expensive Xbox to date. For $1,000, you get an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip, 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 7-inch FHD IPS display…",
