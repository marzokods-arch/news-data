Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

But honestly, all I ever really wanted was a good skin. A nice unique cosmetic was always my primary motivation for doing the Expedition project, not just because of the bragging rights, but because I like cosmetic options in games. Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam. But now the Expedition window has actually opened up and we can see a thumbnail of the outfit, things are looking good .

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024. With 14% of players doing so in 2025, it's starting to become a safe bet to assume that number will, on your average calendar year, hang around the 15% mark. As far a…",

If you browse through all the models it produces, you'll notice something very quickly: they're all very similar to each other. Some of the reasons behind this are all to do with saving manufacturing costs, but according to one company's PR representative, it turns out that the GPU makers themselves are pretty conservative about what can and can't be done. This insight was shared by Sapphire's Edward Crisler, its North America PR rep and PC gaming evangelist, on the latest edition of the Hardware Unboxed Podcast . Over the hour-long discussion, Crisler and HUB host Tim Schiesser chatted about all things gaming GPU-wise, from the RDNA 4 launch to the current RAM crisis, and even Nvidia's 12VHPWR meltygate power socket. While discussing VRAM and who gets to decide how much a card can have, Crisler said with a smile: \"I got to be careful of what I'm about to say here. I'm going to get in trouble.\" And that's when he opened the secret book of graphics card making that many folks have never had the pleasure of reading. \"Sometimes I really wish the chip makers would get out of the way and let us partners just make ou…",

Just like when we first had to find lemons and apricots for Scrappy's upgrades, you'll now spot a lot of Raiders running through the snowy wilderness frantically searching bushes. The only difference here is that staying out in the cold too long can actually kill you if you're not careful. If you are out Candleberry hunting, make sure to bring a safe pocket so you can squirrel away any that you do find. With that in mind, here's how to get Candleberries in Arc Raiders.

A new report from SEDaily claims, \"the two companies plan to finalize the contract around January of next year after evaluating whether the process can actually achieve the performance level AMD demands.\" SEDaily says the chip in question, \"is presumed to be AMD's next-generation central processing unit (CPU).\" Exactly what that means isn't clear. At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs. Samsung's SFP2 process is generally thought to be inferior to TSMC's various N2-generation silicon. However, AMD currently makes GPUs on …",

Titled \" How to optimize your gaming PC setup ,\" the guide touches on most key hardware issues, albeit with one fairly obvious omission. It kicks off with CPU and GPU recommendations. Frankly, an actually useful guide to all the currently available CPU and GPU options would make for a lengthy dissertation on its own. So Microsoft boils it down, thus: Entry-level gaming (1080p, medium settings) CPU: At least a modern quad-core like AMD Ryzen 5 5600 or Intel Core i5-12400 GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super or AMD Radeon RX 6600 Mid-range gaming (1440p, high settings) CPU: 6-core or better, such as AMD Ryzen 5 7600 or Intel Core i5-13600K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti / 4060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT High-end/4K gaming CPU: 8-core or better, like AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D or Intel Core i7-13700K GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or AMD Rade…",

It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.'

That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note.
