When you try to pry open a door in the tutorial, a pair of NPCs will suddenly appear to gun you down, then loot your body while you're incapacitated. But savvy players have figured out that if you drop all your items before that cutscene plays, you can pick them back up off the ground once your character awakens and then finish the rest of the tutorial with your pockets stuffed with goodies. None of the salvage you'll find in the tutorial is particularly important or mega valuable—you'll find much more and better stuff once you start playing the game proper—but why not take the leg up? It takes only a few seconds to pull up your inventory and empty your pockets. To keep all the loot from Arc Raiders' tutorial, make sure to drop it before you open the door in the abandoned pizza restaurant .

Midnight alpha testing started at the beginning of October and brought with it sweeping changes to its combat and classes, as well as an entire player housing system. Blizzard surprised everyone by completely disabling the functionality of the most popular mods that help players fight bosses and track their abilities, prompting some mod makers to cease development of their mods entirely . As a result of Blizzard's move to simplify the game so people don't have to rely on third-party mods, it also went through and reduced the amount of buttons you need to press for its most complicated classes. Unsurprisingly, these changes didn't go over well with everyone, and many high-level players are worried about the state of class design going into the full release. Today, Blizzard announced that the beta for Midnight will begin on November 11, which I'm sure doesn't assuage concerns over the current state of the game. For comparison: The…",

The extraction shooter makes a strong impression as you step into its post-future, '70s-tinged sci-fi Italy. Arc Raiders has a unique conceit for a PvPvE game that's fundamentally about filling a backpack with valuable stuff: You're a citizen of Spiranza, an underground city founded after humanity was forced underground by the Arc, a brigade of homicidal robots that dropped out of the sky one day. At the time of the game, the Arc have dominated the planet's surface for generations. As a raider, you're one of the few souls bold enough to brave the surface to loot for valuables. Sure, my main concern is finding batteries so I can craft a table that lets me craft scopes so that I can snipe other players, but as I'm foraging for scrap metal just outside the vision cone of a flame-throwing bowling ball, I have wondered who built these freaky little robots.

    "body": "One of the most anticipated games of the year, \"multiplayer extraction adventure\" Arc Raiders is challenging Escape From Tarkov as the extraction shooter du jour . In the words of PC Gamer's Morgan Park, Arc Raiders built up major buzz with a playtest in early 2025 thanks to its potent mix of \"the bones of Escape From Tarkov, the approachability of Gears of War, and the keen architectural eye of Swedish game development.\" It even overshadowed Bungie's long-awaited Marathon. After a few more betas to test the waters, Arc Raiders finally landed on October 30. As PC Gamer's Elie Gould breaks down in our Arc Raiders review-in-progress , PvP is an important element of the game, but may not be as big a focus as you'd expect. You'll spend much of your time hunting for loot and fighting (or avoiding) the Arc robots, making it \"quite different, both in vibes and execution\" than Escape From Tarkov. But Arc Raiders is still a big game with lots to learn: Where and what to loot, how to avoid or take down the Arc bots, the best gear and weapon upgrades, and so on. Below you'll find a collection of all of our Arc Raiders guides meant to give you a fighting chance on the surface where killer bot…",

The first few missions will have you looking for a battery and some wires, two items that I've seen plenty of during my preview and the beta test. But somehow, as soon as I needed them, they decided to disappear from every drawer and cupboard. There are certain spots scattered across each Arc Raiders map where you're more likely to find technological or electrical items like wires and batteries , and chances are, if you search a computer, you'll find what you need. But this isn't always guaranteed, and sometimes you'll raid rooms that have already been sorted through and stripped of valuables. (Image credit: Embark Studios) This happened to me during my first few games in Arc Raiders. I was on the lookout for six wires, but no matter where I searched or what I scrapped, I just couldn't seem to find anything. This is when PC Gamer guides writer Rory Norris and I hatched an ingenious idea. I had a battery that he needed, and he had the wires I needed, so we decided to exchange goods.

You can also upgrade Scrappy's gathering capabilities if you find a dog collar . There is one item, however, that's well worth filching if you come across it, and that's Assorted Seeds.

As a reference point, Samsung announced a new OLED panel for VR headsets with a 5,000 pixels-per-inch resolution earlier this year (pictured above). This new technology promises around 50,000 pixels per inch. Yikes.

For context, Stop Killing Games is a movement designed to require game companies to support their games after they've been shut down. As explained on its site , this doesn't mean forcing companies to maintain servers forever—rather, it requires them to have some sort of end-of-life plan in mind, which can take a lot of forms. For instance, giving fan communities the tools they need to run their own local servers. EU initiatives have a lot of stringent requirements before they can get in front of the politicians, including at least 1 million signatures, a minimum number of signatories each from a specific roster of countries, and—more importantly— verified signatures. Essentially, if you don't follow the rules, or aren't from within the EU, then your signature doesn't count. That question mark hung over the whole endeavour.
