    "body": "We don't know much about the next Mass Effect game in development at BioWare except that it's happening, and even that feels a little soft right now, what with all the layoffs and looming sale of Electronic Arts to Saudi Arabia . But one thing we do now know, thanks to a Fall Damage interview on YouTube with Commander Shepard actors Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale, is that they're both pretty eager to return to the role. After a bit of semi-philosophical musing on the question of whether Shepard is alive following the events of Mass Effect 3 (spoiler: well, maybe ), Hale invited fans to \"email the powers-that-be who make these games and say, 'Give us more Shepard, please'.\" \"Because we will be there, because we should not go,\" Hale says. \"I would be there with bells on if they asked us to play Shepard again.\" \"I agree,\" Meer then chimes in with faux seriousness, \"but only under any circumstances.\" It could happen. BioWare made a point of offing Shepard at the start of Mass Effect 2 , and insisted that it was really for real—but then of course he was brought back to life by the Lazarus Project so he could save us all from the Reaper threat. Classic hero stuff. If it can happen once, it…",

And between 2004 and 2018, it released 12 games, eight of which absolutely belong in every RPG lover's library. We're talking Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2, New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, Tyranny, and yes, even South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's an incredible list of games, and while some of them are looking a bit long in the tooth these days, I can't bring myself to not recommend every single one of them—and that's not just because PCG news writer Josh Wolens would curse me if I badmouthed Alpha Protocol. Since 2018, though? Things haven't been so great. (Image credit: Obsidian) The Outer Worlds and its sequel, along with Avowed, have plenty of defenders. They reviewed well— including here —and have their fans. But they're missing what made Obsidian's previous games so absurdly compelling: the best-in-class writing, the big risks and quests that stick with me years later. It feels like its acquisition by Microsoft has taught it to be cautious and boring, just like its risk-averse owner. But it's wild that its biggest swings happened …",

So far, I haven't been disappointed. We've seen numerous key locations in just the first couple of episodes, like Vault 24 and the Starlight Drive-In . And now, in the second episode, we've had a magnificent look at Area 51, as it was unveiled after the Brotherhood got its hands on cold fusion. (Image credit: Prime TV) The showrunners again proved how dedicated they are to depicting the Wasteland with care, a fact that executive producer Todd Howard raised during my interview: \"I always view the biggest character being the world. I think everybody involved with the show has taken such amazing care to treat locations with this obsessive authenticity. And I think that's what people like, and it's all practical, or most of it, right? More so than other shows or movies. \"They built so much of it. You walk on set,…",

Replays are usually something born from necessity, like work-related tasks, or my insatiable nostalgia for old RPGs. Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it. To be clear, that's two more times than I was asked to play for our South of Midnight review . I went at it a second time at my own leisure, then followed up again with a third replay so a friend could watch me, but I'll be damned if I didn't find some easy-to-miss, tiny detail with every press of 'new game' that made me fall in love with Hazel's journey through the American South all over again.

Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory. In the release version of Old World Blues there's a VR room that has been wrecked, and has no functionality. Here it works. Kinda.

Windows treats most drives as SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), which has been used for decades now and largely intended for hard drives. As such, NVMe drives that offer higher parallel performance than a hard drive are somewhat limited by the SCSI conversion: taking NVMe commands from an NVMe SSD and changing them to SCSI for the benefit of the OS, which introduces processing overhead and latency. You can see this for yourself by going into your PC's device manager -> Standard NVM Express Controller -> properties -> details -> class. It will be described as 'SCSIAdapter'. But Microsoft just announced that native NVMe support is now available in Windows Server 2025 ; essentially circumventing the entire conversion process and speeding things along. \"Switch onto Native NVMe as soon as possible or you are leaving performance gains on the table!\" Microsoft says in the announcement blog post. \"With Native NVMe in Windows Server 2025, the storage stack is purpose-built for modern hardware—eliminating translation layers and legacy constraints.\" (…",

At various stages, the suit witnessed accusations of demonic possession, lawyers throwing down Lil Wayne lyrics, and Aspyr desperately trying to conceal what it believes to be vital trade secrets. The lawsuit kicked off in late summer 2023, with gamer Malachi Mickelonis suing Aspyr for alleged consumer fraud after feeling \"completely duped\" the company, who had released KOTOR 2 on Switch in 2022.

The front support foot is slightly taller than the back one, giving it a lean of, if a fun 10 minutes spent with a spirit level and a child's protractor have produced correct results, about 10 degrees. This means you can still rest your coffee mug on the top, as long as it's not too full, but also that, if you're buying this smaller-than-average tower PC with the intention of it flitting flush with a piece of furniture, it won't. This may or may not be a problem, depending on how picky you are about these things, but the Predator logo that sticks off the front and looks rather like someone melded a Space Invader with a Decepticon means you might want to push it back a little further. Despite its drunken lean, it's not a bad case.

If you're not familiar with subpixel layouts, here's why that's a very good thing. Today's OLED gaming monitors have an issue. Not a huge one for gaming—any OLED is superb for playing games on—but more noticeable on some panels than others when you're browsing your desktop. It's especially noticeable if you're regularly typing out pages of words. It's called text fringing. Text fringing, as the name suggests, appears as a colourful border around characters rendered on an OLED panel. Sort of like a chromatic aberration effect in-game. It happens because the subpixels—red, green, and blue—don't align exactly with how the text is being rendered. In some OLED panels, that's because the subpixels are arranged in a triangular pattern, though LG's popular panels include a white subpixel in an RGWB structure. Text fringing is most obvious on panels with lower pixel densities, so namely 1440p monitors, though it'd be better to be rid of it completely. Well, that's what LG is offering with its latest OLED panel. Announced ahead of CES 2026, LG'…",

I've often gone on record to defend parrying on this site, despite the haters: Done well, these games are awesome. Parry fatigue? Bah, I say! I get that seeing a parry in every action RPG is getting a smidge wearisome, but if a game's built around timed blocking, rather than just using it as an excuse to ignore balance? It can become a delicious game of rock, paper, scissors that sees you riding a knife's edge between victory and death. Redirecting lightning at the top of Ashina Castle is utterly imprinted onto my memory, nothing else can compare. Anyway, I've been quietly glad to see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has encouraged people (who'd be otherwise turned off by the secret sauce of 'Sekiro is a rhythm game, actually') to start feeling that beat—including our own video producer Midas Whittaker, who invited myself and hardware writer Jess Kinghorn to wax lyrical about how cool and sexy and hot we all …",

So small, in fact, that there was a whole discourse earlier this year about how miniscule the studio is. That lasted right up until another discourse (possibly part of the same discourse) that Sandfall Interactive is actually not that small at all. It was, without a shadow of a doubt, the most annoying debate the industry engaged in this year. Yet regardless of how small or large Sandfall Interactive is, CEO Guillaume Broche isn't interested in making the studio any bigger. Speaking to Edge (via GamesIndustry ) Broche explained that he's more interested in making games than bulking out the team. \"I think it's good to have limitations when you're creative,\" Broche told Edge. \"We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves.\" Broche added that expanding the studio would mean more time spent managing it, which isn't what interests him about game development. \"We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep do…",

The sticker depicts a soldier aiming down the sight of an assault rifle. Upon closer inspection, however, the assault rifle clearly has two barrels, leading Willcario and other Battlefield 6 fans to suspect the sticker art is AI-generated. Accidental replication is certainly an error common among AI-generated images, as anyone who has seen AI-generated pictures of humans with far too many fingers will understand. That said, this image is the only evidence Willcario cites, meaning the mistake could potentially be down to human error. Nonetheless, Willcario makes his thoughts clear about the apparent use of generative AI. \"I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI-generated garbage,\" they say. \"You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI-generated rewards won with them.\" Willcario is referring to Act…",

One question put to Kojima ( timestamp ) relates to Metal Gear Solid 2, saying that AI control in the world is \"becoming a reality\" and asking whether Kojima predicted this era. To sum up in a sentence, and obviously spoilers ahead, MGS2 takes a very weird turn in its second half, with 'reality' collapsing around the protagonist Raiden as the player sits through a series of monologues about digital control, junk data, and our inability to parse the bewildering amounts of information created by the modern world. And that's simplifying things. \"MGS2 is often mistaken for a story about AI, but it's about digital society,\" says Kojima. \"MGS1 was about DNA. What isn't left in DNA are memes.

Numerous game developers offered their perspectives on the issue. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth's director Naoki Hamaguchi stated there is \"definitely a need for that kind of thing\" in games, even if players don't like it, while The Witcher 4's lead designer believed the problem \"isn't necessarily the yellow paint\", but the context in which it was used, and that level designers needed to \"properly weaponise the entire arsenal of your toolkit\" to prevent players from realising that \"'oh, I'm being guided'\". Personally, I think it's easy to criticise developers for whipping out the paintbrush when more subtly guided level design becomes trickier to achieve.
