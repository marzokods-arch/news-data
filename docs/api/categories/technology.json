Since the first crew arrived on Nov. 2, 2000, NASA and its partners have conducted thousands of research investigations and technology demonstrations to advance exploration of the Moon and Mars and benefit life on Earth. Researchers have taken advantage of the unique microgravity environment to conduct experiments impossible to replicate on Earth, transforming research across disciplines. More than 4,000 experiments have pushed the boundaries of science, sparked discoveries, and driven scientific breakthroughs. &#8220;25 years ago, Expedition 1 became the first crew to call the International Space Station home, beginning a period of continuous human presence in space that still continues to this day,” said NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy. “This historic milestone would not have been possible without NASA and its partners, as well as every astronaut and engineer who works to keep the lights on in low Earth orbit.” To celebrate a quarter century of inno…",

We’ve confirmed that AirDrop can also now send files from an iPhone directly to a Pixel 10 as well, bringing true cross-platform sharing to the table. So if your friend has an iPhone, they can follow the exact same AirDrop steps they would use to send a file to another Apple device. Your Pixel 10 will show up in their AirDrop list, and the transfer goes through normally.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android Automotive is powering next-generation Subaru cars, starting with the 2026 Outback. The Google operating system adds support for Google Assistant and other services without needing a connected smartphone. The Android Automotive-based platform retains compatibility with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Many automakers are deciding whether to integrate platforms like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay into their vehicles, or to build their own in-house software. General Motors, for example, is about to ditch Android Auto and CarPlay on its future cars. Then, there’s Tesla, the company that built a custom infotainment system but is now reportedly considering adding CarPlay anyway. Another wrinkle is Android Automotive, the Google operating system that runs on cars independently of a connected smartphone. Subaru confirmed its next-generation infotainment system will use Android Automotive, supporting Android Auto and CarPlay, and it just shared key details and specs. Subaru’s new infotainment system will feature access to Google services without a connected smartphone, Subaru said in a press release this week (via 9to5Google ). The automaker doesn’t mention Android Au…",
