Its next season will make sweeping changes to how monsters fight back and how players customize their gear, and there's even more reworks coming in its next expansion. A big question that has come up as the game transforms yet again, is how often this is going to happen, and if it will continue for the foreseeable future. Speaking in an interview with Diablo streamer Raxxanterax , associate game director Zaven Haroutunian touched on this concern. \"The intention is not to replace everything just because we can,\" he said. Instead, the team tries to get a \"holistic picture of the whole game,\" and look at \"what is not pulling its weight, what is not helping support the player experience in a positive way.\" Haroutunian says monster types were one of the things that went untouched since the game launched and that they needed to be redone before a dungeon with leaderboards could be added. The Tower dungeon coming in the next season relies on the new monster types to gauge your completion progress, encouraging you to seek out tougher enemies for more points—something that just wouldn't work wit…",

Blueprints are one of the rarest drops in Arc Raiders , as they unlock the ability to craft weapons permanently instead of waiting for them to show up in the shop. The Anvil is a great blueprint to secure early on thanks to the gun's high damage and its Arc armor-penetrating heavy ammo. It's like carrying a pocket Ferro that you don't have to reload after every shot. Because blueprint spawns are somewhat random, there's no surefire place to get an Anvil blueprint. There are, however, raider containers that have a high chance of containing weapon blueprints. Thanks to the investigative work of the community, these caches can be tracked down with consistency. Where I found the Anvil blueprint I found the Anvil blueprint in a convenient hidey hole on Dam Battlegrounds that seems to always spawn raider containers. The raider cache spawns in a gap under where the raised highway on Dam Battlegrounds ends. The spot is between Raider Outpost East and East Broken Bridge. All credit goes to Reddit user Cheap-Protection6372 , who found this reproducible loot bounty and decided to share it with the rest of us. Here's where you'll find it: …",

Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: Put off installing Arc Raiders, but was finally convinced to take the plunge by those cool leaping bug bots . What's maddening is that New World itself was not a failure. It was a beneficiary of the early pandemic boom in online gaming, hitting a wild Steam concurrents peak of 913,634 after it launched in 2021. The MMO settled into much lower numbers by early 2022, but was far from a flop, and got an expansion in 2023 and a console port in 2024.

That's the overarching vibe, at least. But there are other things Arc Raiders makes abundantly clear. For instance: the Leaper. Embark Studios could have named this four-legged, spidery walking robot, one of the first truly serious threats you'll encounter on the surface, anything. Marauder. Devastator. Wriggler. Chuckles. I assume the studio went with Leaper because it did not need to get fancy to make these particular robots seem imposing. All Embark's writers needed to do was imagine what someone would shout after seeing a robot the size of a winnebago jump the length of a football field to pulp their friend who just made a little too much noise prying open a rusty dumpster.

Rumors of WoW coming to consoles have happened before, but they've never really lined up this well with what's happening elsewhere in the industry.

It's not the only multiplayer game boasting huge player counts at the moment, either. Battlefield 6 managed a massive 747,000 concurrent players earlier in the month, off the back of a mostly-well-received launch. Of course, there's no one single reason why both of these games attracted so many players to their respective worlds. Battlefield 6 is the latest entry in a long and storied series, whereas Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter formula and refined it down to an easy to learn, hard to master point, to name just two.

The question is, of course, at what point does lower latency become undetectable to human senses? According to MCHOSE itself, the 16 kHz version of the Ace 68 Turbo only improves latency over the (presumably cheaper) 8 KHz variant by 0.02 ms, with the Turbo sitting at 0.06 ms rather than 0.08 ms. So, we are talking about hundredths of a millisecond. Can anyone actually feel that? Cue an army of twitch gamers pointing out the huge benefits of 8 kHz mice and how they couldn't possibly slum it with—eugh!—a 4 KHz rodent. Or whatever. Likewise, it wasn't that long ago that the idea of a, say, 500 Hz monitor seemed a bit silly. Surely anything beyond about 240 Hz was beyond human perception?

It came about when the interview's host, Brad Gerstner, mentioned that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang had said that there was almost zero chance of there being a 'compute glut' within the next couple of years (and by that, he means an excess of AI GPUs). \"The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power,\" replied Nadella. \"It’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power.

    "body": "The $55 billion buyout of EA —the largest leveraged buyout in private equity history —has plunged the future of the corporation into uncertainty. It's gotta find some way to deal with the $20 billion of debt its buyers have lumbered it with, and some fear that its new owners—featuring Saudi Arabia's Public Investment fund and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners—might put the kibosh on diversity and representation in games like The Sims (which would, per one of the series' original leads, be something of a death knell for it ). Well, EA is trying to allay some of those fears (via Polygon ). In a new FAQ for employees from October 30, the company promised that it was still \"in a strong financial position\" despite the small matter of $20 billion in debt and that it will \"maintain creative control\" over its projects even in its new era of private ownership. It also promises to maintain \"a thoughtful, steady approach to AI,\" after stories circulated about the new owners planning to make heavy use of the tech . What does that mean in practice? Your guess is as good as mine. \"The Consortium believes in our vision,\" says EA, referring to its new owners, \"our leadership and the strength of o…",

So why am I fiddling around with random crap in my inventory so much, like toasters, scanners, and cat beds ? On top of these oddities, I also need to store actual gear, like guns, shields, and ammo (I'm saving my best stuff for the right time , of course, and don't lie, you are too). The problem is, this all takes up so much space. No matter how much I feverishly increase my stash size, it'll inevitably fill up again after just a few rounds. I'm fighting a never-ending war with my inner hoarder—something I think we all have in extraction games. Well, that was until I realised that your inventory has a few tricks up its sleeve to cut down on clutter. Something that really helped me was the merge stacks button, which, I'll admit, took me way too long to realise even existed. When you're back in Speranza, just open up your inventory and you'll see the option to the right of the category filter. What this will do is automatically stack any loose items that might be lying around in your stash, taking up unnecessary space. Ammo is the biggest culprit of this, where you might have multiple small stacks of…",

With terrifying Arc robots and potentially even other players gunning for you, you've got to have the tools to defend yourself. That's why you want one of the best weapons . By nature of it being an extraction shooter, however, it's not a matter of simply equipping the best gun in your loadout and venturing out topside. No, you'll have to find, craft, or buy higher-quality weapons. That takes time, and you can always lose them in a matter of seconds. With that in mind, below, I'll recommend the best weapons for each 'stage' of Arc Raiders, beginning with the strongest cheap weapons, and moving all the way up to the rarest, which aren't necessarily the best in all situations. Generally, if you lose a shootout against other players, it's probably more so down to your strategy and positioning than your gear, as most high-end guns are designed to improve versatility or handling over pure DPS. Best Arc Raiders early-game weapons These are the kinds of weapons that you either get heaps of in free loadouts or are so dirt cheap to craft or buy that you won't shed a tear when you lose them…",

However, a technology licensing firm is now claiming that AMD's designs have been achieved thanks to its patented ideas, and it's suing the chip giant for \"its extensive and unauthorized use of [the firm's] semiconductor portfolio.\" The company in question is Adeia, and it announced the lawsuits in a recent press release . Technology licensing isn't something new, of course, and it's been around for as long as chips have. The same is true of intellectual property (IP) lawsuits, but there are a few things that make this move more newsworthy than others. Adeia is claiming that \"AMD infringes ten patents from Adeia's semiconductor intellectual property (IP) portfolio—seven patents covering hybrid bonding technology and three patents covering advanced process node technology.\" An example of one such patent can be read here , filed in 2018 and granted in 2020.…",

While I haven't delved as deeply as Morgan, I've likewise been bedazzled by its sumptuous survival adventure through a vast underground facility and branching pocket dimensions. Following the 1.0 launch, Deep Field Games could easily have clocked out from their years-long shift at the GATE Cascade Research Facility. Instead, they've been burning the midnight oil, supplementing their energy with cans of sugary Pop Snarkle and nourishing alien soup. The result is a beefy new update for Abiotic Factor that adds whole new ways to enjoy and/or suffer through its Half-Life-inspired science maze. Primarily, the 1.1 update adds two new modes—Hardcore mode and Iron mode. Hardcore Mode is, frankly, ridiculous, forcing Abiotic Factor's 'Apocalyptic' difficulty setting with the added challenge of losing everything if you die.

Your job is to figure out which letters are real and which aren't. There's a checklist you can refer to that helps narrow it down. Is the letter addressed to a real person or department?
