And while platforms like Midjourney have allowed you to share your AI creations with others, the new Sora app takes things one step further — it allows you to add your own face and voice to the video. So how does Sora achieve this bizarre feat and what’s it like to use? I installed it to find out.",

The AMP is essentially the Australian album of the year, and is selected by a music industry panel for its artistry, over commercial success. In addition to a trophy, the winner collects a A$50,000 check. “I feel so awesome,” she said on the ABC’s News Breakfast. “Nothing like this has ever happened to me. It’s kind of crazy, but it’s really awesome.” Even to be shortlisted was “so flattering. But no, I didn’t expect this to happen.” The AMP win is just the starting point for what should be a thrilling ride for the 26-year-old.

If approved by the judge overseeing the case, the settlement would resolve the lawsuit Epic filed in 2020 to challenge Google’s stranglehold on Android app distribution. As part of the agreement, Google plans to make sweeping changes to Android, which will be implemented in a future version of next year’s Android 17 release. The company is developing a new system that will allow users to easily install third-party app stores, reducing the friction of getting apps from outside of Google Play. This timing is notable, as next year is also when Android’s new developer verification requirements will go into effect. Beginning in September 2026, Android will block users from installing apps made by unverified developers. Although Google says that sideloading isn’t going anywhere, some critics are concerned this change will kill alternative app stores like F-Droid . That’s why Google’s agreement with Epic has sparked hope that Android’s sideloading restrictions will be eased or eliminated entirely next year.",

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

The company says it’s preparing to launch a phone in the market too, which will likely be the Fairphone Gen 6. Fairphone handsets are currently available in the US via distribution partner Murena, albeit with a Google-free Android skin. The US isn’t exactly the most competitive smartphone market in the world, largely due to a dearth of manufacturers in the country. Nothing is the most recent entrant in the market, but another brand has just announced its own entry. Fairphone has confirmed to Reuters that it has entered the US market. The company isn’t debuting with its Fairphone smartphones, though, as it’s choosing to launch the Fairbuds XL repairable headphones as its first product in the country. This will be sold in the US as part of a partnership with Amazon.",

But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too. Good for them, but hey, ho, hey, I’m here, waving my Material 3 Expressive Pixel. Can I also get some acknowledgment, please?",
