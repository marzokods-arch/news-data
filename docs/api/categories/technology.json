A few years ago, taking an Android phone into an area without cell service meant you were completely cut off — unable to text friends, family, or even emergency services. Today, however, you wouldn’t be so disconnected thanks to satellite connectivity , a feature that links your phone directly to satellites orbiting Earth. Google introduced platform support for satellite connectivity in last year’s Android release, though the feature was initially limited to emergency messaging. The technology has advanced significantly since then, however, paving the way for features like WhatsApp calling and live location sharing even without cellular coverage.",

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage.

Tech gifts are especially tricky at this stage, with budgets tight and the techie in your life probably already well-stocked in most departments. That’s why we have rounded up a handful of last-minute tech gift ideas that come in under $100 at current prices and don’t necessarily rely on knowing someone’s exact setup. Several of these are the kind of gifts that still make sense even if the recipient already owns something similar, such as a smart light or a useful accessory they didn’t realize they needed. They’re practical, a little bit fun, and easy to slot into everyday life. And yes, a few of them would also make perfectly reasonable “accidental” gifts to yourself.",

New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",

I want a single device that can swap out my paperback, take notes as responsively as an old-school notepad, and handle a modern digital workflow without breaking a sweat. It sounds simple enough. We’ve had E-Ink readers for years, and we have had tablets for even longer. The logical endpoint, the holy grail, would be a fast and fluid color E-Ink reader. Imagine a screen that can render comic books in full color, handle highlighting for PDFs, and manage color-coded calendars, all while giving me the benefits of all-out sunlight readability and battery life.

Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.

This feature automatically saves your chats and allows you to access your sessions across devices. This joins other NotebookLM additions like Gemini integration and upgraded custom chat prompts. NotebookLM is one of the more useful AI services today, allowing you to create a virtual notebook from your own sources and offering podcast-style Audio Overviews. Google has slowly been rolling out chat history functionality, and it’s now available to all. Google confirmed via the NotebookLM Twitter account that the chat history feature is now available to all users on mobile and the web. That means you now have a persistent chat history across platforms, allowing you to start a session on mobile and then continue on the web (or vice versa).",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We spotted that Google is testing a less intrusive placement for the Remix button in Google Messages after user complaints. The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

There’s no getting around the fact that you are feeding an immense amount of deeply personal information, from journal entries to sensitive work emails, into a black box owned by trillion-dollar corporations. What could go wrong? Now, there’s no going back from AI, but there are use cases for it where it can work as a productivity multiplier. And that’s why I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of researching local AI . If you’re not familiar with the concept, it’s actually fairly simple. It is entirely possible to run a large language model, the brains behind a tool like ChatGPT, right off your computer or even a phone.

    "summary": "New data shows mobile networks often far outperform airport Wi-Fi, with one carrier leading the way.",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Ookla data shows Verizon delivered the fastest mobile download speeds at many major US airports. Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

You know that the situation is bad when a company’s own status page is itself generating an error message, as is the case with Spotify’s right now. Over on Reddit , threads going back about an hour now describe users being unable to access Spotify streams, and on X Spotify confirmed at 8:45a ET that it was “aware of some issues right now and … checking them out.”",
