One topic I wanted to get their thoughts on was optimization: Defect looks like a heavy game, but has surprisingly lenient specs⁠—RTX 2060 minimum⁠—and no mandatory ray tracing like we're starting to see in some games. The graphics arms race is proving ever more costly for devs and players, with diminishing returns: The cutting edge Metal Gear Solid Delta left me feeling cold, especially compared to the similarly photorealistic, yet more vibrant, striking, and ten years older Phantom Pain. Meanwhile, people's champions like Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6 are scoring points with players by not just running on lower-end hardware, but looking and performing well . This isn't just a question of tech and optimization, according to Palalic.\"Good performance in a game isn't always a technical problem, it's as much of an art problem as well,\" he told me. \"A really strong art team can work within any shading and rendering limitations that are presented and lean into those.

As reported by The Game Post , which also shared the details on the original story about the fan revival, Sony has allegedly started cracking down on gameplay videos of the undead hero shooter. The Game Post article states that multiple videos uploaded by the team behind the revival have received DMCA strikes from MarkScan, a digital asset protection firm that has swung the enforcer bat for Sony in the past . The article also relays a message from the project devs on Discord: \"Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.\" It doesn't sound like Sony has come directly for the team or its fan revival at the time of writing, but this indicates it's likely already on the studio's radar and may not be long for this world.

In fact, it's still pretty bumpy: the launch is rife with problems. The Steam debut, which coincides with Escape From Tarkov's 1.0 release , has helped the game rocket to the top of Downdetector , which is showing hundreds of reported connection issues per hour beginning this morning. The user reviews on Steam are bringing the game's score to a \"Mixed\" rating as players describe their issues logging in. As user Icedecknight put it in their review : \"Negative review until I can actually play the game.\" The official Tarkov account on X has acknowledged the launch woes, noting in a post that the team is \"aware that due to high traffic, some players may experience problems connecting to servers and authorising in the game and launcher.

It's as simple as that—just watch out one of them doesn't try and steal your wallet while you're doing it. And just to get ahead of it: don't be coming at me with any \"technically that's not a goblin\" nonsense. I know one when I see one.

So while chatting with Dogubomb developer Tonda Ros this week, I naturally wanted to know what was coming next. With so many games being made into movies and TV shows, and since Blue Prince is so densely packed with stories and mysteries (some of which still haven't been fully uncovered yet ), I asked Ros if he'd been approached about a film adaptation. Might we see Blue Prince the movie someday? \"I have been approached, and I regret to tell the fans that it is not something I'm currently considering. To me, Blue Prince is this one game or this one piece of art in the medium of games. And so I couldn't really imagine it as anything else,\" Ros said. \"I'm a filmmaker myself. And before dabbling in game dev one of my dreams [was] to make a feature film. I have a lot of aspirations in that front, but I do think that each of my projects will be completely standalone.

Not official Concord, no, but a fan-fired effort to make the game playable again: As first reported by The Game Post , a small group has been working on the project for months, and full matches are now playable on customer servers. \"The project is still WIP,\" developer Red said on the Concord Delta Discord . \"It's playable, but buggy.\" The team shared a video of one of the test matches today on YouTube. It's not the most pro-tier shooter action I've ever seen, but yeah, that's definitely Concord.

That's just as long as those updates actually get downloaded and installed, though, which wasn't happening for some due to two errors (via Windows Latest ). These errors have now been patched, though, according to Windows Latest , citing a statement from Microsoft. The KB5071959 update should fix the issue. Microsoft says : \"This update addresses an issue in the Windows 10 Consumer Extended Security Update (ESU) enrollment process, where the enrollment wizard may fail during enrollment. After applying this update, consumer devices should be able to successfully enroll in ESU using the ESU wizard.\" Windows Latest explains that people in the EU were unable to enroll in the update program and were told it's \"coming soon\" and is \"temporarily unavailable in your region\", even when the option to \"enroll now\" showed up.

That doesn't mean there isn't something to catch your eye, though, and an announcement from Adata and MSI, as well as a rumour about SK hynix, is great news for anyone who wants to go absolutely ham with RAM. Starting with the joint venture between Adata and MSI , a new DDR5 module is set to appear on the market that is certainly going to be snapped up by anyone who needs as much RAM as possible in their PCs, without sacrificing performance. AMD and Intel's latest top-end desktop platforms (i.e. X870E and Z890) support up to 256 GB of RAM. However, to reach this amount, you normally have to buy four 64 GB DIMMs, filling every slot on the motherboard. When you do that, you're typically forced to use the memory's lowest speed (e.g. 4800 MT/s), which isn't ideal for something like high-resolution video editing. The answer to this is Adata and MSI's 4-rank DDR5 modules. Where most DIMMs have just one or two ranks of memory, these sticks will be so loaded with DRAM modules that each one will offer up to 128 GB of capacity. Not only that, they'll be rated to run…",

This mission is a four-parter where Tian Wen asks you to investigate two specific locations in the facility and deliver two items to her, one rare and one epic. It's a tall order, to be honest. Since grabbing both items in this quest is primarily based on RNG, I'd suggest you bring a safe pocket with which to store either should you strike lucky. Despite having good loot, Stella Montis feels like a pretty friendly map at the moment, as players fight through so many Arc that they barely have time to kill each other. All that said, here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders. Take a photo of any of the Rovers in the Sandbox You can find the Rovers in the Sandbox area on the bottom layer of Stella Montis (Image credit: Embark Studios) This first step is very easy to complete. Simply head to the lower layer of Stella Montis and find the Sandbox near the center of the map—you might have to zoom in for it to appear.

So it shouldn't really be a surprise that I'm excited for the prospect of custom Steam Machine launch screens. For those unaware, if you have a video file in the right resolution and format, SteamOS allows you to use it as a boot screen—it can be anything you choose. And naturally, people have already got to work on boot screens tailored to the upcoming Steam Machine. In particular, this GabeCube one posted by Redditor DentureTaco will surely be a go-to. The 'GabeCube' meme is already a little overused but frankly, I don't care. It's too good not to use, and this faux GameCube animation is fantastic. That staple Valve audio at the end sends nostalgic shivers down my spine, too. That SteamOS lets you change its bootup screen shouldn't be a massive shock given it's a Linux operating system, and these famously let you…",
