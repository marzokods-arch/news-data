Armstrong says it's all down to a proportion of the PC playerbase who still have hard disk drives (HDD) rather than solid-state drives (SSD). His full explanation follows but, essentially, Arrowhead duplicates a tonne of information in order to make the game load faster for those on HDDs (which matters because no match starts until all players have loaded the mission, regardless of hardware). \"An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data,\" says Armstrong ( thanks, VGC ). \"The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. \"To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.

We've slurped down Brotato, Halls of Torment, Soulstone Survivors, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, but it doesn't sound like we're even close to done. The good news is that there's always another one, ready to usher us into more maps where we can saunter around slaughtering everything with a face—and some things without—with our increasingly ridiculous screen-clearing attacks. Right now that would be Megabonk , which launched a couple of weeks ago and has been bounding up Steam's top-selling games list. It's a goofy, 3D Vampire Survivors-like with sword-surfing (which seems to be having a moment, judging by Metaphor Re:Fantazio and Sword of the Sea), cool skeletons and wild builds. This week saw it climb into the seventh spot in the global chart, significantly higher than last month's major releases: Borderlands 4, Dying Light: The Beast and Hollow Knight: Silksong.
