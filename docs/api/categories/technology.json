And yet there are several unambiguous signs that the Arm revolution on the PC may well be imminent. Yes, for real this time. What's more, modern Arm CPUs look very compelling on paper. When it comes to single-core performance, all the indications are that they are actually superior to x86. And single-core performance is particularly important for gaming. Anyway, if the Snapdragon X has been a disappointment, that's perhaps as much down to unrealistic expectations as it is any failings of Snapdragon X or Arm CPUs more generally. In other words, if Arm is to take a big chunk of the PC market, or even overtake x86, that is never going to happen overnight.

The problem is, I've been utterly spoilt for choice this year. As well as officially reviewing numerous mice, ergonomic keyboards, motherboards, RAM kits, processors, and all kinds of other hardware, I've also used a range of PC products for testing game performance and just as part of my collection of test rigs in the office. Some of them I've bought myself, others have been kindly provided by hardware companies (and let me take this opportunity to directly thank MSI, Asus, and Corsair on that note). (Image credit: Future) Absolutely none of it has been rubbish. Even the products that didn't get a high review score still had some feature to make them stand out a bit from the crowd, or offered something special for the right user.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. For all its efforts to streamline the extraction shooter genre and make a game that anyone can pick up and play even a year down the line, Arc Raiders has some hidden complexities. Since launch, we've been pushing the game to its limits and have already discovered a number of odd quirks. While some make sense if you really think about it, most of them you'd never have guessed. Whether it's cheeky movement tech that'll give you a leg up Topside, skills not quite functioning how they should (or just being very weak), or the confusing way friendly fire works, it's all useful information to have stored in your brain. But not every tip you hear from other players is true. Below, I've picked a handful of Arc Raiders myths, and you'll have to figure out which ones are true and which are false. And if you guess wrong, you'll learn some surprisingly handy facts that'll keep you breathing next time you go to the surface, so it's a win-win.",

The reaction was much different to the one in Japan, Chief Producer Yohsuke Uda tells me. When I asked whether the team thought it was down to cultural differences, he agreed. \"There may be some nuances that were lost in translation when we did that,\" he said. \"So it was definitely interesting, or rather surprising, when we went to Anime Expo [in Los Angeles], and when Subway Slammer appeared on the screen, a lot of people were cheering for him.\" (Image credit: SEGA) I do have to wonder whether or not that was the team's first exposure to how heavily clowned upon the Subway Slammer was—I would sure as hell be confused if I were in their shoes.

And, even as someone who has literally never sat atop a horse, I have no shame in admitting that I was the first to fall. However, if you haven't noticed your gaming library or day-to-day life becoming infected with these powerful beasts, it's probably because you haven't realised just how significant horses have been. Because I'm not talking about the games that are basically ranch simulators for the most part. Although they have had their time in the spotlight, with the full launch of The Ranch of Rivershine, Barbie Horse Trails, and Sound of Horses, it's more so a plethora of updates and expansions that have put a particular emphasis on horses, which has led me to believe that 2025 has been the y…",

And no, I'm not talking about unreasonably high refresh rates on monitors—although the ones from Asus I saw at Gamescom did impress me, whether OLED or TN —I'm talking about peripherals. On the mouse front, we've had a big leap in how light a sturdy wireless gaming mouse can go with the 36 g Corsair Sabre V2 Pro . But then there's what a mouse sits atop: the humble mouse pad. I can't say I thought my years of testing and writing about PC gaming hardware would lead to writing so much about a mouse pad, but here we are: My favourite piece of 'hardware' from this year was a mouse pad. The pad in question, the SteelSeries QcK Performance , isn't just your run-of-the-mill mat, though. Hear me out.

The Linux hype this time was precipitated by Valve's Linux-based operating system, SteamOS, opening up for use on other handhelds than just the Steam Deck . That had been long on the cards , but it finally started seeming close at hand early on this year. SteamOS has shown what Linux can be capable of for gaming in large part because of Proton , the compatibility layer Valve employs to translate Windows commands into ones that Linux can understand. It's a fork of WINE tailored towards gaming, created and maintained by Valve specifically for that purpose. Over the years, Proton has gotten so good that compatible games tend to run flawlessly. Valve has an incentive to ensure this is the case, as a great gaming experience on SteamOS via Proton makes for more Steam Deck and Steam Store sales. The development and improvement of …",

Until Larian unveiled Divinity, we didn't know what it was doing next—only that it wouldn't be Baldur's Gate 4. At GDC 2024, about nine months after BG3's release, Larian boss Swen Vincke dropped a bombshell: The studio would not make an expansion pack or sequel to its most successful game to date, and was parting ways with Wizards of the Coast and D&D entirely.

After a bit of semi-philosophical musing on the question of whether Shepard is alive following the events of Mass Effect 3 (spoiler: well, maybe ), Hale invited fans to \"email the powers-that-be who make these games and say, 'Give us more Shepard, please'.\" \"Because we will be there, because we should not go,\" Hale says. \"I would be there with bells on if they asked us to play Shepard again.\" \"I agree,\" Meer then chimes in with faux seriousness, \"but only under any circumstances.\" It could happen. BioWare made a point of offing Shepard at the start of Mass Effect 2 , and insisted that it was really for real—but then of course he was brought back to life by the Lazarus Project so he could save us all from the Reaper threat. Classic hero stuff. If it can happen once, it…",

And between 2004 and 2018, it released 12 games, eight of which absolutely belong in every RPG lover's library. We're talking Alpha Protocol, Neverwinter Nights 2, New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, Tyranny, and yes, even South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's an incredible list of games, and while some of them are looking a bit long in the tooth these days, I can't bring myself to not recommend every single one of them—and that's not just because PCG news writer Josh Wolens would curse me if I badmouthed Alpha Protocol. Since 2018, though? Things haven't been so great. (Image credit: Obsidian) The Outer Worlds and its sequel, along with Avowed, have plenty of defenders. They reviewed well— including here —and have their fans. But they're missing what made Obsidian's previous games so absurdly compelling: the best-in-class writing, the big risks and quests that stick with me years later. It feels like its acquisition by Microsoft has taught it to be cautious and boring, just like its risk-averse owner. But it's wild that its biggest swings happened …",

Sadly, festive first-person shooters are thin on the ground for some inexplicable reason. But as is so often the case, the FPS community has filled this smoking bullet-hole left by developers, decking PC gaming's gore-spattered halls with boughs of holly through the power of mods. To help fellow FPS-heads get into the Christmas spirit, I've put together a roundup of the best Christmas-themed mods for PC gaming's most renowned shooters (plus one additional stocking filler that I think should be brought to your attention). I've also assigned them a festivity rating (scored, appropriately, out of twelve) to give you some sense of just how much Yuletide cheer they cram down the barrel.

So far, I haven't been disappointed. We've seen numerous key locations in just the first couple of episodes, like Vault 24 and the Starlight Drive-In . And now, in the second episode, we've had a magnificent look at Area 51, as it was unveiled after the Brotherhood got its hands on cold fusion. (Image credit: Prime TV) The showrunners again proved how dedicated they are to depicting the Wasteland with care, a fact that executive producer Todd Howard raised during my interview: \"I always view the biggest character being the world. I think everybody involved with the show has taken such amazing care to treat locations with this obsessive authenticity. And I think that's what people like, and it's all practical, or most of it, right? More so than other shows or movies. \"They built so much of it. You walk on set,…",

It wasn't just me: a bunch of us at PC Gamer, movie fans and Witcher fans alike, missed it too. It's called The Rats: A Witcher Tale , a feature-length special that serves as a prequel to Season 4, and you can watch it right now on Netflix—though judging from evidence I'm about to present, I'm not sure Netflix really wants you to. Exhibit A: Netflix didn't do a heck of a lot to tell people about this movie. I get mail from Netflix in both my professional and personal inboxes, and they sent nothing about this special. Zilch. I also have an account on a Netflix press site that has absolutely zero mention of it. Odd. Weirder still, I searched the official YouTube channel and there's no trailer or even a teaser for it.
