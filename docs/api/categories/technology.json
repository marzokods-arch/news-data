So if the prices here don't match up when you read this, that's likely why. We recommend using a price checker tool, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you're still getting a good deal. I think I've tested every single combination of controller and NAND flash found in all of the top-end PCIe 5.0 SSDs at this point. At least all of them, trying to match or break parity with Sandisk's WD SN8100 , that is, all pinching a little bit of the drive's tech while they do it. Yet this is the first SSD I've found that kind of does manage to do that, yet in a very weird, roundabout way. This latest batch of Kingston Fury Renegade G5 drives, including this particularly boisterous 8 TB unit we have on display here, touts exactly the same NAND flash and controller combo as found in the SN8100. But, of course, all dressed up in a Kingston skirt. And I'll be frank, it works really, really well. Arguably unsurprisingly, given it's the same hardware combo that catapulted the SN8100 into our best SSD list. It's been well documented at this point …",

Alright, I'll come out and say it, the Lexar NQ780 is a bit average. A bit dull. Usually, when it comes to reviewing hardware like this, particularly SSDs, there's always something to write about. Something that's slightly interesting, or some weird quirk that the manufacturer has tweaked a certain way that's led to some curious performance metric in one manner or another. With the NQ780, though, that's kind of not the case. It's interesting, sort of, in its own way, because it's not really that interesting. In a world of blisteringly quick PCIe 5.0 drives like the SN8100 , intuitive new controller designs, limit-breaking NAND flash technologies with a quadrillion layers up-down, left and right, the NQ780 just kind of exists.

One person who isn't quite so pessimistic, though, is the CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna. Krishna recently spoke with Nilay Patel, EIC of The Verge, on the Decoder podcast and sounded optimistic about the future of AI—which is, to my ears at least, quite refreshing, even if I don't agree on all points. In particular, although he does explicitly say \"no\", we're not in an AI bubble, his explanation, at least on my listening, doesn't seem to completely rule out this possibility; rather, it explains how such things aren't all-or-nothing. I say this is \"refreshing\" just because of how one-dimensional a lot of AI talk can be: either 'AI sucks and the bubble's going to burst' or 'AI is an amazing innovation that will revolutionise everything.'

In any other year by 2025, news that a memory company is apparently investing approximately $540 billion in the construction of four new manufacturing plants would be viewed with shock and suspicion. That's because such a sum of money is way more than the typical cost of that many RAM foundries. And yet, this is exactly what SK hynix is doing, according to a report from the Seoul Economic Daily (via Jukan on X ). With approximately 35% of the DRAM market , SK hynix is second only to Samsung, and over the past 12 months, it's been steadily eating away at its South Korean rival's lead.

Not too long ago, Logitech revised its longstanding low-profile keyboard lineup with a new G915 X Lightspeed model and the cheaper G515 Lightspeed TKL option, both of which I've looked at in the past. Both of those keyboards were in the Swiss brand's more traditional wheelhouse, opting for a conventional low-profile switch, plus creature comforts such as solid build quality and fast wireless connectivity. The all-new G515 Rapid TKL isn't in that wheelhouse, though. Its switches are no longer standard low-profile mechanical ones, and instead are low-profile magnetic analogue ones. That means all the fun of rapid trigger and its clever software trickery into an already short and snappy travel. I'll get to those switches in a minute. As I mentioned a minute ago, this keyboard is an example of the Logitech-flavoured cake being given to you but not consumed, in that it sacrifices any form of wireless connectivity.

Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn.

    "body": "Is the tide finally turning for Intel? After news that the chip maker has convinced Apple to make its \"M\" branded silicon at Intel's foundry , and data showing that Intel Arc GPUs have established a (tiny) foothold in the graphics market , comes a comment from a leading industry analyst. Patrick Moorehead claims Intel's upcoming next-gen 14A node is the \"real deal.\" Moorhead is the eponymous boss of Moor Insights and Strategy , a former chip executive and now leading analyst and talking head on countless podcasts and TV news segments. In an analyst note this week, Moorhead first said he was \"bullish\" about Intel's new 18A node, which is in production now and will first be seen in January underpinning Intel's next-gen Panther Lake CPUs . He then explained why things are also looking up for 14A. \"From everything I’ve seen—and all the Intel customers I’ve talked to—I’m very confident that Intel will use 18A to successfully produce tens of millions of leading-edge chips in the Panther Lake family and beyond in the near term. I believe 18A can stack up against any production node in its class in the world, so it really is getting Intel back to industry leadership,\" Moorhead says. The t…",

That thing has been taking an absolute beating over the last year. We've seen very visible effects of this with various memorable outages, but now we've also got some numbers to put to it, in the form of \"hyper-volumetric\" DDoS attacks. Giant content delivery network (CDN) Cloudflare has released some somewhat troubling stats and info regarding the past year of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These are essentially attacks that attempt to flood a target service with packets of data to overload and overwhelm it and prevent it from doing the work it's actually meant to be doing, such as providing an internet connection to customers or displaying webpages. According to Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are up 170% to 36.2 million in 2025 compared to 2024. To zoom in a little, the company says that in the third quarter of 2025, it \"mitigated an average of 3,780 DDoS attacks every hour.\" That's 63 DDoS attacks each minute, or about one every second. Not every DDoS attack is a noteworthy one, of course, but ther…",
