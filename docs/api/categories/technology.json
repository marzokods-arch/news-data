The rebrand didn't last long: after a fierce outcry from people who correctly thought the new logo sucked, Corsair swapped to a refreshed take on the sail logo, which it's been using ever since. Corsair was established in 1994, and made about $1.4 billion last year—which I bring up because today Microsoft, a slightly bigger company, has slipped on its own rebranding banana peel. The company is seemingly all but ditching the Office name—which it introduced four years before Corsair existed, and which drove more than $30 billion in revenue just last quarter —with a catchy new name: \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app.\" Copilot is, notably, a thing that already exists! But as part of the ongoing effort to juice AI assistant usage numbers by making it impossible to not use AI, Microsoft has decided to just call its whole productivity software suite Copilot, I guess.

Beginning production in the winter of 2024, the team slow-cooked a total conversion mod in (semi) secret,\" the announcement reads. \"The community came out in force, producing an unprecedented 77 maps, pushing the limits of the Quake engine to bring the oppressive, gritty, and beautiful aesthetic of brutalism to life.\" The first and second Brutalist Jams were already impressive, but this new one is on another level. It comes bearing all sorts of new weapons, enemies, power ups, 3D art assets, which the release announcement posits is a \"a complete visual overhaul of Quake's existing roster.\" It shows off the goods in a trailer that released yesterday and it's barely recognizable …",

To discover that it ditches the usual shortcomings of Samsung's QD-OLED tech while capitalising on all that characteristic OLED goodness, including perfect per-pixel lighting and incredible speed? Well, there's good reason to think that it might just be a goer. Because this new MSI monitor rocks Samsung's very latest QD-OLED panel technology . MSI is referring to it as \"5th-Gen\" Samsung QD-OLED, which is news to me. I thought the very latest panel tech from Samsung is Gen 4. Likewise, MSI refers to not only \"5th Gen\" but \"5th Gen Tandem OLED\" when describing this panel technology, which leaves me a bit baffled. \"Tandem OLED\" has hitherto been a marketing pitch employed by LG, Samsung's main competitor in the OLED panel manufacturing industry, to describe its own latest WOLED technology. Has someone in MSI marketing department gotten a little over excited when it comes to both the 5th-Gen and the tandem thing? Very possibly.

We're doing everything in shades of gray. It's going to be moral ambiguity and complexity.'\" But another mandate from Sawyer required that the player also have utmost agency: \"The player has to be able to get through this game killing everyone they meet the moment they meet them, and also killing absolutely nothing at all,\" Gonzalez recalled. That's where Yes Man came in. If you haven't played New Vegas, Yes Man is a robot sporting a goofy grin and an inability to decline any command or truly be disposed of.

I'm not a huge fan art guy, but Deimos' work speaks to me—it reimagines this classic game through the lens of fine art, a style that emulates romantic painting, but applied to the side stories and characters of a 2010 RPG. 2281 Overture feels like a particularly illustrative example, showing an NCR-aligned version of the game's final battle with every companion ringed around the Courier (something you can't pull off in an unmodded game).

It's also hard to quibble with promises to improve the performance, graphics, online stability, and VR support. Some players aren't so impressed by the promise to implement a Creator Marketplace for user-generated content, which is to say: paid mods. While you can buy DLC to play games like Zombicide in Tabletop Simulator, the Steam Workshop is where the real action is. It's full of unofficial mods recreating games like Uno and Settlers of Catan , as well as resources like D&D miniatures , a…",

    "body": "Title 17 of the United States Code states that \"in the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication.\" (Or 120 years after its creation, whichever comes first).
