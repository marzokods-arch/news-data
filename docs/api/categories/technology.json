George and French journalist Nico Collard say goodbye to Paris and Templar conspiracies and instead find themselves in South America uncovering a Mayan mystery. George really doesn't know how to take a normal holiday. This updated version will feature 4K art and the return of Broken Sword 1's story mode—a more relaxed mode that gives you a bit of assistance with puzzles, while not feeding you the solution. \"The Smoking Mirror has always been one of our most loved games, and with Reforged we were able to enhance it in ways that respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences\", says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. \"Just as with the first game, we can't wait for players old and new to experience it again.\" I truly adore the Broken Sword series and thought the remaster was pretty much perfect , aside from the slightly tinny audio.

That's not to say I'm calling it here and now that it'll be perfect. It's developer Epictellers Entertainment's first ever game; CRPGs are hard to make; and it's still very, very early days. Starfinder: Afterlight is the first proper videogame to use Starfinder 2e—built upon Pathfinder 2e's framework. So far, Afterlight's developers have been a tad coy. Trailers are mostly (gorgeous-looking) artwork with voiceover layered atop it, and the Steam page only has a few brief stills, so I was curious to see how it looks in motion and, honestly? I think the folks at Epictellers are being a little gunshy. What I saw wasn't terrible at all—the environment, a space cantina bar with flickering neon signs, looks pretty and well-detailed.

The Havn BF 360 is available in either black or white, and I was fortunate to be able to test both colourways for review. Great news for you, dear reader, less so me moving around my small, now very cramped, office. While I am a fan of the white HS 420, the black version is the better-looking of the BF 360 options. That's mostly down to the front panel. Both versions come with speckled, textured front panels—the thing that lured me to these cases when they were first displayed on the Computex showfloor—but the lighter panel looks a lot better in contrast to the black shell. The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis. Havn has even handed me a diagram of all the various prototypes it worked through for where it put the supports for these vents and how it landed on the final design for …",

    "body": "Peter Molyneux, founder of Bullfrog and Lionhead Studios, is notorious for overhyping his games. Back in the day, when I was a lot younger than I am now, this was considered a kind of adorable foible—the guy just got so excited about the stuff he was making he couldn't help but make wild, unfulfillable promises about them. That perception dramatically changed, I reckon, around the time of massively multiplayer Curiosity: What's Inside The Cube . It was a game in which, well, a lot of players all tapped on a cube, removing layer after layer until they eventually hit the centre. Molyneux promised the prize for the single player who reached that centre would be \"life-changing\". It turned out to be the role of 'God of gods' in Molyneux's then-upcoming game Godus, plus 1% of the game's revenue. The winner—an 18-year-old named Bryan Henderson—never got any money, and told Eurogamer that he was largely forgotten by Molyneux's studio after a single visit to its office in 2015. Fast forward to today, and an interview with the most recent issue of Edge magazine, and Molyneux seems contrite about the whole saga, but I don't know that he's learnt the right lessons. Molyneux frames the game as…",

The big news is a top tier of Intel Core Ultra X 300 chips to sit above the regular Core Ultra 300 series. It is only these \"X\" branded chips that will reportedly get Panther Lake's most powerful Xe3 integrated graphics. The full-spec Panther Lake models, therefore, will reportedly be configured with four Performance cores and eight Efficient cores in the CPU chiplet. They will be complemented by a further four Efficient cores in the so-called low-power island on the SoC die for a grand total of 16 CPU cores. According to this new leak, this new upper tier of Panther Lake chips will be branded Intel Core Ultra X300. So, by way of example, the top chip is said to be the Intel Core Ultra 9 X388H. Arguably the most exciting element of the new chip for PC gaming, however, is the new Xe3-spec iGPU, also known as Celestial. The new \"X\" branded models reportedly get 12 graphics cores. That's a significant upgrade from Intel's current most powerful integrated graphics in its Lunar Lake laptop chips .

When it feels like it's drawing to an end it just keeps going , and its protracted runtime is exacerbated by the fact that it's an unbearably tense experience. I adore this game, I swear I do, but boy could it have used a trim. It turns out at least one member of the original dev team agrees. In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",

It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying.

    "body": "Activision's catching tons of cheaters in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 red-handed—that is, if its official news account on X is to be believed. In a blog posted to the site today, Activision boasted some pretty impressive numbers, at least at first glance. \"Cheaters were expected. But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems, helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn’t last long. Most never made it into a match.\" For context, \"TPM 2.0 checks\" refers to the fact that the new Call of Duty requires secure boot and TPM 2.0 to be played on PC —which isn't unique to the game itself. Battlefield 6 also requires secure boot, much to the chagrin of Linux gamers everywhere. In fairness, gamers are reasonably concerned about giving a company kernel-level access to their machines, which, as our own hardware writer Jacob Ridley put it , \"is like administrator [mode] on steroids\". It also shuts out people without TPM on their processors (hence the aforementioned Linux upset). The \"automated systems\" are referring to Ricochet, an anti-cheat system that uses AI—if these nu…",

    "summary": "Are SSDs and memory prices headed the same way as graphics cards?",
    "body": "Painfully high graphics card pricing has become a seemingly permanent norm and at least some of that comes down to the impact of the burgeoning AI boom. Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",
