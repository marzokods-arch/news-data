    "body": "I will admit, I was expecting more from the Corsair One. More heat, more noise, more annoyance. After all, the original Corsair One, while admittedly smol, was a noisy ol' chimney of a PC. But the current design—a bit taller, a bit deeper—is far more suited to the task of keeping both high-end CPU and GPU combinations in check. While that does make the i600 a less compact gaming PC than the first iteration, it is a far more effective device because of it. And it's still pretty small if you compare it to most RTX 5080-based gaming PCs on the market. You can, of course, build out a small form factor mini-ITX machine in something like the Fractal Design Terra and have yourself a powerful micro machine, but it's not going to be able to get close to matching the cooling and aural design of the Corsair One. This thing is pacey, and this thing does it all with an understated grace you'll struggle to match with any compact DIY build. The key to that is the dual 240 mm AIO water cooling loops the Corsair One employs to keep its CPU and GPU components chill. There's a radiator in the top of the chassis that cools the graphics card and one in the side, which folds open, to look after the CPU…",

The publisher has become one of the most prolific—certainly within strategy and management games—with its recent releases including 9 Kings, Cataclismo, Endless Legend 2 and Manor Lords. It's also got good instincts: a significant number of its published games have gone on to be critical and commercial successes. Bender says that as he's scrolling through Steam, \"everything is designed to help me discover games\". I can find it hard to sift through the vast number of games released every month, but to be honest I can't fault the Discovery system: it's always spitting out stuff that's in my wheelhouse. And, to be fair, a lot that isn't. Instead, there's a problem with expectations, he reckons. \"Some people complain about the number of games released or wish for some kind of guaranteed exposure, but store platforms should welcome all entrants and let player preferences guide visibility.

Why? Crandall, who has worked at Kingston for 29 years, says the company is experiencing NAND wafer price spikes the likes of which have never been seen before. In conversation with Mark Hachman on The Full Nerd Network podcast , Crandall got specific, saying there's been \"a 246% increase in NAND pricing as compared to Q1 of 2025.\" He later goes on to elaborate, \"We just recently saw a 70% increase in NAND costs over… I think it was a 60-day period. So, that 250% I mentioned earlier—70% of that was increased within the last 60 days.\" As NAND flash chips make up about 90% of a single SSD's Bill of Materials cost, that's an especially eye-watering uptick for both businesses and general consumers alike. As such, Crandall offers a word of advice to anyone considering upgrading their rig's storage: \"Do it now and [don't] wait, because prices are going to continue to go up.\" In other words, we've yet to see just how high SSD prices can go.

But honestly, all I ever really wanted was a good skin. A nice unique cosmetic was always my primary motivation for doing the Expedition project, not just because of the bragging rights, but because I like cosmetic options in games. Maybe it's the sicko Destiny 2 player in me talking, but character fashion is properly important. With the Expedition rewards announcement that we were getting the \"Patchwork skin\", but with no visual reveal, a lot of players were worried that Embark was referring to a pretty unappealing skin from the server slam. But now the Expedition window has actually opened up and we can see a thumbnail of the outfit, things are looking good .

As you can find out for yourself by opening Steam and clicking the big \" Steam Replay \" button on the storefront, the percentage playtime spent by all Steam users in 2025 on games, released in the same year, was 14%. Valve doesn't share its exact working, here, but I'm happy to assume that the company makes an effort to bar completely inactive accounts in these tallies, because Steam's been kicking for over 22 years at this point—if it didn't, that number would be a lot smaller. I'm also made more reasonably confident by the fact that this is a pattern that's held (somewhat) stable for four years now—with only one outlier in 2023. As we noted last year , the historical data for this same statistic are as follows: Players spent 17% of their time on same-year releases in 2022… 9% in 2023 and 15% in 2024.

The gettings are really good right now, but apparently only on maps with the Cold Snap condition—that's the new one with snow and the mechanic that forces you to stay indoors to not freeze to death. I'm gonna join everyone else in assuming this is either a bug or a temporary, unspoken bonus to encourage players to engage in the deadlier map condition. Either way, it's almost surely temporary.

The Finals outfit is a recolor of the Ryder skin usually earned through the free raider deck. The primary colors are white and red to match The Finals.

In Bloomberg's words, Larian has been \"pushing hard\" on generative AI and its developers \"often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.\" Vincke reiterated in the interview that the studio isn't using generative AI to create any of the art, voices, or writing we see in its games. After the interview was published, he also said that \"pushing hard\" isn't a correct characterization of Larian's AI policy and that AI is not being used \"to develop concept art\" in his view—though it is being used in \"the very early ideation stages.\" Above: Our post-Game Awards interview with Larian about its next RPG .

This insight was shared by Sapphire's Edward Crisler, its North America PR rep and PC gaming evangelist, on the latest edition of the Hardware Unboxed Podcast . Over the hour-long discussion, Crisler and HUB host Tim Schiesser chatted about all things gaming GPU-wise, from the RDNA 4 launch to the current RAM crisis, and even Nvidia's 12VHPWR meltygate power socket. While discussing VRAM and who gets to decide how much a card can have, Crisler said with a smile: \"I got to be careful of what I'm about to say here.

At least one outlet has decided it must be a version of AMD's next-gen \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs based on Zen 6 technology. AMD has already said that Venice's CPU dies will be built on TSMC's upcoming N2 node. So, if that assumption around using Samsung's foundry for the Venice CPU is true, AMD must be looking for a second source. Of course, AMD could be looking to make plenty of other chips on Samsung's new 2 nm node, which is branded SF2P. A good candidate might be an APU for laptops and handhelds, perhaps a successor for its Strix Point chip . Or maybe its next generation of gaming GPUs.
