As lead writer John Gonzales told PC Gamer in an interview with associate editor Ted Litchfield, that's all by design: \"I remember when we were just kicking off the project, [New Vegas lead Josh Sawyer] coming into a conference room and saying, 'Okay, so we're not doing any good or evil, black and white stuff. We're doing everything in shades of gray. It's going to be moral ambiguity and complexity.'\" But another mandate from Sawyer required that the player also have utmost agency: \"The player has to be able to get through this game killing everyone they meet the moment they meet them, and also killing absolutely nothing at all,\" Gonzales recalled. That's where Yes Man came in. If you haven't played New Vegas, Yes Man is a robot sporting a goofy grin and an inability to decline any command or truly be disposed of. If the player kills him, he simply transfers to another metal body elsewhere. Yes Man was des…",

I'm not a huge fan art guy, but Deimos' work speaks to me—it reimagines this classic game through the lens of fine art, a style that emulates romantic painting, but applied to the side stories and characters of a 2010 RPG. 2281 Overture feels like a particularly illustrative example, showing an NCR-aligned version of the game's final battle with every companion ringed around the Courier (something you can't pull off in an unmodded game).

The full answer is complicated, and Cain took to his YouTube channel Friday to clear the air. Granted, Cain has been prolific since the '90s. While the development studio he co-founded, Troika, stopped making games after Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines, Cain went on to work on games like now-defunct MMO Wildstar and multiple Obsidian RPGs, including The Outer Worlds which he co-directed. However, Cain said in his videos that fans are ever eager to know when he might helm a new RPG in his classic style. \"I love making games, so it really confuses people when they're like, 'Why are you not making games, new IPs?'\" he said in the video. \"Other people have made way more money off of IPs I've created than I've ever made.

Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 people on July 2, 2025, many of them from its Xbox division—a massacre made even more grotesque by the words of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who said as the axe fell that the company's gaming business had \"never looked stronger,\" The cuts also included multiple cancellations including the Perfect Dark reboot (and the closure of the studio making it), Rare's Everwild project, and an unannounced MMO in development at ZeniMax, codenamed Blackbird.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Have you been paying attention this year? A lot can happen in 12 months in PC gaming, and frankly if you can still remember what was going on in January by the time we hit June, you're doing well. By December I'm lucky if I still know my own name. So I always appreciate a refresher on some of the more notable moments, and I thought for 2025, why not make something interactive, to better reactivate all those dormant neurons? This quiz will test you on your knowledge of PC gaming events all across the year, from major releases to unfortunate delays to awards season. By the end, you'll find out: are you a 2025 expert, or are you better off leaving this year in the dust? Let us know your score in the comments below—and your favourite gaming moment of 2025!",

I don't think 2025 is going to go down as a vintage year for the tech of our favourite hobby, but that doesn't mean we've been without either fantastic new toys to play with or new spins on gaming technology to throw at our games. Inevitably the biggest thing to happen to PCs in 2025 was two whole new generations of graphics cards launching from AMD and Nvidia respectively. Both had a lot to offer and both had a heap of problems—though interestingly they were largely more to do with marketing and product positioning than actual hardware issues…",

In a year of increasingly experimental cozy games, they were one of the most identifiable and quintessentially cozy trends. Subgenre trends happen all over gaming (the battle royale to extraction shooter pipeline, for instance) and cozy games are no exception. For a few years after Stardew Valley, absolutely everyone was making a farm sim. Then there was the influx of Townscaper-chasing cozy building games . This year it was the desktop idlers. (Image credit: Mister Morris Games, CaveLiquid, Moczan) They've got their roots back in the early 2000s when desktop pets were novelty applications that ran from your system tray in the bottom right. Back then, they were pretty minimal little apps that ran some simple animations and you could maybe have a couple interactions with. Desktop pets have completely evolved for their 2025 rebirth. No longer just glorified .gifs, they've become entire idler games ticking away in a fraction of your monitor just waiting for you to take a little break from work to poke at …",

In any other world, he'd probably be a villain—after all, he's making children (some ghouls, some not) work 22-hour shifts at the Sunset Sarsaparilla bottling plant, where they're de-bottling the stock to collect all those precious caps. But Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) is so good-natured that I just can't see him as evil. \"Keep it up and you'll have big gross calloused hands in no time!\" he reassures a little ghoul struggling to remove a bottlecap bare-handed. The rallying cry for his army of children: \"Most kids are dead by this age!\" Thaddeus sure puts a positive spin on things. Not so positive: Lucy has been captured by Caesar's Legion while saving one of its members (who they immediately decapitate, because that's how the Legion do), but on the plus side she gets to meet Macaulay Culkin. (Did you know his legal name is Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin? I'll let you Google why.) OK, she doesn't really meet Macaulay Culkin, she meets Legate Lacerta, played by Macaulay Culkin, and she has the same reaction we all did when we met the Legion in Fallout: New Vega…",

It seems like players are eager to embrace the new order, as two decidedly chill games dominated the sales charts around Christmas: Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6. That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat. There's not so much as a competitive ranked mode of play in BF6, and…",

Super-modern processors that are a substantial leap forward in terms of performance, capabilities, and affordability. We won't get that, of course, because we didn't get that this year. Or last year. But there is something GPU-related that can be a lot better, and that's frame generation. Ever since GPU upscaling and frame generation first appeared (DLSS 1.0 in 2019, DLSS 3.0 in 2022), I've always held the opinion that if you couldn't tell they were working, other than just from the performance lift, everyone would be happily using them by default. With the first iteration of both technologies and their corresponding alternatives from AMD and Intel, you could very much tell they were being used, and that's only served to tarnish their reputations. However, when it comes to upscaling these days, it's about as close to perfection as you can get. Assuming it's been properly implemented into a game, of course. When it's all working as intended, Quality or Balanced upscaling at most resolutions does an incredible job, and I always enable it in every game that supports the most recent versions. Alas, I c…",

Tech has hit a hard graphics plateau: raw generational updates are now nuanced upgrades measured in single-digit frame gains rather than evolutions anyone with eyes can appreciate, and the subsequent pivot to AI-generated frames and experimental hair follicles aren't really revving anyone's engines when those upgrades cost a month's rent. Even if the latest hardware really was all that, the precarious AI bubble is locking normal humans out of it anyway. It's good timing, then, that cutting edge graphics are increasingly irrelevant to keeping up with the hobby. A bright spot of 2025 was the continued rise of \"friendslop,\" a cringey internet-spawned label for a broad genre of cooperative games designed for groups of friends. Peak and REPO were the big hits this calendar year, but they're of a kind with Phasmophobia and Lethal Company—all were among the best-selling Steam games of their release years, and it's no coincidence that they'll all run on a budget PC from nine years ago.

When players finally departed Oninoshima, Chapter 6's map, it was a sloppy soup of disconnected ideas, with First Order bases straddling bug-fighting military outposts and buildings from feudal Japan. I struggled to cajole my usual teammates to install updates over this period, let alone dedicate an evening to the game. I wasn't alone—the peak player count regularly dipped below 1.5m over this period, which would've seemed unthinkable a year ago. Yet 2025 also had some of my favorite Fortnite moments in years. The dopaminergic Blitz Royale arrived in June, and I played nothing else for weeks. The Fortnite Simpsons, complete with a standalone shrunken map, was surely one of the game's greatest-ever seasons.
