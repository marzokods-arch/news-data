    "body": "Our build process Every month we build a gaming PC with the latest components and cases—it's good to get stuck in and build something regularly in our opinion. If you're looking for inspiration for your next build, or you're new to the hobby, you can check out our picks below. You can easily make changes to these too, and in some cases, we hope you do. We're building and testing every PC we highlight, and if we run into any issues, we'll explain them here. We're back with another build. This time, a compact white gaming PC, powered by AMD's top gaming CPU, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D , and a Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC Ice SFF . I've tried to gain a few style points with the Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex and Cooler Master Sickleflow Edge 360 fans—three fans combined into a single unit. That's more of a time-saver than you'd think and makes for fewer cables. All of which has been stuffed inside a surprising affordable chassis: Thermaltake's S100 Tempered Glass Snow Edition. This budget case looks better than it should, considering its price tag, and altogether brings this white PC build together nicely.

That's because of the ever-present spectre of AI hanging over our gaming hardware hopes and dreams. After all, AI hardware is where Nvidia makes the vast majority of its money these days, and given the recent loosening of chip export restrictions, I'd say it's a safer bet that most of this memory is destined for China-friendly RTX Pro 6000 variants and the like. Boo. Still, ETnews reports that Nvidia has told Samsung to double up its GDDR7 production—according to its industry sources—and that the Korean DRAM manufacturer has duly responded. The sources are quoted as saying \"mass production is imminent\", although the outlet itself speculates that the GDDR7 is likely destined for AI accelerators. Still, why not both?

Delving into the labyrinthine interiors, we're shown towering, yellow-lit rooms of phenomenal scale, along with the arrival of advanced lithography equipment , vital for the production of TSMC's newest processes.

Dubbed the Acer Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, the mini machines sports a Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip and is aimed at both smaller institutions and individuals looking to tackle AI workloads. Acer's own listing of the Veriton GN100 details the specs further.

These have been recently applied to the industry by big players like Intel in the hopes of stepping ahead of the game, but they might have been beaten to the punch when it comes to commercial application of these machines. A High NA EUV lithography system has just been set up for mass production by SK hynix in its M16 fab based in Icheon, South Korea. SK hynix is a company known for making storage and memory chips. Its using a TWINSCAN EXE:5200B lithography system, as opposed to the 5000 that Intel setup last year, in an effort to produce what will likely be some of the most powerful DRAM ever made. This new system boasts the ability to print transistors 1.7 times smaller than previous High NA EUV machines. It also delivers 2.9 times the existing transistor densities, providing what SK hynix says is a 40% improvement in the NA …",

This Wednesday the game will get its first major update: The Lost Arsenal , a free, 15-card set of new equipment and rooms. Shiny Shoe shared with PC Gamer exclusively four of the cards appearing in the update, and provided commentary on each of them.
