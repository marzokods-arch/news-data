Sadly, we're going to have to wait a bit longer for anything specific, but the official trailer for Season 2 just dropped, and I think it'll tide me over until the episodes finally come out. There is a hell of a lot to unpack in the short two-minute 38-second trailer, but I'm going to try my best to do so. (Image credit: Prime Video) At the end of Fallout Season 1 , our main cast of characters had split up, and it seems like the second season will follow a similar structure to the first in that episodes will cut between the various groups, following their stories side by side. It looks like Maximus and Thaddeus are still together, although Thaddeus has seen better days, as his recent ghoulification has had a couple of visual repercussions. The mouth on his collarbone does not look good. And Maximus still seems obsessed with \"that girl\", our protagonist Lucy MacLean. Cut to Lucy, and she's still got The Ghoul and Dogmeat by her side as she…",

In May of this year, AMD announced a massive new update to its upscaling tech, giving us our first glimpse of FSR 4 \"Redstone\" which was said to be bringing a whole host of machine learning-based improvements. One of the key features is the addition of Ray Regeneration, which, much like Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction tech , is said to be capable of regenerating inaccurate pixels to prevent the gritty, noisy mess that can surround some ray traced lighting effects. The Redstone update was supposed to be making an appearance at some point this year, but it's been so long since we'd heard anything about it, I'd nearly forgotten it existed. Available on AMD Radeon™ RX 9000 Series graphics cards, FSR ‘Redstone’ Ray Regeneration goes live tomorrow in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

But amid all that, we've got a set of patch notes which also look pretty stacked. The 1.20 update doesn't just add Stella Montis into the mix, but it also adds two new arcs, the Matriarch and Shredder, alongside making crafting cheaper, buffing some little arcs, and fixing one of the most annoying issues with PvP fights. (Image credit: Embark) Except for the Wolfpack grenade, which now needs an extra refined explosive, other items like Arc motion cores, circuitry, and launcher ammo are now all cheaper to make, with Spotter Relays and Wolfpacks also being worth more coins now. If you're a fan of the Hullcracker like I am, then this will be music to your ears, as cheaper launcher ammo means more arc explosions. The update also fixed an issue with the Fireball arcs, where they could get stuck on security gates, stopping them from chasing after raiders. Now they'll be able to zoom past the doors right up to your feet and light you up in flames. But the gold medal in this patch notes has to go to the following fix: \"Re…",

The game is also included in Ubisoft's Game Pass-esque subscription on the platform, but it's an odd value proposition when the studio's games so frequently end up on such steep discounts. The promotion is angled to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Ubisoft Connect, as shared in a blog post Monday. I mostly know the app as the cobweb-covered desktop icon I occasionally use to launch Steep or a Rayman game, or as the benign growth I find tacked onto any Ubisoft-published games I try to launch from Steam (a platform Ubisoft has unsuccessfully tried to jump ship from before), but I suppose I can't complain about the cross-play and cross-save.

It didn't work out so well back then, but this time , I think Valve has a real shot at finally decoupling a respectable chunk of PC gaming from Windows, if not the entire saucer section. Tyler Wilde, US EIC (Image credit: Future) This week: I'm considering whether I'd like a cube under my TV while hopping on a flight to help with the next PC Gaming Show, which airs December 4 . In 2017, I wrote a big report about why Steam Machines failed to take off, and the main thing Valve's hardware partners told me was that SteamOS just wasn't ready for the big leagues. The custom Linux distribution didn't support enough hardware or games, and only super-nerds had much enthusiasm for ditching Windows, especially as Windows 8 was being replaced by the much better-liked Windows 10. As a result, the original Steam Machines were never taken seriously as an alternative to desktop PCs or consoles like the Xbox One. Manufacturers started putting Windows on them to get them out the door. \"Nobody …",

Are you wearing the Ryder skin in its black and orange styling? Well, you might be shot on sight. \"Pro tip. Every time you see someone wearing this specific outfit, do not ask questions, do not bother [talking to] them, do not ask them if they need help,\" YouTuber Onepeg said in an X post over a streamer using the Ryder skin. \"Just f***ing murder them.\" The exact skin in question is Ryder, one of the outfits given away on the first Arc Raiders battle pass. More specifically, it's the orange and black version of the Ryder skin with its helmet goggled off and its headgear toggled on. The supposedly untrustworthy subject might also have goggles. It looks like this: (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I was inclined to chalk this up to streamers saying things out loud without worrying about their accuracy, but interestingly, this specific instance of fashion profiling seems to be corroborated by other players and streamers.

It sounds like a medical issue but I assure you, it's all about ensuring the Steam Frame's wireless connection is strong, stable, and appears high quality. The Steam Frame offers a few ways to play games, both locally on its own Arm chip and streamed from a nearby gaming PC. As the name suggests, foveated streaming is used during the latter. \"So, a lot of people might have heard of foveated rendering,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve working on the Steam Frame, says. \"That's where you use the direction you're looking at to optimise what the device is doing. So it only has to do a lot of work in that area. We are doing something similar to that dedicated to the streaming process.\" Foveated streaming requires the Steam Frame's new eye tracking feature. This uses two cameras embedded just above the wearer's eyes, through which Valve can very quickly monitor where a user is looking at any one time. The clearest patch of your vision, that's thanks to your fovea, hence the name. Connecting to a PC via its own wireless adapter and a dedicated 6 GHz connection, the Steam Frame h…",

You play Eugene Harrow, a man fresh off a mental breakdown who's been carted off to a motel in the middle of nowhere for some probably necessary but not very voluntary therapy and ends up stuck in a 47 minute time loop. This has the effect on his mental health that you might expect. As he explores the time he's allotted, he discovers the secrets of the loop, learns about the community he's found himself …",

But its return to modern-military gunplay with a big lick of destruction won over even the most cynical of multiplayer FPS heads. But then its battle royale mode Redsec came out, and the live-service gears shrieked into motion with a disappointing new map and weekly challenges that mandated battle royale play, putting a decisive end to Battlefield 6's honeymoon period. With BF Studios rushing to quell these issues as Steam reviews drop to Mixed, Battlefield 6's developers have also addressed the situation. Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.\" Wiebe also discussed BF Studios' approach to responding to issues brought…",
