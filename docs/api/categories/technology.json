I’ve been using AI Notification Summaries on my Pixel 10 for over two months now, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised every time I’ve seen them.",

Regulators want specific, detailed accounts of failed calls, text issues, 911 access, and business impact from the public. You can submit your report until March 16, 2026. If you saw an SOS icon instead of your usual 5G bars last Wednesday, you probably felt cut off from the digital world. Verizon has since fixed the problem and restored service , but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now starting its own probe. Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours. Many customers saw only the SOS icon instead of signal bars, which meant they could still call emergency services, but regular calls and data did not work.",

This could be due to the company’s interpretation of EU regulations regarding software updates. It seems like the regulations don’t actually force smartphone makers to offer software updates at all. The European Commission introduced a variety of regulations for electronics that went into effect last year. One of these rules forces manufacturers to up their game when it comes to software updates. Unfortunately, it sounds like the EU’s own wording has enabled brands like Motorola to actually offer phones with disappointing update policies .

For a long time, my stubbornness worked — I just waited patiently for top TikTok videos to hit Instagram and then laughed just like everyone else. But when a group stepped in to take over TikTok in the US from ByteDance and implemented strict new terms of service, it grabbed my attention. It amped up tracking, pared back privacy, and caused users to flee in droves — many turning to a new platform I’d never heard of called UpScrolled .",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Global smartphone chipset shipments are expected to fall 7% in 2026, but industry revenue is still set to grow in double digits. AI-driven data center demand is pushing chipmakers toward high-margin HBM, driving up DRAM prices and squeezing phone makers. Budget phones under $150 are taking the biggest hit as rising costs make low-end devices harder to sustain. The smartphone industry is facing a paradox. Counterpoint Research reports that global smartphone chipset shipments will drop by 7% in 2026. Normally, fewer shipments would mean trouble for the industry , but this time, manufacturers are still expected to see double-digit revenue growth. So, why are shipments dropping? Part of the reason is the growing demand from data centers . As AI becomes more common, chipmakers are shifting their resources to produce high-margin HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for large server farms. This shift has caused DRAM prices to rise sharply, making it harder for manufacturers to create affordable phones without taking a loss.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",
