    "body": "Alongside first-person shooters and real-time strategy games, the '90s was also the golden era of space combat simulators. From Star Wars: X-Wing to Freespace 2 , whipping out your joystick to blow up spaceships in nausea-inducing 3D spaceflight was a formative experience for every first-generation PC gamer. Among those space sims jostling for supremacy was Star Quest 1 in the 27 th Century . Developed by Virtual Adventures Inc and released in November 1995, its defining feature was how it allowed seamless transition between open space and planetary atmospheres, which technically put it decades ahead of games like No Man's Sky. Sadly, this wasn't enough to make Star Quest a big success, and the game's been largely forgotten in the interceding years. Until now, that is. Three decades since Star Quest first appeared, its designer Paul Lauzon has updated the space combat sim so that it works on modern machines, and re-released it over on itch. Best of all, you can download it for completely free. Lauzon announced the game's rerelease over on Reddit . \"I’m the original developer of Star Quest 1 in the 27th Century, first released in 1995,\" he wrote in the post. \"I spent the last few w…",

    "body": "If you read the history books of the 16th century, Sayyida al-Hurra will rarely show up. The powerful women of the Mediterranean and Islam typically don't, except as footnotes or asides. So her leadership, piracy and plundering for her people never quite made the major texts. But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious. Sayyida was one of two women in El Haimeur's memory to hold the title, and the only one in Morocco. \"It became a research question for m…",
