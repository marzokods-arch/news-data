On Baltoro Glacier, red areas, indicating high ice velocities, propagate slowly downslope throughout the melting season. NASA/Chad Greene For the first time, scientists have created a comprehensive global dataset revealing how the world’s glaciers speed up and slow down with the seasons. Published in Science in November 2025, this groundbreaking study analyzed over 36 million satellite image pairs—including decades of Landsat data—to track the seasonal “pulse” of every major glacier on Earth. The research, built off the ITS_LIVE ice velocity dataset from NASA’s Jet Propuls…",

The agency concluded a wet dress rehearsal for the agency’s Artemis II test flight early Tuesday morning, successfully loading cryogenic propellant into the SLS (Space Launch System) tanks, sending a team out to the launch pad to closeout Orion, and safely draining the rocket. The wet dress rehearsal was a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket, designed to identify any issues and resolve them before attempting a launch. To allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal, NASA now will target&nbsp; March &nbsp;as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.

Though natural breaks in sea ice are called leads , the better term for the human-made fracture seen in these satellite images is a ship channel. In the austral summer, usually in January, an icebreaker rams a path through the fast ice —a type of sea ice that is anchored to the shore—that often covers McMurdo Sound.

Following a fueling test of NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket at the launch pad for the Artemis II Moon mission, leaders will discuss initial results during a news conference at 1 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 3. The agency’s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft arrived at Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Jan. 17. Since then, engineers have been conducting a variety of tests prior to launch. Underway now is a wet dress rehearsal , which requires filling the rocket with the 700,000 gallons of propellant.
