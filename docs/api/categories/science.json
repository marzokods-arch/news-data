    "body": "NASA/Don Pettit NASA astronaut Don Pettit demonstrates electrostatic forces using charged water droplets and a knitting needle made of Teflon. This series of overlapping frames from Feb. 19, 2025, displays the unique attraction-repulsion properties of Teflon and charged droplets, similar to how charged particles from the Sun behave when they come in contact with Earth’s magnetic field. Highly energetic particles from space that collide with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere create the&nbsp; aurora borealis .

Similar polygonal patterns in various strata were seen previously, elsewhere in Gale Crater. Curiosity captured the image using its Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), located on the turret at the end of the rover’s robotic arm, on Dec. 11, 2025 — Sol 4745, or Martian day 4,745 of the Mars Science Laboratory mission — at 16:55:37 UTC.
