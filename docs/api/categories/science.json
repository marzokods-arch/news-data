    "body": "Back in May Auroch Digital found a delightful way to announce the existence of Boltgun 2, teasing it at the end of a free typing game . And while it's nice to know Boltgun 2 is in development, it's nicer to know a bit about what it will actually contain. The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too? I just hope I don't get lost in the levels as often as I did in the original. Boltgun 2 will be out in 2026, and available on Steam . I'm sure the internet will be completely normal abou…",
