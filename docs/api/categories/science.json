Since Alan Shepard became the first American to lay eyes on our home planet from above, countless NASA astronauts have described feeling awed by the astonishing sight and a profound shift in perspective that followed. NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick points his camera through a cupola window as the International Space Station orbits 262 miles above the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa.
