    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Researchers intercepted T-Mobile call and text data using an $800 off-the-shelf satellite setup. Around half of the satellite links they scanned were unencrypted, including military data. T-Mobile fixed the issue after being alerted in December 2024, and told us that only a limited number of cell sites in remote, low-population areas were affected. Update: October 14, 2025 (2:00 PM ET): Following publication of the original article below, T-Mobile contacted us to provide the following statement: “T-Mobile immediately addressed a vendor’s technical misconfiguration that affected a limited number of cell sites using geosynchronous satellite backhaul in remote, low-population areas, as identified in this research from 2024. This was not network-wide, is unrelated to our T-Satellite direct-to-cell offering, and we implemented nationwide Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content. We appreciate our collaboration with the security research community, whose work …",

    "body": "Widgets have been a part of the Android experience for a long time, and I use them every day. From controlling my earbuds and smart home devices to showing my agenda or to-do list, they’re an essential part of any mobile OS I use. One of my favorite widget features is widget stacks, something Samsung added to its phones in One UI 5 back in 2022. Google phones lack the feature, and it’s been a sticking point since I switched to a Pixel 10 Pro . Thankfully, I’ve found an alternative. What are widget stacks? Before I talk about the new app that I’ve found, I should clarify what widget stacks are. On a Samsung phone, you can long-press a widget that’s already on your home screen and tap a Create stack button. This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there. Once you’ve selected the second widget, One UI stacks it on top of the one that was already on your home screen. Now, you can scroll horizontally through those widgets.",
