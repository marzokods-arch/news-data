Frattare Celebrate the New Year with the “Champagne Cluster,” a galaxy cluster seen in this new image from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical telescopes. Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

This newsletter evolved in parallel with NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS). It is almost impossible to speak of this newsletter without mentioning EOS. As The Earth Observer prepares its final publication, NASA also plans to shutter its three EOS flagship satellites (discussed below) possibly as early as the end of 2026. While EOS was “much more than its satellites,” one cannot deny that the satellite missions and their iconic images provide an entry point to the overarching work conducted by the EOS science teams for almost three decades. These efforts spanned crucial complementary ground- and aircraft-based observations along with focused field campaigns to coordinate observations across multiple levels of Earth system time and spatia…",

No new content will be published after Dec. 31, 2025. While the sunset of The Earth Observer is bittersweet for our team, the good news is that all of the rich historical and descriptive content preserved on The Earth Observer ‘s archives page will remain accessible to the world. If you’ve never checked this page out, I highly encourage you to do so. You’ll find all of our archived issues saved in a PDF format, and – if you scroll down the page – you’ll find an annotated bibliography with links to numerous entries about a variety of topics to provide the historic context of the progress and accomplishments of the Earth Observing System (EOS). – Alan Ward , Executive Editor, The Earth Observer Almost 37 years ago, in March 1989, the first issue of Th…",
