    "body": "Warhammer 40,000 is big. Really big. You may think Hitman 2 takes up a lot of space on your hard drive, but that's just peanuts compared to Warhammer 40,000. This is a setting where multiple entire chapters of space marines can be lost, whether they're deliberately expunged from all records like the second and eleventh legions were, or just go missing like the Crimson Axes . The Steel Confessors are an interesting example, because they didn't vanish in the lore, but out here in the real world of primary sources. While references to them in White Dwarf magazine and the Index Astartes exist, the main source of detail about the Steel Confessors was a flimsy pamphlet handed out at the official Games Day & Golden Demon convention in 2005. Since nobody could source a copy of it, all the detail contained within was basically a big \"citation needed\" and has been a point of contention in the 40K fandom for 20 years. Until a Discord user called Guy posted blurry photos of the official programme from Games Day & Golden Demon 2005 , confirming the Steel Confessors were a legit chapter, that their homeworld really was named after the Finnish national epic Kalevala, and that planet had its own …",

    "body": "North Korea has long been accused of being a major state sponsor of cybercrime. The isolated authoritarian regime uses hacking groups, including the infamous Lazarus Group, to target both large crypto companies and wealthy individuals, with the proceeds being used to prop up a country that, by any metric, is an economic basket case: the United Nations estimates such activity now accounts for 13% of North Korea's GDP. An increased focus on targeting individuals with large crypto wealth has seen North Korean hackers make off with more than $2 billion so far this year alone, according to investigators at Elliptic , a research firm dedicated to identifying and stopping cybercrime ( thanks, BBC ). Elliptic says such individuals are \"increasingly attractive targets\" because they often lack \"the security measures employed by businesses.\" Some individuals are targeted due to an association with businesses holding large amounts of cryptoassets. This in turn has led to more hacks achieved through social engineering, rather than security flaws, which introduces further problems in estimating just how much of this activity is going on: individuals are less likely to report what's happened to …",
