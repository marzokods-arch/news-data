    "body": "When it comes to PC monitors, I've been a high-DPI aficionado—OK, a high-DPI bore—since forever. So, forgive me for feeling just a touch of triumphant as I report on new research that entirely vindicates my personal peccadilloes when it comes to pixel density . It turns out really high-res PC monitors are worth it, after all. Huzzah! Now, when it comes to pixel density, viewing distance and screen size are critical. Handily, researchers from Cambridge University and Meta Reality Labs (via Tomshardware ) have come up with a display resolution calculator that factors all that in, plus new data on the actual acuity of the human eye, and shows whether you're wasting your time on that fancy new monitor or TV. To work all this out, the researchers took a closer look at what the human eye is actually capable of. They found humans can discern more pixels than previously thought, but there are still limits. \"Our results demonstrate that the resolution limit is higher than what was previously believed, reaching 94 pixels per degree (ppd) for foveal achromatic vision, 89 ppd for red-green patterns, and 53 ppd for yellow-violet patterns,\" the paper published in Nature says . Pixels per degree…",

    "body": "Mushrooms are the coolest. Not quite flora, not quite fauna, they are a secret third thing—isn't that neat? Many types of fungi have also been observed to form symbiotic relationships with the root systems of plants. Sometimes mutualistic, sometimes parasitic, this root-meets-fungus network is called 'Mycorrhiza'—and a similar web of mycelium may one day come to a rig near you. No, this isn't my pitch for a funguspunk trilogy, this is actual science. Researchers at the Ohio State University recently found that mushrooms you can eat can also be trained to act as bioelectronic data processors (via phys.org ). Specifically, the team grew shiitake and button mushrooms, dehydrated these cultures for long-term use, and trained the fungi to function like organic memristors through methodical electrocution. I know that sounds wild , but that's not even the raddest part. The researchers observed the dehydrated fungus demonstrated an ability to remember past electrical states, with the mushrooms able to reproduce memory effects in a way not dissimilar to traditional semiconductor chips. The research project was partly inspired by how human brains produce neural activity through electrical i…",
