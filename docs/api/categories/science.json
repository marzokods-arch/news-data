    "body": "NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured this sparkling scene of star birth in an image released on Sept. 4, 2025. Called Pismis 24, this young star cluster resides in the core of the nearby Lobster Nebula, approximately 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve. Captured in infrared light by Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. The largest and most brilliant ones with the six-point diffraction spikes are the most massive stars in the cluster. Hundreds to thousands of smaller members of the cluster appear as white, yellow, and red, depending on their stellar type and the amount of dust enshrouding them. Webb also shows us tens of thousands of stars behind the cluster that are part of the Milky Way galaxy. Learn more about this star cluster. Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new space in the Gemini app to store all media generated with it. The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library. And we now know how it could work. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Funded primarily by the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program, this 10-year campaign has included field, airborne, and satellite remote sensing research to address its overarching scientific question of how environmental change in the Arctic and boreal region of western North America will affect vulnerable ecosystems and society. ABoVE deployed in three phases: 1) ecosystem dynamics (2015–2018); 2) ecosystem services (2017–2022); and 3) analysis and synthesis (2023–present).
