NASA In 2025, NASA and its international partners celebrate 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station. Since November 2, 2000, more than 290 people from 26 countries have lived and worked aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting thousands of experiments that have advanced science and technology on Earth and paved the way for Artemis missions to the Moon and future journeys to Mars.&nbsp; Beyond its role as a science platform, the station has been a bridge—connecting cultures, sparking creativity, and inspiring generations. The memories of Johnson Space Center employees reflect how the orbiting laboratory is not only an engineering marvel but also a deeply human endeavor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christopher Brown – Advancing Life Support Systems for Future Exploration &nbsp; Christopher Brown (center) receives the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement alongside NASA astronaut Sunita Williams.
