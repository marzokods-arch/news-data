    "body": "2 min read NASA Citizen Science Toolkit for Librarians Librarians: NASA Citizen Science has something for you! Our new Toolkit for Librarians can help you share NASA citizen science opportunities with your patrons and community members. Rural and urban libraries, informal educators, youth group leaders, and retirement community coordinators can all benefit from this resource. Together, we can open the door for more people to join the fun, learning, and thrill of doing NASA science. The toolkit prepares a program leader to lead a NASA Science event for people ages 8 and up. The toolkit includes: A guide to help you prepare for the event, from choosing and equipping the space, to becoming familiar with the citizen science project that will be the focus of the event An editable 8.5” by 11” poster to advertise your event A model agenda to follow during your event A handout for you and your participants to help you explore NASA-sponsored citizen science project opportunities The toolkit creators, Sarah Kirn (Participatory Science Strategist, NASA, from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute) and Kara Reiman (librarian), together with NASA’s Citizen Science Officer Marc Kuchner, also reco…",

At left, the Po Valley urban corridor in Italy shines with the metropolitan areas of Milan and Turin and their surrounding suburbs. Crew members aboard the orbital lab have produced hundreds of thousands of images of the land, oceans, and atmosphere of Earth, and even of the Moon through Crew Earth Observations . Their photographs of Earth record how the planet changes over time due to human activity and natural events. This allows scientists to monitor disasters and direct response on the ground and study a number of phenomena, from the movement of glaciers to urban wildlife. Image credit: JAXA/Kimiya Yui",

    "body": "To see Earth from space is to be forever changed by the view. Since Alan Shepard became the first American to lay eyes on our home planet from above, countless NASA astronauts have described feeling awed by the astonishing sight and a profound shift in perspective that followed. NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick points his camera through a cupola window as the International Space Station orbits 262 miles above the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa. NASA This unique experience is known as the overview effect – a term coined in 1987 by space philosopher and author Frank White in a book of the same name. The phenomenon creates powerful changes in the way astronauts think about Earth and life and can be particularly strong for those who lived and worked aboard the International Space Station during its 25 years of continuous human presence. The orbiting laboratory’s cupola module, equipped with seven windows looking down on Earth, provides the perfect place for observation and reflection. NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins is pictured looking out from the International Space Station&#8217;s &#8220;window to the world&#8221; – the cupola. Astronauts use the seven-windowed observation mo…",
