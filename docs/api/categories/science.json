    "body": "Do you ever feel a bit funny and then realize you've not left your apartment in five days? No, just me then? Broken Lore: Don't Lie, a spin-off of the horror game Don't Watch, encapsulates that feeling and then some. It puts you in the shoes of Junko, an isolated young woman losing her grip on reality while in self-imposed isolation. Don't Lie was shown off for the first time during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and the trailer gave me chills. Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations. The trailer shows off the mix of hyper realistic interiors like swimming pools and hallways covered in notes, as well as a scary, eye-covered monster inspired by the Dodomeki, a Japanese folklore spirit. There are so, so many eyes. To contrast the scares is a fully-playable versi…",

    "body": "Stario: Haven Tower isn't the first vertical city-builder I've seen, or even the first one I've seen this year . But it is the first I've encountered that also features floating space whales, which immediately makes it the one I'm most interested in playing. Does this demonstrate how badly the Internet has affected my attention span? Well, I'll have you know that—ooh, a squirrel! Developed by Chinese outfit Stargate Games, Stario: Haven Tower tasks you with constructing a literal towering civilization. Through \"six atmospheric layers\", your metropolitan column will rise from a sandy, lifeless wilderness all the way up to a painterly cosmos. While the verticality is what initially intrigued me about Stario (that and the space whales), what really makes it interesting is how it folds logistics into city-planning. Each layer of the tower must store its own supplies, so you'll need to figure out how to move goods between them. At the outset, this may involved good old fashioned elbow grease, ordering your \"Towertizens\" (a portmanteau unlikely to catch on, I fear). As you research new tech, however, you'll be able to produce hot air balloons, pipelines, and a technology called \"Strongh…",
