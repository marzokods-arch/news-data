    "body": "The Sierra Space Dream Chaser winged spacecraft is seen stacked atop its Shooting Star cargo module on the vibration table at NASA’s Armstrong Test Facility in Sandusky, Ohio, while undergoing testing to simulate launch and re-entry conditions. NASA In 2016, NASA awarded a Commercial Resupply Services-2 contract to Sierra Space,&nbsp;formerly part of&nbsp;Sierra Nevada Corporation, to resupply the International Space Station with its Dream Chaser spaceplane and companion Shooting Star cargo module. As part of its contract, Sierra Space was awarded&nbsp;a minimum seven flights, and the agency previously issued firm-fixed price task orders for four Dream Chaser resupply missions based on the needs of the space station. After a thorough evaluation, NASA and Sierra Space have mutually agreed to modify the contract as the company determined Dream Chaser development is best served by a free flight demonstration, targeted in late 2026. Sierra Space will continue providing insight to NASA into the development of Dream Chaser, including through the flight demonstration. NASA will provide minimal support through the remainder of the development and the flight demonstration. As part of the m…",

NASA will continue to build upon the incredible scientific advancements of the past and present as we pursue our goal to maintain our nation’s space dominance through Gold Standard Science.” Images from the spacecraft, which was launched by ISRO on July 30, display the level of detail with which NISAR scans Earth to provide unique, actionable i…",
