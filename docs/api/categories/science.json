    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new space in the Gemini app to store all media generated with it. The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library. And we now know how it could work. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The research was produced on behalf of DIMA by music consumer research/analyst service Music Watch Inc., based on American music listener surveys conducted in 2023 and 2024. It found that the average Americana fan spends twice as much as the average American music streamer on music — recorded music, live and merchandise — each year ($837 versus $400), characterizing the degree of their activity as &#8220;superfan-level.&#8221; Related Sierra Ferrell, Billy Strings &amp; More Nominated for 2025 Americana Honors &amp; Awards: Full&nbsp;List Tileyard Education and BMG Production Library Release Four New EPs Showcasing Emerging Songwriters Miranda Lambert Set to Headline Colorado&#039;s Ford Amphitheater on Sept. 28 The research also found that Americana music listeners spend 24% more time listening to music in an average week than other music fans, with Americana listeners spending 28.3 hours per week versus 22.8 hours for the average music fan.

Funded primarily by the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program, this 10-year campaign has included field, airborne, and satellite remote sensing research to address its overarching scientific question of how environmental change in the Arctic and boreal region of western North America will affect vulnerable ecosystems and society. ABoVE deployed in three phases: 1) ecosystem dynamics (2015–2018); 2) ecosystem services (2017–2022); and 3) analysis and synthesis (2023–present). Now in the last year of the third phase, the Science Team (ST) consists of 67 active NASA-funded projects with more than 1000 individuals participating. The ABoVE ST has me…",
