NASA A NASA internship provides a stellar opportunity to launch your future as part of America’s aerospace workforce. NASA interns take on meaningful work and contribute to exciting agency projects with the guidance of a supportive mentor. The agency&#8217;s internship program regularly ranks as the nation’s most prestigious and competition is steep: in fiscal year 2025, NASA&#8217;s Office of STEM Engagement received about 250,000 internship applications for its roughly 1,800 internship opportunities. To give you the best shot at a NASA internship, we’ve compiled a list of tips mentors say can make an application stand out from the crowd. It is NASA’s mentors who create internship project descriptions, review applications, and take the lead in choosing candidates to work on their specific internship projects. Here’s what they had to say: 1. Your personal statement is your chance to make a lasting impression. Mentors pay close attention to personal statements to identify the best…",
