    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Play Store is getting updated with a new “You” tab. The tab brings an organized feed of your progress and achievements from different games and apps. With this update, Google is also expanding semantic search using AI. The Google Play Store is, for most people, the default destination to download apps on Android devices. Over the years, it has been refined and undergone several changes to make it easier to discover more apps with fewer steps. And now, Google is seeding another updated version intended to improve app search and keep a tab on your activity and achievements across different apps and games. Google has released a new Play Store update, bumping its version to 48.2. Among the significant changes introduced by the update is a new “You” tab, which replaces the Books tab in the bottom bar. Here, you can find personalized content to help you make better use of the apps and games already installed on your phone. Although we don’t have the update yet, Google shared some information in a recent blog post that provides more details about the new tab.",
