NASA/Brandon Hancock As America approaches its 250th anniversary of declaring independence, NASA’s Artemis II mission will carry a host of mementos that reflect the nation’s long tradition of exploration, innovation, and leadership in its official flight kit. The items will fly aboard the Orion spacecraft, launched on top of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, as it carries four astronauts around the Moon on the first crewed test flight of the agency’s Artemis campaign. “Historical artifacts flying aboard Artemis II reflect the long arc of American exploration and the generations of innovators who made this moment possible,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “This mission will bring together pieces of our earliest achievements in aviation, defining moments from…",

    "summary": "Even without the space it deserves, the AWOL Vision Aetherion Max shines.",
    "body": "Ultra-short-throw (UST) projectors are meant to be a practical alternative to massive TVs. They promise big-screen immersion without permanent installations, and I appreciate not having to climb a ladder to mount anything to my ceiling. The irony is that the best UST projectors still require something many homes don’t have: space. After a week with AWOL Vision’s Aetherion Max, it became clear that I don’t have a room with a wall large enough, or a layout flexible enough, to fully take advantage of what this projector can do. And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Researchers found a way to hide malicious instructions within a normal Google Calendar invite that Gemini can unknowingly execute. When users asked Gemini about their schedule, it could be tricked into summarizing their private meetings and leaking that data into a new event. Google was duly notified and has added new protections, but the issue highlights how AI features can be abused through natural language. Google recently made Gemini a lot more useful by letting it work across multiple Calendars , not just your primary one. You can now ask about events or create new meetings across secondary calendars using natural language. But just as that update rolled out, security researchers shared a worrying new finding about how Gemini can be exploited to access someone’s private and confidential Calendar information.",
