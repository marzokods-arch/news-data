On Jan. 7, the agency announced it was postponing a planned spacewalk originally scheduled for Jan. 8 while teams monitored a medical concern with a crew member currently living and working aboard the orbital laboratory. The matter involved a single crew member, who is stable . Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member. Participants in the news conference include: NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman Amit Kshatriya, associate administrator Dr. James Polk, chief health and medical officer, NASA Headquarters NASA will provide live coverage of the news conference on NASA+ , Amazon Prime , and the agency’s YouTube channel .

Lanteris Space Systems Development continues on NASA’s Power and Propulsion Element, a solar electric propulsion spacecraft designed to provide power for Gateway in lunar orbit. Able to generate 60 kilowatts of power, the element was successfully powered on earlier last year. The milestone demonstrates the element can provide the spacecraft with power, high-rate communications, attitude control, as well as the ability to maintain and maneuver between orbits. The Power and Propulsion Element is managed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and built by industry partner Lanteris Space Systems in Palo Alto, California, where teams have secured the element’s main electrical system inside protective exterior panels. On deck for installation at Lanteris Space Systems are three 12-kilowatt advanced electric propulsion system thrusters, manufactured by L3Harris, and four 6-kilowatt Busek-built BHT-6000 thrusters.

    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung has shelved Ballie, killing plans for a consumer launch that was once teased for summer 2025. Ballie has shifted from a planned retail product to an internal “active innovation platform,” meaning it’s now for Samsung’s labs. Samsung’s cute, rolling robot assistant, once promised for homes by summer 2025 , has now been shelved. This shift marks a sudden turn from the optimism Samsung showed when Ballie was first introduced in 2020. The small, round robot was meant to be a mobile smart home assistant that could follow you, control devices, and project images onto walls. Now, Samsung is effectively putting an end to hopes for a commercial launch.",

Kepler’s Supernova Remnant, named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was first spotted in the night sky in 1604. Today, astronomers know that a white dwarf star exploded when it exceeded a critical mass, after pulling material from a companion star, or merging with another white dwarf. This kind of supernova is known as a Type Ia, and scientists use it to measure the expansion of the universe. Supernova remnants, the debris fields left behind after a stellar explosion, of…",
