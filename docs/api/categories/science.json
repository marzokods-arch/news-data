    "body": "During a preview panel at MagicCon: Atlanta, Wizards of the Coast revealed most of the 2026 lineup for Magic: The Gathering. It's looking like a year dominated by returns to existing settings—with two popular planes from Magic's multiverse, and two Universes Beyond crossovers enjoying comebacks—though we'll also be getting a Star Trek set and something called Reality Fractures as well. Beginning with Universes Beyond, while it was already known that the current Spider-Man set would only be the first dip in the Marvel waters for Magic, we didn't know exactly what corner of the Marvel Universe we'd visit next. Now we do. June will bring a set called Marvel Super Heroes that features the Avengers and various Avenger-adjacent characters like the Fantastic Four, Squirrel Girl, the Heroes For Hire, and Wolverine, as well as villains like Killmonger, MODOK, and Loki. The next return is a less-expected one, with The Hobbit double-dipping on Middle-earth after the success of the Lord of the Rings expansion . Expect Smaug and Bilbo and alternate takes on characters who already featured in the Tales of Middle-earth set like Gandalf and Gollum in August. The Star Trek cards coming in November…",

    "body": "Do you ever feel a bit funny and then realize you've not left your apartment in five days? No, just me then? Broken Lore: Don't Lie, a spin-off of the horror game Don't Watch, encapsulates that feeling and then some. It puts you in the shoes of Junko, an isolated young woman losing her grip on reality while in self-imposed isolation. Don't Lie was shown off for the first time during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and the trailer gave me chills. Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations. The trailer shows off the mix of hyper realistic interiors like swimming pools and hallways covered in notes, as well as a scary, eye-covered monster inspired by the Dodomeki, a Japanese folklore spirit. There are so, so many eyes. To contrast the scares is a fully-playable versi…",
