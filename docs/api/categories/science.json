Lanteris Space Systems Development continues on NASA’s Power and Propulsion Element, a solar electric propulsion spacecraft designed to provide power for Gateway in lunar orbit. Able to generate 60 kilowatts of power, the element was successfully powered on earlier last year. The milestone demonstrates the element can provide the spacecraft with power, high-rate communications, attitude control, as well as the ability to maintain and maneuver between orbits. The Power and Propulsion Element is managed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and built by industry partner Lanteris Space Systems in Palo Alto, California, where teams have secured the element’s main electrical system inside protective exterior panels. On deck for installation at Lanteris Space Systems are three 12-kilowatt advanced electric propulsion system thrusters, manufactured by L3Harris, and four 6-kilowatt Busek-built BHT-6000 thrusters.

    "body": "Credit: Samsung TL;DR Samsung has shelved Ballie, killing plans for a consumer launch that was once teased for summer 2025. Ballie has shifted from a planned retail product to an internal “active innovation platform,” meaning it’s now for Samsung’s labs. Samsung’s cute, rolling robot assistant, once promised for homes by summer 2025 , has now been shelved. This shift marks a sudden turn from the optimism Samsung showed when Ballie was first introduced in 2020. The small, round robot was meant to be a mobile smart home assistant that could follow you, control devices, and project images onto walls. Now, Samsung is effectively putting an end to hopes for a commercial launch.",

Crews began demolition in mid-December at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator, a facility built in the late 1960s that once enabled NASA astronauts and researchers to experience near-weightlessness. The facility was also used to conduct underwater testing of space hardware and practice runs for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope. The simulator was closed in 1997.
