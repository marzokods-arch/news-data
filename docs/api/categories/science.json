    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Elon Musk’s SpaceX may build its own phone with satellite internet connectivity. The company is reportedly looking to expand to other products, including mobile devices. The device may differ from traditional smartphones, but details on that are currently limited. Elon Musk’s SpaceX recently acquired xAI , making it the highest-valued private company yet. But the rocket maker does not want to stop there, and is now exploring other markets for products even loosely related to space. After dominating satellite-based internet and direct-to-cell services with its Starlink venture, SpaceX may expand into making its own smartphones, Reuters reported earlier today. The phone could feature built-in hardware to use Starlink’s internet services, offer direct-to-device connectivity, and support SpaceX’s recently launched Stargaze space-tracking service.",
