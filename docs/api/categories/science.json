    "body": "The Sun blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament over a three-hour period on Feb. 24, 2015. Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun, it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth. NASA The NASA-ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft captured this extreme ultraviolet wavelength image of the Sun on Feb. 24, 2015, during a three-hour period in which our closest star blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament. While some of the strands fell back into the Sun, a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles. Launched in December 1995, the joint NASA-ESA SOHO mission, was designed to study the Sun inside out. Though its mission was scheduled to run until only 1998, it has continued collecting data, adding to scientists&#8217; understanding of our closest star, and making many new discoveries , including more than 5,000 comets. NASA continues to study the Sun with various spacecraft. Soon, there will be three new ways to study the Sun’s influence across the solar system with the launch of a trio of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecraft.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new space in the Gemini app to store all media generated with it. The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library. And we now know how it could work. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.
