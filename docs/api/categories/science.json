    "body": "Thanksgiving Weekend is normally a quiet time for new releases — but that doesn&#8217;t mean the worlds of hip-hop and R&amp;B stopped spinning. On Thanksgiving (Nov. 27), R&amp;B singer Ray J was taken into custody by Los Angeles police and charged with making a criminal threat after allegedly pointing a gun at his ex-wife, Princess Love, during a livestreamed argument. The &#8220;One Wish&#8221; singer, who&#8217;s also Brandy&#8217;s younger brother, was released on $50,000 bond later that night. &#8220;The worse it gets, the better it gets for us, impression-wise, algorithm-wise, profit-wise, everything,&#8221; he explained to Cam Newton on an episode of the former NFL star&#8217;s Funky Friday podcast, which resurfaced following the holiday arrest. By the end of the holiday weekend (Nov. 30), the NFL unveiled the official lineup for the Super Bowl LX pregame . Charlie Puth will perform the national anthem, Brandi Carlile will sing &#8220;America the Beautiful,&#8221; and Coco Jones will deliver a rendition of &#8220;Lift Every Voice and Sing.&#8221; All three Grammy-nominated vocalists will take the stage ahead of Bad Bunny&#8217;s highly anticipated 2026 Apple Music Super Bo…",
