    "body": "From the developers that brought us Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Clickolding, and El Paso, Elsewhere, comes the sequel I didn't know I needed: Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator. Yep, it's exactly what it sounds like: a game where you trade and bet on alien babies as though they were stocks. Capitalism is hell. Download the demo Download the Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator demo on Steam The first-ever gameplay trailer for Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator just debuted during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, and what a ride it was. I had a blast with the original, although it taught me I know absolutely nothing about the stock market. The sequel looks like a real improvement—even if the idea of trading babies makes me a tad uneasy. But hey, who am I to question intergalactic culture? The main gameplay loop revolves around the trading day. Pick a baby, find a shadowy broker who can give you more information about what the market will do, and then buy and sell shares as its value shoots wildly up and down. The baby's life is described on screen as you trade. Events such as playing with sticks and getting lost in a maze can raise and decrease the wee babby's value,…",

    "body": "From the publisher of Blue Prince and developer Exnilo Studio comes what looks like another mind-bending puzzle game: Revealed at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted, Rivage sees you stuck in a time loop aboard a seemingly abandoned space station. It's a bad situation, but if Matt Damon can defeat the odds in space, then so can you. Add it to your wishlist Wishlist Rivage on Steam The reveal trailer introduces us to Miranda, a scientist from the 25th century sent to study the newly discovered planet VESTA. The space station A.R.E.S is supposed to be the base from which she'll determine if the stellar body can be colonized by an expanding human civilization, but it's hit with a powerful magnetic field that warps the very fabric of time and space itself. Not the best day for her, but as a scientist, this is just another problem for Miranda to solve. The trailer shows off some of the puzzles you'll be completing, and I hope you've brushed up on your astrophysics, because there's a lot of mathematical formulas on the whiteboards. You'll be hunting for keycards, moving rooms about, rotating interstellar maps, and fiddling with what I can only describe as a sci-fi Rubik's cube. It all looks…",
