    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s latest NotebookLM update adds a new “goals” feature to shape how chat responds. Chat can also now handle far more information at once, thanks to Gemini. Conversations save automatically, making it easier to pick up long-term projects later. We’ve made no secret of the fact that we really like NotebookLM. It’s one of Google’s best AI tools right now, and we’ve used it for everything from sorting apartment contracts to pulling together health explainers and gaming guides. It’s not perfect , but it’s genuinely useful. Google’s latest update introduces several more handy upgrades, including a new way to set goals that steer chat behavior. In a blog post today, Google said it’s rolling out a bunch of upgrades to NotebookLM, including this new feature for chat. You can now define a goal, voice, or role for each notebook in the same way you might give ChatGPT instructions on how to respond. For example, you might tell it to act like a research advisor, a marketing strategist, or even a game master. Once set, the chatbot maintains that tone and approach throughout the entire conversation.",
