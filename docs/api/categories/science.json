Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

    "body": "This artist’s concept depicts the protoplanet WISPIT 2b accreting matter as it orbits around its star, WISPIT 2. NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about 5 million years old, or almost 1,000 times younger than the Earth, and about 437 light-years from Earth. Being a giant and still-growing baby planet, WISPIT 2b is interesting to study on its own, but its location in this protoplanetary disk gap is even more fascinating. Protoplanetary disks are made of gas and dust that surround young star…",

The tab brings an organized feed of your progress and achievements from different games and apps. With this update, Google is also expanding semantic search using AI. The Google Play Store is, for most people, the default destination to download apps on Android devices. Over the years, it has been refined and undergone several changes to make it easier to discover more apps with fewer steps. And now, Google is seeding another updated version intended to improve app search and keep a tab on your activity and achievements across different apps and games. Google has released a new Play Store update, bumping its version to 48.2. Among the significant changes introduced by the update is a new “You” tab, which replaces the Books tab in the bottom bar. Here, you can find personalized content to help you make better use of the apps and games already installed on your phone. Although we don’t have the update yet, Google shared some information in a recent blog post that provides more details about the new tab.",
