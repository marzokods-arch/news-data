    "body": "I first encountered Wobbly Life a few months ago when searching for new games to play with my kid. It's a physics-powered open-world sim that roughly resembles a child-friendly Grand Theft Auto, a big colourful playground with activities that include races, delivering pizzas, and taking on taxi fares. My quickfire take is that it isn't as good as Human Fall Flat , but better than Totally Reliable Delivery Service and way less cursed than Roblox . At least, those were my thoughts before the 1.0 update , which expands Wobbly Life quite a bit . The launch version basically adds a second open world to the game, if you can consider outer flipping space a world, that is. Wobbly Life's cosmic expanse adds a host of celestial bodies and manmade structures for you to explore, from moons to hop around on to an elaborate station built into the side of an asteroid. These locations also afford new opportunities to earn cash. You can join the Asteroid Defence Unit and help shoot down pesky space rocks, delve into larger moonlets and mine them for minerals, or search for stranded interplanetary craft with the space rescue job. Alongside these repeatable jobs are more bespoke missions, such as be…",

    "body": "While I understand the appeal of renovation sims like House Flipper , I simply cannot bring myself to play them. The idea of spending hours fixing up a fake house seems downright perverse when I cannot find time to maintain my own real, increasingly dilapidated abode. You might say the obvious solution is to take some time off and get those many annoying odd jobs done, and you would be wrong. The solution is clearly for someone to make a game like House Flipper, but with a setting sufficiently detached from reality that I can convince myself that I am not wasting my time playing it. It is with open arms, therefore, that I welcome The Lift , a \"supernatural handyman simulator\" that takes the core premise of House Flipper but switches out its crumbling bungalows and mouldy condos for a massive, Soviet-core scientific facility. It's basically Abiotic Factor for DIY sickos, and I am already buckling up my neglected toolbelt in anticipation. You play a moustachioed engineer awakened from stasis in the bowels of the Institute, which The Lift's developer Fantastic Signals describes as \"humanity's most advanced research facility—until a catastrophic incident left it drifting through the v…",

You have a fierce need to chill with your buds, and if it happens to be in space, you'd be down with that. I assume, anyway, that's the general demographic propelling Jump Space to the top sellers list on Steam, where it's rapidly amassing players on its first day in early access. While I'm writing this, SteamDB records a 24-hour peak of 15,558 players for the co-op space adventuring game, and that's just a few hours after it went live. It's not the hundreds of thousands of players recorded by Silksong or Borderlands 4 , but early user reviews are positive. \"Initial impression is great,\" says one of the top reviews on Steam so far, written by user Iblysi. \"The performance is top notch … You jump with a ship in space. 10/10 would jump again.\" When PC Gamer Senior Editor Christopher Livingston tried Jump Space (formerly known as Jump Ship) earlier this year, he praised it for capturing some of that Sea of Thieves magic in a very different package. You crew a ship with up to three friends, playing whack-a-mole with spontaneous fires and manning the guns as necessary, but there's no PvP aspect and you're…",

Included in this drop are over 10 million people leaving the PC platform entirely. Consoles, handhelds, and mobile all offer compelling value for the budget-limited gamer.\" It's not all down to people upping and leaving, though: \"A few million entry-level defectors are not actually leaving the PC platform but are migrating to the more expensive hardware tiers of midrange and high-end PC hardware.\" JPR seems to put at least some of this down to the impending ending of support for Windows 10 : \"Never before in the history of the Microsoft Windows operating system has there been a forced hardware migration requirement.
