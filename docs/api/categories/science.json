    "body": "Finding all magazine locations for the In Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda quest is one of the first collectible hunts you'll encounter in The Outer Worlds 2 . Once you've found one volume of Science Adventure's Quarterly during your travels, you'll be directed to Redactor Quensel near Fairfield, an ex-Protectorate censor who'll reward you for finding more of the comics. There are ten volumes hidden across Paradise Island that you'll need to collect if you want all three sets of rewards that she gives. Luckily, you'll make your way to most of these locations while completing the main story and companion quests, and since Paradise Island is already quite small, it's not like it takes particularly long to get anywhere either way. All Science Adventure's Quarterly locations in The Outer Worlds 2 The Townie Clothing is the reward for finding all ten volumes (Image credit: Obsidian) There are ten magazine locations to find across Paradise Island, and you'll get rewards based on how many you bring back: One volume : The first magazine you deliver to Redactor Quensel gets you 500 bits Five volumes : You'll get another 500 bits and a Pitchball Card (+1% damage) upon delivering five Ten vol…",

    "body": "Finding the best weapons in The Outer Wilds 2 will help you overcome the gangs of space monsters, greedy corpos, and Protectorate fanatics that you'll face in your journey across Arcadia. There are plenty of strong unique weapons you can grab early in the game, whether you want a sneaky knife that gets stronger with every stealth kill, or a sniper rifle that lets you plant explosive bolts on unaware enemies before detonating them. I've included the seven strongest unique weapons you can get in the game's first region, Paradise Island, along with info on how to grab each. These range from pistols, to long arms, to melee weapons, so there should be something that'll fit every build. Kaur's Korroder (Bio-Mass Pistol) (Image credit: Obsidian) Infection : Goo fired from this pistol bounces off surfaces. Each shot also has a chance to apply a contagious corrosive condition. Chance for contagion to spread increases with science skill. This Bio-Mass Pistol is a great early grab, especially if you're levelling your science skill. As said above, it applies a contagious corrosive effect that can spread between enemies, making it good for groups. You can either get this by helping Officer Kau…",

    "body": "When it comes to PC monitors, I've been a high-DPI aficionado—OK, a high-DPI bore—since forever. So, forgive me for feeling just a touch triumphant as I report on new research that entirely vindicates my personal peccadilloes when it comes to pixel density . It turns out really high-res PC monitors are worth it, after all. Huzzah! Now, when it comes to pixel density, viewing distance and screen size are critical. Handily, researchers from Cambridge University and Meta Reality Labs (via Tomshardware ) have come up with a display resolution calculator that factors all that in, plus new data on the actual acuity of the human eye, and shows whether you're wasting your time on that fancy new monitor or TV. To work all this out, the researchers took a closer look at what the human eye is actually capable of. They found humans can discern more pixels than previously thought, but there are still limits. \"Our results demonstrate that the resolution limit is higher than what was previously believed, reaching 94 pixels per degree (ppd) for foveal achromatic vision, 89 ppd for red-green patterns, and 53 ppd for yellow-violet patterns,\" the paper published in Nature says . Pixels per degree, o…",
