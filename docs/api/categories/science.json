During their stay, Cardman, Fincke, and Yui contributed more than 850 hours of research to help prepare humanity for the return to the Moon and future missions to Mars, while improving life back on Earth. Here&#8217;s a glimpse into the science completed during the Crew-11 mission: Bolstering bone resilience NASA astronaut Zena Cardman works with bone stem cells aboard the International Space Station to improve our understanding of how bone loss occurs during spaceflight. Studying bone cell activity in microgravity could help researchers learn how to control bone loss&nbsp;to protect astronauts’ bone density during future long-duration space missions and inform treatments for diseases like osteoporosis on Earth.&nbsp; Learn more about MABL-B .
