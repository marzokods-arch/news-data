    "body": "Ultra-short-throw (UST) projectors are meant to be a practical alternative to massive TVs. They promise big-screen immersion without permanent installations, and I appreciate not having to climb a ladder to mount anything to my ceiling. The irony is that the best UST projectors still require something many homes don’t have: space. After a week with AWOL Vision’s Aetherion Max, it became clear that I don’t have a room with a wall large enough, or a layout flexible enough, to fully take advantage of what this projector can do. And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Researchers found a way to hide malicious instructions within a normal Google Calendar invite that Gemini can unknowingly execute. When users asked Gemini about their schedule, it could be tricked into summarizing their private meetings and leaking that data into a new event. Google was duly notified and has added new protections, but the issue highlights how AI features can be abused through natural language. Google recently made Gemini a lot more useful by letting it work across multiple Calendars , not just your primary one. You can now ask about events or create new meetings across secondary calendars using natural language. But just as that update rolled out, security researchers shared a worrying new finding about how Gemini can be exploited to access someone’s private and confidential Calendar information.",

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls NASA will observe its annual Day of Remembrance on Thursday, Jan. 22, which includes commemorating the crews of Apollo 1 and the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia. The event is traditionally held every year on the fourth Thursday of January, as all three astronaut accidents happened around the end of the month. “On NASA’s Day of Remembrance, we pause to honor the members of the NASA family who lost their lives while pushing the boundaries of exploration and discovery,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We remember them not to retreat from risk, but to respect it — to learn, to improve, and continue onward. Their sacrifice and the strength of their families will forever inspire us as we continue to reach for the stars and pursue the secrets of the universe.” Isaacman will lead an observance at 1 p.m. EST at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia,…",

Watson (University of Rochester); Processing: Gladys Kober (NASA/Catholic University of America) A disparate collection of young stellar objects bejewels a cosmic panorama in the star-forming region NGC 1333 in this new image from NASA’s&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope . To the left, an actively forming star called a protostar casts its glow on the surrounding gas and dust, creating a reflection nebula. Two dark stripes on opposite sides of the bright point (upper left) are its protoplanetary disk, a region where planets could form, and the disk’s shadow, cast across the large envelope of material around the star. Material accumulates onto the protostar through this rotating disk of gas and dust, a product of the collapsing cloud of gas and dust that gave birth to the star. Where the shadow stops and the disk begins is presently unknown. To the center right, an outflow cavity reveals a fan-shaped reflection nebula. The two stars at its base, HBC 340 (lower) and HBC 341 (upper), unleash stellar winds, or material flowin…",
