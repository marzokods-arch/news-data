    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus announced that its Android 16-based Oxygen OS 16 update will launch on October 16, 2025. The new platform update will feature Gemini integration, allowing the AI to access content saved in Mind Space for recall and further building up. Android 16 has been out for several months for Pixel users, weeks for several Galaxy and (surprisingly) Motorola and Sony users , but nowhere to be found for the rest of the Android gang. The abysmally slow rollout of Android 16 leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially when you glance over to the other side of the fence and see every single currently supported Apple device already receiving the latest update. Thankfully, it seems the Android crew is finally pulling up, as OnePlus has now announced that Oxygen OS 16 is coming this month. Donâ€™t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
