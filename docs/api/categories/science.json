On Baltoro Glacier, red areas, indicating high ice velocities, propagate slowly downslope throughout the melting season. NASA/Chad Greene For the first time, scientists have created a comprehensive global dataset revealing how the world’s glaciers speed up and slow down with the seasons. Published in Science in November 2025, this groundbreaking study analyzed over 36 million satellite image pairs—including decades of Landsat data—to track the seasonal “pulse” of every major glacier on Earth. The research, built off the ITS_LIVE ice velocity dataset from NASA’s Jet Propuls…",

The agency concluded a wet dress rehearsal for the agency’s Artemis II test flight early Tuesday morning, successfully loading cryogenic propellant into the SLS (Space Launch System) tanks, sending a team out to the launch pad to closeout Orion, and safely draining the rocket. The wet dress rehearsal was a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket, designed to identify any issues and resolve them before attempting a launch. To allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal, NASA now will target&nbsp; March &nbsp;as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.
