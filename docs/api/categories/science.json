    "body": "Predicted 3D structures of the ancestral nitrogenase DDKK complex from oldest to modern. University of Wisconsin-Madison/Holly Rucker NASA-supported scientists have resurrected an enzyme first used by organisms on Earth 3.2-billion years ago and, in the process, have validated a chemical biosignature in rocks that is used to understand ancient life on Earth. The research provides a new understanding of what Earth’s biosphere was like early in our planet’s history and confirms a reliable biosignature that could be used by robotic or human explorers to look for signs of ancient life on other worlds. Nitrogen, Earth’s biosphere The study , published in Nature Communications on Jan. 22 , focuses on a type of metabolism called nitrogen fixation, or diazotrophy. This process is what converts biologically unusable nitrogen in Earth’s atmosphere into molecules that all living organisms use to survive. On Earth, there is a select group of organisms called diazotrophs that can perform nitrogen fixation. This group is a motley crew of bacteria (and a few archaea and eukaryotes) that are found dotted across different branches of the tree of life. Some diazotrophs are free-living organisms tha…",
