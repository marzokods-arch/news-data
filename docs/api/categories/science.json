Earlier this year, scientists used NASA’s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarization Explorer) to study a white dwarf star and its X-ray polarization. MIT/Jose-Luis Olivares By Michael Allen &nbsp; &nbsp; For the first time, scientists have used NASA’s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarization Explorer) to study a white dwarf star. Using IXPE’s unique X-ray polarization capability, astronomers examined a star called the intermediate polar EX Hydrae, unlocking the geometry of energetic binary systems.&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2024, IXPE spent nearly one week focused on EX Hydrae, a white dwarf star system located in the constellation Hydra, approximately 200 light-years from Earth.

NASA interns take on meaningful work and contribute to exciting agency projects with the guidance of a supportive mentor. The agency&#8217;s internship program regularly ranks as the nation’s most prestigious and competition is steep: in fiscal year 2025, NASA&#8217;s Office of STEM Engagement received about 250,000 internship applications for its roughly 1,800 internship opportunities. To give you the best shot at a NASA internship, we’ve compiled a list of tips mentors say can make an application stand out from the crowd. It is NASA’s mentors who create internship project descriptions, review applications, and take the lead in choosing candidates to work on their specific internship projects.
