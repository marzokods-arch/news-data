    "body": "Today we got our first look at gameplay from Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions, the next game from Astroneer developer System Era Softworks and published by Devolver Digital. It looks like a lot of fun, though I do have a couple reservations right out of the gate. Beginning at a space station crammed with astronauts, up to four players can embark on missions together, visiting a weirdo planet for some co-op chaos that includes completing objectives, battling alien lifeforms, and collecting \"space loot.\" You can glide across colorful landscapes, swim through alien oceans, and have encounters with everything from monstrous extraterrestrial brutes to harmless sentient carrots. Your tools let you deform the alien planet, too: tunneling through the ground, building land bridges to cross gaps, and aiming water nozzles to \"de-goop\" important scientific equipment that the local fauna has gummed up. When a mission has been completed, you return to the space station and prepare for the next expedition. That all looks like a good time, but where I'm a bit iffy on Starseeker is that every mission is on a timer. \"The clock starts ticking the second you step out of your landing shuttle,\" says S…",

    "body": "The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to three scientists for their path-finding work in the field of quantum mechanics. It's been a long time coming—three whole decades, in fact—but that's seemingly how long it took to recognize that work was pivotal to the development of a whole lot of technology since the 1980s. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the news in Stockholm, Sweden. Professor John Clarke, Professor Michel H. Devoret and Professor John M. Martinis are the new Nobel laureates. Clarke is from the UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley; Devoret is from Paris, France and works at Yale; Martinis is American and works at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Nobel prize specifically relates to work done by the trio in 1984-1985 in a series of experiments on electrical circuits. In the words of the committee, these led to \"the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit.\" You what now. We're in the field of quantum mechanics here, which I'll freely admit befuddles me, though the Nobel citation does give as simple as explanation as it can of what the trio actually ach…",
