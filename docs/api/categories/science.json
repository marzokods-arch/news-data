As part of the new collaboration with Fortnite , the French duo has released a new video for track &#8220;Contact,&#8221; the epic closer of its 2013 Grammy-winning album, Random Access Memories . The new animated clip finds the robots careening through space and borrows imagery from Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem , the 2003 anime film created as a companion piece for the duo&#8217;s 2001 album, Discovery . The new music video also uses a trimmed version of the song, which in this video version clocks in at four minutes and 48 seconds, down from the six-minute and 23 second original. Created by Epic Games and Magnopus, the visual comes as part of the new Daft Punk Experience that launched in Fortnite in September.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR A study found no clear link between bedtime phone use and poor sleep in adults. Both regular and occasional bedtime scrollers reported better sleep than moderate users. Researchers say age and how you use your phone may matter more than blue light itself. For years, we’ve been warned to ditch our phones well before bedtime, with experts saying the blue light is likely to be detrimental to our sleep quality. Turns out, you might not have to feel so guilty about that final scroll after all.
