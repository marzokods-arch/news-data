    "body": "Credit: Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus has announced that Mind Space is getting Google Gemini integration. The feature will be available on OnePlus flagship devices on Oxygen OS 16. While investigating a beta of the Google app back in August, we discovered strings of code referencing Gemini and OnePlus’ Mind Space feature. At the time, we didn’t know when this integration would happen, but we did know it would allow Google’s AI to access content stored in Mind Space. Today, the company’s Indian branch made this integration official. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
