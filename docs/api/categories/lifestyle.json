    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Google’s new Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger may be missing one feature depending on where you buy it. Users on Reddit point out that the charger’s prongs don’t fold as advertised on Google’s website and Amazon. The lack of foldable prongs may be limited to specific regions, though. Google’s new Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger is surely one of the best accessories you can buy for your Pixel 10 phone. The $59.99 USB-C fast charger uses proprietary tech that can not only prioritize charging your Pixel but also charge a second device simultaneously. Another small but cool advantage of the charger is that it’s supposed to be very travel-friendly, with prongs that fold inside, making it easy to carry around in a small bag without the prongs awkwardly poking out.",
