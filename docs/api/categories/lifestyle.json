    "body": "Between high-profile collaborations, long-awaited retro returns, and thoughtful reinterpretations of classic silhouettes, 2025 has been an outstanding year for sneakers, as the culture felt both reflective and forward-moving. Some of the most legendary shoes in history made returns this year: the Air Jordan 1 High ’85 “Bred” came back in true OG form, the Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 finally reentered the conversation after only 72 pairs released back in 2005. Nike brought back one of its most iconic releases with the Air Foamposite One “Galaxy.” We also saw the return of the coveted “big bubble” on the Nike Air Max 95, as nostalgia reigned supreme in 2025. The year also marked a refreshing change for sneaker enthusiasts, though. For once, many highly anticipated releases didn’t immediately sell out.
