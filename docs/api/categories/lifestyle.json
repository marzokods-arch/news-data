    "body": "Travel routers definitely have their place in the market. However, some of the primary benefits of travel routers can be easily replicated by the Android flagship in your pocket, and it might help you save money on your next trip. One big complaint when traveling is that hotels, cruises, and airlines often charge for internet on a per-device basis. The first and second devices are usually provided with free Wi-Fi, but you have to start paying if you want to connect additional devices. Even when I travel alone, I frequently end up with four personal devices (two phones, a laptop, and a tablet), so I have to ration the internet connection among them. The situation worsens if I am traveling with family and friends.",
