Yet every year at the US border, Customs agents go through tens of thousands of devices, taking advantage of the weakened legal protections afforded to travelers. If that sounds bad to you, we’ve got some even more upsetting news, as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) device searches are increasing at a disturbing rate.
