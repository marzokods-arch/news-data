    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google could soon enhance the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature with integrations for Google Wallet and Google Tasks. Google Wallet integration could enable the AI to display live status updates for trains, flights, and events, making Magic Cue far more proactive. Google Tasks integration could make event reminders clearer by allowing direct access outside of Calendar. Magic Cue was one of Pixel 10’s highlight features, but it fell pretty flat at launch . Eventually, Google redeemed itself as Magic Cue improved , and while it may not be a groundbreaking new feature, it certainly has a place within the Pixel ecosystem. Google seems to have bigger plans for Magic Cue, as it could be looking to further upgrade it with Google Wallet and Google Tasks integration.
