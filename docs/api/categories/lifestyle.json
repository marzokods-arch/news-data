    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s latest app version includes code suggesting users may be able to attach map regions to prompts in Gemini. This functionality would enhance location-based queries by allowing users to visually select areas rather than typing place names. “Explore this area,” and similar commands hint at an integration that enables users to discover nearby places with one-tap interactions. One of the biggest advantages of Gemini is its conversational ability . Users can ask questions in natural language and imperfect commands, and Gemini will do its best to return a result. Google built on this advantage by allowing users to attach all sorts of files and media to Gemini to get even better, more personalized answers. Soon, Gemini could allow users to attach a map region to their prompt, opening the door for Gemini to become your personal travel guide.
