It has flexible plans, good coverage, limited data throttling, and fair pricing. There’s really not much to complain about. One of the key benefits we often highlight for Google Fi is its international service. Whether you buy international data by the GB with the Flexible plan or need unlimited data with the Unlimited Premium plan, Fi offers some of the most robust international coverage for an MVNO.",
