Amid efforts to cap profits on ticket resales, StubHub shares are down 47.1% from the company&#8217;s Sept. 16 IPO price, and Vivid Seats shares have fallen 91.8% this year. Ticketmaster operates a secondary market, but the company encourages artists to raise the price of primary tickets to capture revenue that would otherwise go to scalpers.
