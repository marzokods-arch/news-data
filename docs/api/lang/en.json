Fleetwood Mac first released “Landslide” in July 1975 on its self-titled 10th studio album — the group’s first project featuring Stevie Nicks as a vocalist and Lindsey Buckingham as a guitarist. Nicks solely wrote the song and delivers its lead vocals. Despite becoming one of the band’s most enduring compositions, “Landslide” was never issued as an official single during its original run. Still, it remained a staple of Fleetwood Mac’s live performances, as well as Nicks’ solo tours. A live version was released as a single in 1997, following its inclusion on the band’s album The Dance . That rendition debuted on the Hot 100 in July 1998 and peaked at No. 51 that August, while also reaching No. 10 on Adult Contemporary and No. 26 …",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has removed its egg-hatching mini-game from the Gaming Hub app for its Android devices. The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively.

As it gets ready for that hardware, we’re taking a look at the companion software that will exist on the phone side. Features in development include an audio-only mode, conversation detection to mute notifications, and privacy-protecting camera tools. At CES this year, smart glasses were everywhere , and if you haven’t tried a pair on yet, you’ll probably have the chance to soon. But for all the great progress we’re seeing across all things XR, we’re easily most excited about what’s coming next from Google. As we get ready to experience all the flavors of Google’s latest attempt at making smart glasses work , we’re getting an early peek at the software that may make this all possible.

It addresses shipping delays, poor customer service, quality control, and more. The company has also delayed the Pocket Play campaign while it works to implement the changes. AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott. After a poorly received initial response , AYANEO’s CEO stepped in to provide a full statement and “ Service Improvement Plan ” to turn things around in 2026.",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

It almost goes without saying that you shouldn’t let strangers use your phone for any claimed reason. All smartphones have an IMEI number , which is effectively the phone’s ID number. Unfortunately, cybercriminals and other bad actors often steal IMEI numbers to facilitate crimes. Now, a Redditor has outlined a rather crazy IMEI scam. Redditor Prudent-Vacation-581 reported that a person with Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses recently asked to make a call from their phone. The Redditor reported that the stranger instead dialed *#06#, which reveals the device’s IMEI number, gave the phone back, and “ran away.” The user received a pop-up on their phone the following day, noting that the device is now unlocked.",

Even the early beta catalog gave me access to far more music than I could ever hope to fit on my iPod Nano, and, more importantly, made discovering new artists and exploring new genres unbelievably easy. Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer. Unsurprisingly, it’s driven by that most modern of problems: AI slop.",

However, I’m an even bigger fan of self-hosting — I use my DIY NAS to replace a considerable range of overpriced subscription services. However, so far, I haven’t been able to replace Google Photos completely, but I might have finally found a way to truly cut the cord. See, I’m loath to fork out for Google One when I have 10TB of hard drive space on my NAS. Still, I use Google Photos to make the occasional quick edit, to help share snaps with friends and family quickly, and even duplicate a few of my most cherished memories as part of the recommended 3-2-1 backup rule . For storing most of my older snaps, I’ve been using PhotoPrism, but as good as it is as a photo library, it lacks the rich feature set of Photos, especially for managing multiple users in my home.",

Most smart glasses aren’t explicitly made to be accessibility tools, but it’s easy to imagine ways they could be used to that end. Take Meta’s conversation focus, which uses smart glasses’ built-in speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to in noisy environments. The feature was announced months ago, but now, it’s rolling out in a limited test. Meta announced its conversation focus feature at the company’s Connect event in September, and users have been able to sign up for a waitlist to try it since December.

The V1TAL is easily the most polarizing of the two, so let’s start there. I saw the V1TAL behind closed doors at last year’s CES, but this was the first time I could photograph it and see it more thoroughly.

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down.
