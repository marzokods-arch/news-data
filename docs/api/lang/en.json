Google’s Gemma large-language model was introduced as a next-gen AI companion inside its AI Studio platform, designed to support developers with text generation, creative drafts, summaries, and more. It represented Google’s broader push toward open experimentation with its advanced models, until everything hit a snag. Google has now quietly pulled Gemma from the public developer interface. First reported by TechCrunch , the move follows a formal letter to CEO Sundar Pichai from Senator Marsha Blackburn , a Republican from Tennessee, who said Gemma produced a fabricated allegation when prompted with: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?”",

Shipping will begin before December 15, with prices increasing after that. The Nintendo DS was a groundbreaking console when it launched more than two decades ago, but there are vanishingly few ways to play DS games on modern hardware. ANBERNIC is here to change that with the RG DS, and it’s now available for pre-order at a surprisingly low price. With two 4-inch IPS displays and a clamshell form factor, the RG DS is roughly the same physical size as the Nintendo DSi LL, but features two additional sticks on either side of the bottom screen. The screens themselves have a resolution of 640×480, which is higher than the original consoles, but doesn’t offer perfect integer scaling. In other words, some games with pixel graphics may look a little off to the discerning eye.",

This platform update is significant, as it introduces new features, including the Now Bar and revamped watch tiles, to existing smartwatch users.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

While the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus are more of the same, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could get rounded corners for its display. This leak corroborates previous design leaks that suggested that the Galaxy S254 Ultra is ditching its boxy design. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series is in a bit of a pre-release upheaval. After all the drama around the Galaxy S26 Edge , we’re back to the usual three Galaxy S series flagships, but now on a delayed timeline as the company scrambles to get the Galaxy S26 Plus going on time. Leaks suggest that Samsung will hold its Unpacked event in San Francisco on February 25, 2026 . While we wait for the company to make any related announcement, we’re now back to the usual phone leaks, this time giving us a fair idea of the shape of the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s display.

New logos or app icons typically mark significant shifts in identity for brands. In 2020, Google refreshed the icons — which have confused users to date — for several of its apps to highlight the more connected experiences across apps. More recently, it has been transitioning to new logos that depict its shift towards AI . Following the recent changes to the logos, along with app icons, for the Google and Home apps on Android , the tech giant appears to be preparing for a wider refresh. Two more apps may soon receive their own versions of new icons with a more fluid, gradientized appearance: Google Photos and Maps.",

Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite powers the Galaxy S25 series, while Exynos has stepped aside to fill in for some of Samsung’s more affordable phones, such as the FE range. This is because the Exynos 2500 suffered some rather notable issues. First, production yield issues and delays meant Samsung had to skip the chip entirely for the Galaxy S25 series . When it finally arrived in the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the performance was pretty lackluster; in CPU performance, it was no faster than last year’s Snapdragon rival, and there were only marginal gains in graphics.",

A desk charger like the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand , a magnetic wallet, a MagSafe-compatible tripod — all of these are good ideas. But the one accessory I was personally looking forward to the most is a Qi2 power bank. Just snap it on the back of my phone and get a relatively fast charge without any wires or tangles. I ended up with several of these portable batteries to test out, and while I do appreciate their convenience, one thing stood out in all of my tests: You should really be wary of the battery’s capacity. 10,000mAh won’t be enough to charge your ~5,000mAh Pixel 10, 10 Pro, or 10 Pro XL more than once.",

    "summary": "Android almost had its own IRS that would audit apps for their battery usage. Here’s how it would’ve worked.",
    "body": "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Google restricting background work. With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

Verizon’s rivals are doing well, but Big Red finds itself in a much less rosy position. While it did manage to add more than 40,000 new subscribers this quarter, those gains came entirely from its prepaid and business divisions. Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

As enamored by the Pixel as I was, I stopped using Pixels for over six years, and with good reason. The Pixel 10 Pro , though, is the phone I’ve been waiting for Google to make. What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

The past ten months have got to be the start of one of the most embarrassing years for tech heavyweights in recent memory. One after the other, firms like Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, and of course, Google, have been prostrating themselves before a government administration they’d previously butted heads with . But in 2025, acquiescence is the name of the game, and rather than bracing for another four years of conflict, they’ve instead been kissing the ring. A few weeks back, that extended to YouTube performing a massive about-face on the necessary steps it had taken to ban some of the worst voices on its platform , spreading lies, hate, and disinformation — instead opening the door to restore their access. That move was telegraphed in late September when Alphabet legal counsel submitted a letter to the House Committee on the Judiciary, blaming COVID-era YouTube moderation policies on pressure the co…",

Google’s keenly aware of that: It offers a version of the YouTube app that’s explicitly made for children’s content in YouTube Kids, and earlier this year, rolled out a controversial AI-based age estimation system to automatically flag accounts that may be used by minors. These measures are meant in part to help Google avoid legal trouble — like a 2019 class-action suit filed in California accusing Google and YouTube of violating privacy laws by collecting information about minors for the purposes of advertising. The suit was eventually settled for a sum of $30 million, and now, according to Top Class Actions , affected users are able to submit claims to get a cut of that settlement.",

That process can be wildly complex, as in the case of generative video — but on the simpler end of the spectrum, AI can be very helpful for parsing large bodies of text to create concise summaries. Google’s started putting its AI to work in the latter way on the Play Store, where you’ll soon see AI-generated summaries of aggregated user app reviews.

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S .

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

    "body": "TL;DR Verizon support pages say that S22 series phones purchased from the carrier are now eligible to download One UI 8. Several comments on Reddit point to S22 phones also getting the update on AT&amp;T. The rollout status of One UI 8 for unlocked S22 phones is unclear. One UI 8 has been making its way to Samsung phones in fits and starts for a few weeks now. The rollout has hit major milestone this week, with the Galaxy S22 series now receiving the update on multiple carriers in the US. Verizon has updated support pages for the Galaxy S22, S22+, and S22 Ultra to show that, starting today, each is eligible to download Android 16-based One UI 8 along with the October Android security patch. This comes after Samsung started and then paused One UI 8 distribution for international S22, S23, and S24 phones earlier this month.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR AT&amp;T recently launched an ad campaign that uses the BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division findings to criticize T-Mobile for “un-truths.” The NAD has ordered AT&amp;T to remove the promotional material, which it says violates ad-industry rules. The carrier has now filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the self-regulatory body. You may have caught the commercial by now, where AT&amp;T uses Luke Wilson to talk about T-Mobile as a “master of breaking promises.” The commercial in question highlights the Un-Carrier’s deceptive ads and other transgressions. It’s maybe one of the most direct attacks AT&amp;T has taken against a rival in a long time. Now AT&amp;T is fighting for the right to keep its campaign up.

    "summary": "Android 17 could introduce a new “Min Mode” feature that lets apps display custom interfaces on the AOD.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new “Min Mode” feature for the Always-On Display that will allow apps to show their own minimal, persistent interfaces. This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.
