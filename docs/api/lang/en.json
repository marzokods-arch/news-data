    "body": "chilldspot dropped its third album, entitled handmade Wednesday (Sept. 24). The three-member band from Japan signed with the Chinese label MODERN SKY last year, stepping up its presence in the region. With headlining concerts and festival slots fueling a steady rise in recognition and popularity, chilldspot’s stage is expanding further than ever before. At the same time, the departure of a member proved a pivotal moment, shaping chilldspot into an even tougher, more tightly knit collective. Brimming with a variety of sounds and uplifting words, handmade stands as proof of the band’s growth. Billboard Japan spoke with the three members — Hiyune, Ryozan, and Kozaki — about the journey that led to this album in this latest interview. chilldspot’s live shows have been growing in scale, and you’ve even played overseas festivals, expanding your activities in ways you probably hadn’t quite imagined. How does that feel? Hiyune (vocals &amp; guitar): Being in Japan, it almost feels unreal, but seeing tickets for our Beijing solo show sell out instantly, and playing festivals where, of course, we’re not the only draw, yet the stages have grown to hold thousands of people… I don’t know the e…",

On Jan. 19, 2023, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings announced his transition to executive chairman and the appointment of co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters .

In the two and a half years before Netflix’s announcement, Hastings had delegated more responsibilities to Sarandos and Peters, who had each been with Netflix for 15 years.
