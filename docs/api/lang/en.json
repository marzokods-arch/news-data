    "body": "The upcoming Michael Jackson biopic Michael has already made history — and it hasn’t even hit cinemas yet. The teaser trailer for the Antoine Fuqua-directed film racked up more than 116.2 million views within its first 24 hours, making it the most-viewed music biopic trailer of all time and the largest trailer launch in Lionsgate history, according to analytics firm WaveMetrix. It now sits ahead of previous record holders including Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (96.1 million) and Bob Marley: One Love (60.1 million). Set to premiere in theaters on April 24, 2026, Michael stars Jaafar Jackson — the late King of Pop’s nephew — in the lead role. The film promises to explore Michael Jackson’s complex legacy through both iconic performances and personal moments. “I’m humbled and honored to bring my Uncle Michael’s story to life,” Jaafar Jackson wrote on Instagram. “To all the fans all over the world, I’ll see you soon.” Producer Graham King, who spearheaded 2018’s Bohemian Rhapsody , said Jaafar was the clear choice for the role after an extensive casting process. “I met Jaafar over two years ago and was blown away by the way he organically personifies the spirit and personality of Michae…",

It’s one of the highest-attended rock tours in Australia this year — and one with lasting impact. “Thanks for putting up with us.

In Melbourne, seismic sensors at the Seismology Research Centre reportedly picked up tremors during the band’s performances — a rare but real phenomenon caused by thousands of fans stomping and singing in unison. One of the city’s most iconic live music venues, Cherry Bar, credited the band with sparking a major nightlife revival. “The darkest hour is before the dawn, Melbourne and Cherry Bar needed a hero and who knew that it would come in the shape of a couple of …",

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic – for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us.

All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

The band’s eponymous debut album reached No. 1 in the issue dated Sept. 28, 1974, dethroning Stevie Wonder ’s Fulfillingness’ First Finale , which had led the previous two weeks. Three of the acts on this list reached the top spot with their first solo albums, after tenures with successful groups. Paul McCartney ’s first solo album reached No. 1 in 1970, following six years of unprecedented success on the Billboard 200 with The Beatles. Stevie Nicks topped the chart in 1981 (following three studio albums with Fleetwood Mac), as did George Michael in 1988 (following three studio albums with Wham!).

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 41-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career.

However, as is often the case in life, what’s easiest isn’t always the best, and this is especially true for smartphone apps that non-tech-savvy users might employ.

Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI.

That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

    "body": "Music collecting and appreciation is a deeply personal hobby. It’s something very important to me and serves as a snapshot of time and place. Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

I wear mine only while working out, or occasionally when I’m away from my phone for a bit — like when it’s in another room — to avoid missing calls or notifications. That’s it. That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses. And even though I’m not too fond of making every wearable “smart,” if glasses could handle nutrition tracking for me, I’d happily throw my wallet at them.",

While the user’s own survival is what matters, the story again highlights the durability of modern devices, following earlier examples of Android endurance. When Typhoon Kalmaegi tore through the Philippines this week, it left catastrophic damage in its wake. Tragically, many lives were lost, entire homes were destroyed, and communities were left to rebuild from scratch. Amidst the devastation, one Reddit user shared an incredible story of their own survival, as well as that of their iPhone, adding to a growing list of phones that have beaten the survival odds recently.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Unlike traditional minimalist wallpapers, Niagara is bringing several new intricately designed illustrations for wallpapers. The update also improves backup features and adds Bing as a search engine option. Niagara Launcher is one of the most distinct Android launchers , and its impact extends beyond its visual characteristics. Having used it for over two years, I can confirm that it alters — in a good way — how you approach the app drawer. I now install it on all the phones I review and strongly recommend it too. However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update. In July, the developers of the launcher introduced a new theme playground , enabling users to experiment with various clock styles, wallpapers, and colors. Now, Niagara Launcher is getting another visual upgrade with a host of new themes, icon packs, wall…",

On the plus side, I’d been looking for an excuse to test out the dedicated “Fireworks” mode in the OnePlus 13 and OPPO Find X8 Pro (I’m using the latter) camera apps. The mode seems to combine long and short exposures, providing vivid detail with well-exposed lighting and colors. Given that I probably wouldn’t have time to optimize shutter speed and ISO while keeping an eye on the little ones, this mode would do all the heavy lifting for me.",

Pixel phones might be getting theme packs and prioritized notifications in a future Pixel Drop, and Google is releasing a new app ahead of time. Theme packs were already in the works as of early October, when Android Authority managed to surface a new “Themes” entry in the Settings app on Google Pixel phones. Now, Google published a new “Theme packs” app on the Google Play Store, exclusively for Pixels. Theme packs will make it possible to “personalize your Pixel in one tap,” according to the Play Store listing . “Instantly unlock a complete refresh that updates your wallpaper, icons, sounds, GIFs, and more with seasonal theme packs.”",

It may support 8K HDR10+ video recording at 60fps and 4K at 120fps. The image signal processor may also be 30% more power efficient than the Exynos 2400’s ISP. Although the Galaxy S25 series is exclusively powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon silicon, Samsung is expected to bring its Exynos chips back for its 2026 phones. We have heard some interesting information about the Exynos 2600, like having a “heat pass block” to keep the chip’s temperature down.

Last month, a surprise update arrived supposedly based on previously prepared code. This week it’s followed by a new update, including bug fixes and stability improvements. Earlier this year, fans of the popular Nova Launcher found themselves waking up to some bad news. Back in September, developer Kevin Barry shared that he had finally left Branch Metrics, the firm which acquired the launcher in 2022. While that looked like the end of the road for Nova Launcher , just last week users started noticing a new 8.1.3 update hitting their devices — and now it’s already being joined by a new release.

    "summary": "Google sets the record straight on what those bars really represent.",
    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",
