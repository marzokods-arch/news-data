Working in music and film through my entire professional career, I’ve seen, experienced, and worked with a multitude of creatives, and I’ve found that what it takes to be a modern creative is the ability to effectively build and tap into one’s own creative conduit. Your creative conduit provides you with the diversity of thought, new ideas, experiences and perspectives that bring your projects to the next level. Once it’s properly nurtured, the limits to your creativity will no longer exist. While building it will take time and purposeful actions, you’re going to see the results in ways you never imagined.

Been seeing bizarre, AI-generated headlines in Google Discover? That’s not an accident, Google says.

These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith .

NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide the deepest-ever view of this zone, revealing stars, planets, and unique objects that resist definition. Based on the input of astronomers from across the globe, the Roman Space Telescope will spend three-quarters of its five-year primary mission conducting three revolutionary surveys of unprecedented scale. Their combined results will transform all areas of astronomy and answer longstanding questions about dark matter, dark energy, and planets outside of our solar system, called exoplanets. That last theme will be addressed by the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey, which will peer into the center of our galaxy to study the stars and exoplanets that make up the densely populated region around the center of the Milky Way, known as the galactic bulge. This infographic describes the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey that will be conducted by NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

We saw this change in development last year, but it seems to be rolling out broadly this week. Back in November, we spotted that Google was cooking up a new light theme for the image editor in Google Photos. At the time, enabling this look took some tinkering — but now, the new light theme is rolling out publicly in multiple versions of the Photos Android app. The editing view for Google Photos has historically featured a dark gray background. That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

The operations team determined the issue arose when TESS slewed to point at a target, but its solar panels did not rotate to remain pointed at the Sun relative to the spacecraft’s new direction. The off-Sun angle of the solar arrays resulted in a slow discharge of TESS’s batteries. As designed and planned for in situations of this kind, the satellite entered a safe mode after detecting the low-power condition. At the time of the safe mode, TESS was conducting a week-long observation of comet 3I/ATLAS and resumed those observations Jan. 18.

It is currently unclear if Samsung will replace its own dialer with the Google Phone app or if the feature will work as a user-installed app. One of the best Pixel features is Scam Detection . Introduced with the Pixel 9 series, Scam Detection notifies users about potential scams as they occur. This is done for phone calls, text messages , and even chat apps . So far, Scam Detection has been a Pixel-only feature, but it seems the feature could finally be losing that exclusivity, potentially starting with the upcoming Galaxy S26 series.

For many of us, Google Wallet has become the ever-growing storehouse for not just our credit or debit cards but also our passes, IDs, vouchers, and virtually everything else that needs to be conserved digitally. However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time. A little over a year ago, we saw Wallet’s Search UI in its early form . Now, we’re getting a preview of a more functional version, along with elements that align with Google’s Material 3 Expressive philosophy.

A global launch is not yet confirmed, but if it pans out, it could potentially democratize Bluetooth trackers and significantly boost Android’s Find Hub network. We’ve seen a handful of Android-compatible Bluetooth trackers released over the years, but the market is largely untapped, if Apple’s success with AirTags is any indication. Motorola recently announced its Moto Tag 2 tracker, but there’s still plenty of space in the market for other Android brands to launch their offerings. It seems Xiaomi has decided to finally enter this space, as a new leak shows off the upcoming Xiaomi Tag. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

If you didn’t like a software update, you could revert to the previous version. Or, if you just wanted to tinker around with hardware you owned, you could. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

We’ve been less than impressed with Now Brief , finding that it rarely has anything of use to show you. On a recent work trip to London, I decided to put some effort into making it useful, and to my surprise, I was successful. Now Brief tries to be a travel companion Of all of the things Now Brief is supposed to be able to do, I wanted it to show me ETAs for upcoming events. The idea is simple — Now Brief looks at calendar events with a tagged location, checks where you are, and then works out when you should leave to get there on time. If that sounds familiar to you, that’s probably because that’s one of the many useful things that Google Now did back in the day.",

We first previewed this update late last year, and it’s now generally available. Back in October, we got an early look at a new device setup workflow in Google Home. The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

Following an initial tease in September, pre-orders are now open for the company’s Talking Flower toy. Based on a chatty character from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the gadget will pipe up every half hour or so to tell you the time, quote lines from the game, or just kind of say whatever. An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

Now, Google is bringing that same memory upgrade to the search bar. Starting today, Google is expanding Personal Intelligence to AI Mode in Search .

Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time.

While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well.

Below are the top devices I would recommend to anyone looking for the best fitness tracker available. Fitbit Charge 6: The best fitness tracker overall (band-style) The best band-style fitness tracker comes from one of the oldest players in the game, Fitbit. Though now acquired by Google, the platform still offers fantastic wellness tracking and a user-friendly companion app. The Fitbit Charge 6 offers key upgrades to the fan-favorite Charge line. Most importantly, I have found the lightweight tracker extremely comfortable for workouts and sleep, and I love the colorful AMOLED display for reading stats.

The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

In addition to desktop support for Android, Linux Debian, and Windows 11, there’s full mobile compatibility, including a custom Windows UI. Shipments are expected to get started in Q3 2026, with the hardware going for a reasonably affordable $549. Ever since smartphones started getting really powerful, some of us have been wondering why we need so many other computers in our lives. Instead of a smartphone, plus a laptop, and maybe even a desktop computer at home, couldn’t we have this one convenient, portable handset just act as our primary computing device, and connect it to larger screens, keyboards, and mice as we liked? Companies have been trying to offer just that sort of experience for well over a decade now — to varying degrees of success — and now we’re checking out the latest attempt from Nex Computer: the NexPhone .

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning. The poll also invited you to suggest your own ideas in the comments. Plenty of you weighed in, giving us a pretty clear picture of where Pixel fans think Google could up its game.

AT&amp;T wants to solve a common problem at live events: when your phone stops working as soon as the crowd arrives. The company just announced Turbo Live, a new “VIP connection” made for busy stadiums and arenas. The big news isn’t just that AT&amp;T is giving some data traffic higher priority. The carrier is also offering this fast lane to everyone, including T-Mobile and Verizon customers.",

Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.
