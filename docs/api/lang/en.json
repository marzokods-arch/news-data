    "body": "Alien Isolation is my favourite horror game, but it's too long and I think that opinion is near unanimous. When it feels like it's drawing to an end it just keeps going , and its protracted runtime is exacerbated by the fact that it's an unbearably tense experience. I adore this game, I swear I do, but boy could it have used a trim. It turns out at least one member of the original dev team agrees. In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",

It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",

A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists.

It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.\" Darkborn was originally announced in 2016 as Project Wight, but after a grisly gameplay reveal in 2019, the project was effectively cancelled in 2020 .

The game that seems to worry Activision, though? Going by the chat function in Black Ops 7, it's Arc Raiders (due out on October 30). The words \"Arc Raiders\" are censored in Black Ops 7 chat. PCG's Elie Gould tested it out, and when you try to type those words you just get a load of asterisks. Neither \"Arc\" nor \"Raiders\" is picked up like this, only the two words together. Now, there is one kink worth considering here before we all get the pitchforks out. Several months ago users reported a similar problem in the EA App chat . First of all it's surprising that anyone used chat in the EA App, but the situation here was exactly the same. Once this was noticed EA seemed to move quickly to correct the situation, and players could happily chat about Arc Raiders on the EA App from 6 August.

A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

What has looked like shooting stars or meteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere has in fact been Starlink satellites burning up in ever greater numbers. According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.

Created in actual GZDoom, the open-source Doom engine first forked all the way back in 2005, Mala Petaka is a for-real modern Doom clone that swaps out the hell and heavy metal for a lot of primary colours and some banging chiptunes. I've spent a bit of time mucking about in its demo and, my friends, it works. (Image credit: Hellforge Studios) It's also hard , or maybe I'm just bad at it. Your skull-faced protagonist, Petaka, goes from blemish-free to bloody in record time, and enemies approach you in swarms and hails of gunfire. I died. A lot. To deal with this challenge, Mala Petaka incorporates a few modern-shooter gubbins into its GZDoom framework. Most notable is a pseudo-glory-kill mechanic: whittle enemies down enough and you can eventually deliver a quick rat-a-tat of punches that turn them into a fountain of ammo and health chips.

    "body": "Monster Hunter Wilds recently added a new raid boss from Final Fantasy 14, but all this seems to have done is brought some long-running player grievances to the surface. The game's Steam reviews have been absolutely tanking and the reason will surprise no-one who's played it: performance. I'm a Monster Hunter megafan and, when it released, Wilds ran so poorly for those opening weeks that it pretty much put me off. The crossover update launched on September 29, 2025, and since then there have been just over 5,000 reviews posted, with just under 80% of those negative. The Steam reviews make for some grim reading , and what's especially notable is how many of them begin by talking about the reviewer's love for the Monster Hunter series, with the obvious comparison point of MH: World frequently used. The game's overall reviews are just about treading water at \"Mixed\" but those 5,000 \"mostly negative\" recent reviews are taking a toll. . \"The game is fun but completely overshadowed by the technical issues, which have been here since day one,\" says Sol FamilyGuy. That points to another refrain, which is that players are exasperated that the technical issues in Wilds have persisted for so…",

Intriguingly, the deal also includes OpenAI taking an up to 10% equity stake in AMD. The first 1 gigawatt tranche kicks off in the second half of next year based on AMD's next-gen Instinct MI450 AI GPU. At the same time, OpenAI will acquire the first segment of up to 160 million AMD shares. If the deal progresses right through to the final 6 gigawatt GPU power figure, OpenAI will by then have bought 160 million AMD shares accounting for roughly 10% of the company. At current values, that would be a $26 billion investment. So, it's a megabucks deal all round. It also the first really big AI GPU win of this kind for AMD, at least that we are aware of. It looks like it's big news too for the markets, as AMD's share price rocketed up 35% on the news during early trading . Kerching!

But maybe I've been missing out, because it turns out that if you determinedly skip through the cutscenes in Baby Steps —Bennett Foddy, Gabe Cuzzillo, and Maxi Boch's putting-one-foot-in-front-of-another simulator—you unlock an entire, brilliant bonus cutscene. Or punishment cutscene, depending on how you feel about the whole thing. As showcased by YouTuber Cuttyflame , successfully skipping \"around 30\" or so of the game's cutscenes—harder than it sounds: skipping cutscenes requires passing an ever-more-complex series of minigames—will eventually lead protagonist Nate to straightforwardly give up on trying to act out cutscenes towards the game's end. Rather than, you know, do a proper cutscene, Nate and chill donkey-guy Moose will acknowledge the player's lack of interest in their narrative, sit down, drop character, and embark on a cutscene that puts even Kojima to shame.

I can blame my depleting oxygen and inability to ever craft water breathing potions, but it's actually because it just feels long and unrewarding. Even when I know there's a shipwreck or temple, I will simply not go on the expedition. Minecraft's next drop, Mounts of Mayhem , provides a failsafe way to explore the ocean however, and I'm not sure I can get away with this anymore. Rather than having to rely on potions and your own ability to swim, the Nautilus will make the process of navigating the waves so much easier. These underwater mobs can be tamed with pufferfish before being saddled up and ridden by the player.

For context: In the Borderlands 4 post-game, there's a vendor called Maurice's Black Market , a vending machine that changes location every week and sells a number of legendaries that are rolled on a per-player basis. However, a recent patch introduced a bug that meant players in co-op games couldn't interact with the Maurice machines in their friends' worlds. It's a so-so system—it can be disappointing to rush to your own personal Maurice box, only to find out that none of the rolls are useful—but Pitchford does make a solid argument that this system lets communities band together to share their rolls and pick a buddy to skim good legendary weapons off. But, like, in gamer vernacular. \"Bro\", Pitchford writes, \"Get in a group of people who post their rolls every week and jump into each other’s …",

Are SSD and system memory prices poised to go the same way? According to analysis by Tom's Hardware , the unfortunate answer is yes. Tom's claims that, \"nearly every analyst firm and memory maker is now warning of looming NAND and DRAM shortages that will send SSD and memory prices skyrocketing over the coming months and years, with some even predicting a shortage that will last a decade.\" The reason, inevitably, is explosive demand for AI hardware. Tom's notes that there's some of the usual cyclical variation going on here. Following a downturn in demand in 2022 and 2023 that saw DRAM and NAND memory manufacturers selling chips below cost, manufacturing volumes were scaled back, which eventually fed through into higher prices. But more recently, the insatiable demands of AI for training and inference is requiring vast amounts of storage and memory. One AI outfit alone, OpenAI, has signed a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which could account for 40% of current global DRAM output . Meanwhile,…",

New traits, utility skills and an overhaul of the base profession mechanic means entire new builds for players to try. \"We definitely figured out that we wanted to do elite specs pretty early,\" says Cal Cohen, senior game designer for Guild Wars 2, in an interview with PC Gamer. Previous annual expansions have focused on adding new weapon options for each profession, which Cohen notes are \"a lot more specific\" in what they can do for a profession's kit. New elite specs, meanwhile, give ArenaNet a lot more options in what they can pursue. \"When we look at elite specializations, we really try to shift the profession mechanic into something more radical … so that the gameplay is significantly changed. And usually elite specs can also fill a couple of different roles. So whenever we can do elite specs, I think we want to do elite specs.\" The new set of elite specs, which are launc…",

Millennia, a Civ-like developed by C Prompt Games and published by Paradox last year just received a final update before being consigned to sink into the lone and level sand. When Phil Iwaniuk reviewed Millennia he called it \"rough-edged but worthwhile\", with complaints about its UI and AI and few other things, but praise for its way of handling progress through the ages and \"city improvement tile system.\" It sounded like the kind of game that could be significantly improved by a few additions, and while it did receive several—the final patch is update eight—it doesn't seem like enough was done to elevate it above the competition. \"With this patch,\" the announcement says, \"we are sadly coming to the end of an age. This will be the final patch for Millennia, thanks to C Prompt for their work and support of this game. We at Paradox will no longer be active on community platforms for Millennia, but you can continue counting on us for support needs, and the game will remain available to play indefinitely.\" That announcement highlights …",

Perhaps that's true when you need a game to sell in the tens of millions, but within the same period of time that both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth have failed to meet the company's lofty expectations, turn-based RPGs in general have been on such a hot streak that they're making their action contemporaries look dusty by comparison. While in Tokyo last week for TGS I played three turn-based RPGs, and I only realized in hindsight that the genre unintentionally represented most of the demo time I was able to squeeze in when not filming interviews for the PC Gaming Show . All three were fun, completely different, and embody the hot streak that turn-based RPGs have been on for at least the last year. I'm specifically thinking of more Japanese-style RPGs, here, though of course if we jump back to 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 turn-based games don't need much defending.

Enjoy Cronos on Steam, wherever you are!\" Cronos: The New Dawn was already Deck Verified at launch, but now Steam Deck and Linux players won't have to run the game through a compatibility layer. More and more games are getting native Linux support, largely due to the popularity of the Steam Deck. For instance, Hollow Knight: Silksong had native Linux support at launch last month, while one hero engineer at Larian delivered us a native version of Baldur's Gate 3 . Cronos: The New Dawn joins a growing list of over 42,000 games on Steam with Linux support. At the time of writing, over 9,000 games are Deck Verified. Currently six out of the top ten games on Steam's U.S. Top Sellers list (not including the Steam Deck itself) are either \"Playable\" or \"Verified\" on Steam Deck. Only two have native Linux support, but that's better than none. The September Steam Hardware Survey puts Linux usage at 2.68%, up from 1.92% in September 2…",

Since then I've come to the conclusion that everyone is secretly a JRPG fan—it's just about finding the right one at the right time in your life. Over the subsequent years I played all four of the Trails of Cold Steel PC ports as they were released, but it always rankled with me that if I wanted to go back to the start of the series (five games earlier) and experience the story from the beginning, I'd have to play a 21-year-old game. There is a 2014 PC port of the original Trails in the Sky , but I'd be losing out on all the combat features added over the years, a whole heap of QoL, and would have to deal with the perspective shift from full 3D to that classic chibi-sprite isometric look that older JRPGs favour.

One scripted, one very-much-not, but two watershed moments in open-world games this decade.

With that in mind, low-key Rockstar partnerships dance at the forefront of my imagination.

But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

The Northern Beaches brings a host of new quests for you to embark upon, as well as nine new dungeons, three titanic boss fights, and absolutely shedloads of rock (of the mineral kind, not the Blackpool kind ). Alongside the bosses, the stony shores are prowled by new Ichthian creatures to fight, such as the Ketos Spawn and \"shark-like Bruisers\" led by powerful commanders.

Yet while updates remained relatively consistent through last year, 2025 has been much more sporadic, with no updates in the last nine months. That's changed now, however, as Slavic Magic has finally released a new experimental beta for Manor Lords, one that brings an impressive array of new features to the city-builder. The beta patch expands the scope of Manor Lords in several directions. It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm.
