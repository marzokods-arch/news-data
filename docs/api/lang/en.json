The feature compares calendars, working hours, and conflicts, making it well-suited to group meetings. If multiple people decline an invite, Calendar can now suggest a better time to reschedule. The way it’s progressing, Google will soon know when your meeting is before you do. Back in October, it introduced the Help me schedule feature , which helped you suggest sensible meeting times based on your availability and the context of an email. That was useful, but it still left you to find out if the time worked for the other party. This latest update takes a bigger step by figuring out when everyone is actually free. According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar. When you’re creating an event, you’ll see a Suggested times option that uses Gemini to scan attendee availability, working hours, and existing conflicts, then surface the time slots that make the most sense for the whole group — assuming you have access to those calendars.

The A57 could be just 6.9mm thick, matching rumored Galaxy S26 dimensions. TENAA photos show the same vertical camera layout and Key Island buttons, now paired with what appears to be a metal frame. Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

The text prompts can be refined after your first pass, and Google will also offer suggestions. We previously spotted the custom prompt option in testing. When Google first rolled out its AI photo-to-video tools in Google Photos, the idea was nice, but the execution could feel a little hit-or-miss. You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

Back in July , YouTube Music was updated to sync playback progress between devices. At the time, that ability only worked when moving from a mobile device to the desktop web app or vice versa. Now, though, the platform will let you resume your queue from pretty much any device on any other device. As reported by 9to5Google , YouTube Music’s Now Playing queue now picks up where you left off, regardless of which device you were listening on before. That means you can, for example, resume a playlist you were listening to on your iPad when you leave the house with just your Android phone.",

These range from overpriced resellers to outright scams, and the company warns that it “cannot guarantee any sort of protection if you purchase from non-AYN sites.” The company also notes that only emails from addresses ending in @ayn.hk are official AYN staff members.",

You wouldn’t be the only one who has this passing thought on a monthly basis. Verizon in particular tends to spark strong opinions whenever we cover it, especially as prepaid plans keep getting more competitive. After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

The N64 decomp and recomp scene has exploded in the past year, and over the weekend, the latest release was shadowdropped out of nowhere.

Banjo: Recompiled is essentially a full remaster of the original game, improving frame rates and adding widescreen support for modern displays.

Google could roll out a frosted-glass look across core UI elements, including the volume slider and power menu. Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

In his Galaxy A56 5G review , my colleague Ryan Haines found that the phone’s mediocre performance, lack of wireless charging, and limited camera capabilities hold it back considerably. But above all, one of the A56’s most significant problems is that it’s outdone by the competition.",

The listing corroborates a previous claim that the cheapest Galaxy S26 will now offer 256GB of storage instead of 128GB. This would be a long-overdue move as most of Samsung’s rivals have offered 256GB of base storage for years now. Samsung is one of the few manufacturers still offering flagship Android phones with 128GB of storage, as seen on the base Galaxy S25. However, a new retail leak has revealed some good news for the Galaxy S26. SuomiMobiili reports (h/t: SammyGuru ) that an unnamed Finnish retailer has posted color and storage details for the Samsung Galaxy S26 range . The base Galaxy S26 will apparently be available in 256GB and 512GB flavors.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority When Google started its operations in the late 1990s, it set out to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Despite continual, and sometimes secretive, iteration, the clause remains intact in its mission statement. With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages.

At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson. Speaking to Wireless Dealer Magazine at the time, Hendrickson teased a second phone before the first one had made it into customers’ hands.",

That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want.

We first previewed this update late last year, and it’s now generally available. Back in October, we got an early look at a new device setup workflow in Google Home. The revamped workflow gives you more ways to connect to third-party devices, letting you search by brand name to find both apps and devices to connect to Google’s smart home platform. Now, it looks like that update is finally rolling out. We’ve started seeing this setup process on our own devices with public-facing builds of the Google Home app. Previously, to pair a smart device with Google Home, you had to either scan a QR code on the device or hope Home could detect the presence of a device that hasn’t been configured. With this new workflow, if neither of those are an option, you can type out the name of the specific device you want to get online to initiate pairing.",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

Wonder, the gadget will pipe up every half hour or so to tell you the time, quote lines from the game, or just kind of say whatever. An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

The device will be on display at select Samsung Experience Stores, mostly located in California, New York, and Texas. The US launch date is yet to be officially announced. Whatever your opinion of a triple-panel phone, you might still be curious to check one out for yourself. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold , that doesn’t mean you have to wait for the as-yet-unannounced US release date or spend a small fortune to order one when that date comes. Samsung says the Galaxy Z TriFold will be available to experience in person across the US starting tomorrow, ahead of its official US launch. The announcement comes via Samsung’s US Newsroom , which says the device will be on display at a limited number of Experience Store locations. It’s not the launch, but it does mark the first time most US customers will be able to get hands-on with Samsung’s most experimental foldable without traveling overseas or attending an industry event.",

Intrusion logging is a new part of Android’s security tools and is now becoming available on actual devices. Earlier this month, we saw the feature in action for the first time. Now, it’s showing up on devices with Android 16, like the OnePlus Pad 3 , as spotted by our colleague AssembleDebug.

If you miss or decline a call, Take a Message can automatically spin into action, informing the caller that you’re unavailable and asking them to record a message. While it sounds like voicemail, the feature uses AI to transcribe the message and automatically store it in your Pixel’s call history, where you can revisit it later. While Take a Message was initially launched with the Pixel 10 series , Google promptly made it available on older devices as well.
