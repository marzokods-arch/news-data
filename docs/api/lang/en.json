Lee and the PHANGS-HST Team This NASA/ESA&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope &nbsp;image features a galaxy that’s hard to categorize. The galaxy in question is NGC 2775, which lies 67 million light-years away in the constellation Cancer (the Crab). NGC 2775 sports a smooth, featureless center that is devoid of gas, resembling an elliptical galaxy. It also has a dusty ring with patchy star clusters, like a spiral galaxy. Which is it: spiral or elliptical — or neither? Because we can only view NGC 2775 from one angle, it’s difficult to say for sure. Some researchers classify NGC 2775 as a spiral galaxy because of its feathery ring of stars and dust, while others classify it as a lenticular galaxy. Lenticular galaxies have features common to both spiral and elliptical galaxies. Astronomers aren’t certain of exactly how lenticular galaxies come to be, and they might form in a variety of ways. Lenticular galaxies might be spiral galaxies that merged with other galaxies, or that have mostly run out of star-forming gas and lost their prominent spiral arms. T…",

NASA/Daniel Rutter Editor’s Note: This article was updated Nov. 21, 2025 shortly after BioSentinel&#8217;s mission marked three years of operation in deep space . Astronauts live in a pretty extreme environment aboard the&nbsp; International Space Station . Orbiting about 250 miles above the Earth in the weightlessness of microgravity, they rely on&nbsp; commercial cargo missions &nbsp;about every two months to deliver new supplies and experiments. And yet, this place is relatively protected in terms of&nbsp; space radiation . The Earth’s magnetic field shields space station crew from much of the radiation that can damage the DNA in our cells and lead to serious health problems. When future astronauts set off on long journeys deeper into space, they will be venturing into more perilous radiation environments and will need substantial protection.

The one-of-a-kind aircraft flew for 67 minutes before landing and taxiing to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. NASA test pilot Nils Larson flew the X-59 up to an altitude of about 12,000 feet and an approximate top speed of 230 mph, precisely as planned. The plane’s landing gear remained down during the entire flight, a common practice for experimental aircraft flying for the first time. Now that the X-59&#8217;s first flight is in the books, the team is focused on preparing for a series of test flights where the aircraft will operate at higher altitudes and supersonic speeds.&nbsp;This test flight phase of NASA&#8217;s Quesst mission will ensure the X-59 meets performance and safety expectations. Through the Quesst mission, NASA aims to usher in a new age of quiet supersonic flight, achieved through the unique design and technology of the X-59 in future supersonic transport aircraft.
