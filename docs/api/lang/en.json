The update focuses squarely on routines, adding new starters, conditions, and actions that give you more granular control over your smart home . The changes were highlighted in a post on X by Google Home Chief Product Officer Anish Kattukaran, who stated that the update introduces approximately 20 new automation elements. Examples include dimming the lights when a TV starts playing, announcing when a washer finishes a cycle, or automatically arming a security system at a set time. According to Kattukaran, more automation “traits” are already in the pipeline, with another batch expected in the coming weeks.",

AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective.

These NAMs generally span advanced cell-tissue-organoid ( in vitro ), computational modeling ( in silico ), and cell-free biochemical analysis ( in chemico ) techniques, with each type of NAM offering different advantages. A combination and integration of multiple NAMs elements into a synergistic approach that augments gaps and/or deficiencies in individual NAMs approaches is a “combinatorial NAM” and could ultimately allow for improved predictions of human clinical response. Although many combinatorial NAMs are still early in development, not validated and standardized, nor available to the market broadly, combinatorial NAMs can potentially transform the way biomedical research, drug development, and clinical trials&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducted.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

Google built the Universal Commerce Protocol with input from major players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair, with more than 20 partners already signed on. The new “Business Agents” also let brands answer shopper questions in conversational results using their own product knowledge. Imagine asking your phone for new running shoes, and instead of just getting links, an AI finds and buys them for you, so you don’t have to switch between tabs. That future is now much closer. Google has unveiled a new open-standard framework that aims to make autonomous, AI-led shopping a real part of how we buy things online. At the center of this change is a protocol called Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP). It serves as a common language, enabling AI agents to connect with retailers, payment systems, and shopping platforms without requiring custom connections.",

Latest leak says that while the camera will have the same format, it will pack newer technologies, though details are rife at the moment. Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements.

Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer.

It’s called the Ikko MindOne, and it’s exactly the type of quirky little device I love to find at CES .",

They’ve stood for the best of the smart features and AI capabilities the smartphone world has ever seen, and have often led from the front. Compared to the AI features Pixels have been offering for years, like Magic Eraser, Apple Intelligence barely holds ground. I was mighty impressed by the Pixel 10 that launched last year, and I genuinely think it’s a better phone than even the Pro model. Yet, I still feel the Pixel 10 series just wasn’t enough. There’s only so much Google can do to improve the Pixel 10 series through software updates — and to be fair, it does quite a lot. But as we enter 2026, my hopes are firmly placed on the Pixel 11. We still have a few months before the next Pixel launches, but I want to use this time to share my wishlist with Google.",

Of course, Motorola has been fairly responsive to my concerns (and those of others) over its last few generations, so my list of persistent issues has dwindled to just one remaining. If you’ve read any of my recent reviews, you’ll know what’s coming, but here’s what Motorola needs to improve as we head into a new year.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Bixby could be getting a real AI upgrade in One UI 8.5 by handing complex questions to Perplexity AI. We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

A ducted µCooling solution for phones could move up to 0.1 cubic feet of air a minute. Heat is arguably the biggest enemy of modern processors. We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down. As a result, nearly every device we use has to make some sort of balance between performance and thermal emissions. This year at CES in Las Vegas , we’re learning about an innovative new way that xMEMS is trying to tackle that problem, giving even compact mobile devices another option for staying cool.

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands.

It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them.

    "body": "The promise of a robotic lawn mower has always been an appealing one. Set it loose in the garden to get on with the job, and reclaim a chunk of your weekend in the process. That idea has been around for years on paper, but the reality is that it has taken much longer for robot mowers to live up to that hands-off ideal. The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently. Where things have historically fallen apart is navigation. A mower that can’t reliably understand where it is or where to go will always need more babysitting than most people expect from an “autonomous” machine.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Android 16 QPR2 recently got the option to inform you when your phone’s clock automatically adjusts to a new time zone. With a future update, your Android device may also tell you the exact time your clock has moved. This will save time trying to figure out the time difference yourself. With Android 16 QPR2 , which rolled out last month, Google introduced alerts every time your phone automatically switches to a new timezone . However, the feature doesn’t tell you exactly how many hours or minutes your clocks shifted, which can make you take an extra step to look it up on Google if you’re unaware of the exact time difference or want to figure out the time where your journey originated. But Google now appears to have reconsidered and might soon fill that vacuum. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

New code strings suggest that locked app notifications will show generic “New message” or “New notification” text instead of the usual notification content. It’s unclear whether the app name and icon in the notification will also be hidden. We’re slowly and steadily marching towards the release of Android 17 , which could come with new features such as a long-awaited native App Lock solution. We already have a decent idea of how this rumored feature would work, but there were a few unknowns, one of which was how the feature would handle incoming notifications from locked apps.
