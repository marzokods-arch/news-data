For example, the weather balloon network circa 1960 only covered about 10% of the troposphere and did not extend into the Southern Hemisphere, the tropics, or over the ocean.

Google’s announced the latest wave of updates for the Google Home app. An update rolling out today brings a number of improvements to the Nest camera experience, including changes that should make your cameras better at identifying people and animals. In a help forum post, Google outlines a handful changes that are making their way to users beginning today. Thanks to changes in the Familiar Face feature, Nest cameras should be getting better at identifying individual people. Google also says its cameras will be better at distinguishing between dogs and cats at a distance. Animals should also appear with more accurate colors in low light.",

An experimental Switch-style overlay menu and improved graphics handling stand out in the update. Android, macOS, and less common devices, such as Chromebooks, now receive better or expanded support. The Eden Switch emulator has just pushed out another substantial update, though extensive as it is, this one focuses on evolution rather than revolution. Version 0.0.4 is now live, bringing performance enhancements, game fixes, and expanded device support across Android, PC , and macOS. As detailed in the GitHub changelog , there is at least one new feature of Eden v0.0.4 you’ll probably notice right away. It now has an experimental overlay menu that works a bit like the real Switch. Once enabled, holding the Home button brings it up, making it feel more natural to jump into system-style options than to back out to the main app every time.",

We previously saw that this feature was in development in July, and it’s now rolling out broadly. Google’s made it even easier to find pictures of people in the Google Photos app. Photos has always offered an optional feature called Face Groups that groups similar faces together, creating automatically updating albums of all your pictures of any given person or pet, and today, Google announced that that feature is being more directly integrated into the app’s search functions. The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet. We first caught a glimpse of this feature in an APK teardown back in July, and today, the change seems to be rolling out broadly.",

Retro game lovers have long wished to earn GameCube achievements on their playthroughs when playing on an Android flagship. The dream finally came true when the Dolphin emulator, famous for GameCube emulation, finally added GameCube support through RetroAchievements . However, this initial release was for the dev builds. Almost a month later, RetroAchievements are now available on Dolphin emulator’s stable release channel. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority The first time I got my hands on a telescopic controller, it felt like magic. Turning my phone into a Nintendo Switch made it far more fun to play, and it made me swear off touchscreen controls for good. But a few years later, the limitations of telescopic controllers are really starting to grate on me. For starters, they’re not very portable. Early models, like the first Razer Kishi, folded up into a smallish square, but newer models all have the same H-shaped design that doesn’t pack up nearly as neatly. As my bag has slowly filled up with coloring books, crayons, cards, and other things to keep my kids entertained, bag space has increasingly come at a premium. Bulky telescopic controllers didn’t make the cut.",

The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, positioning it below the recently launched OnePlus 15R. We’re unsure if the said phone is the Nord 6, the OnePlus Turbo, or any other. With the earlier-than-usual unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, followed by the less powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, we’ve already seen Android flagships lining up for global launch. Although Samsung is expected to delay its announcement of the Galaxy S26 series , OnePlus’ flagship, the OnePlus 15 , is already up for sale in global markets. The brand also recently followed up with the launch of the OnePlus 15R , much sooner than the typical launch cycle. Now, with the spare time on its hands, OnePlus is working on less premium options, and one of them is already emerging in leaks and may launch soon. Per fresh leaks, OnePlus is gearing up to launch yet another phone set for global markets. Leaker Abhishek Yadav recently posted on X that a OnePlus phone codenamed “Volkswagen” is under development.",

The move follows similar RAM-related issues affecting rivals like AYN, indicating an industry-wide problem for Android gaming handhelds. Early-bird pricing doesn’t usually disappear mid-preorder, but that’s what’s just happened with the Retroid Pocket 6. In a not-unfamiliar state of affairs for the industry, the company confirmed that it ended the RP6’s discounted pre-order pricing earlier than planned, citing a sharp increase in RAM costs. In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

Samsung is expected to launch it alongside its usual Fold, expanding its foldable lineup to three devices next year. The Wide Fold is also expected to feature 25W wireless charging. Samsung isn’t done experimenting with foldable form factors. After launching the Galaxy Z TriFold , rumor has it that the company is working on another foldable phone design, a wide one to counter Apple’s upcoming foldable iPhone. Now, a new report from South Korea’s ETNews has revealed more details about this new Samsung foldable and how it might compare to Apple’s competing device.",

I tend to dive deep into subjects with AI for short bursts that might last hours or on-and-off for a few days, and then drift away for weeks or more when life gets busy with things that are obviously more important. Slowly but surely, though, I realized I was doing less and less when it came to other personal interests. While my AI use never disrupted my real-life obligations or relationships, it was starting to cannibalize my hobbies. Recently, I started scrolling through my massive ChatGPT log entries. Some were simple entertainment, and others were deep thoughts that frankly got a bit heavy. There were more interactions than I’d ever care to count. That’s when the thought hit me: “Has this become my new doom scroll?” I started wondering how I got to that point, how much time I was wasting, and why it felt so addictive. Eventually, I took a deeper look at my AI usage patterns and then took a step back.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal.

While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

OnePlus’s R series has typically provided great options in the mid-tier/value flagship space, but the 15R breaks that trend. It removes OnePlus’s iconic alert slider for an annoying AI button, has downgraded cameras compared to the 13R, and no wireless charging — all on top of a steep $700 price tag. The OnePlus 15R isn’t the worst Android phone you can buy, but it’s also incredibly easy to find something much better — even from OnePlus itself. If you’re thinking about buying the OnePlus 15R, here are five other Android phones you should buy instead.",
