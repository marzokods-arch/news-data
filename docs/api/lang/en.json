    "body": "Amyl and The Sniffers turned a last-minute cancellation into an unforgettable night for Melbourne’s live-music community on Friday, after their free all-ages show at Federation Square was shut down minutes before they were due to take the stage. The Aussie rockers, who had been set for a triumphant hometown performance, redirected their entire AU$5,000 performance fee to seven local venues — a gesture that quickly grew into a AU$35,000 bar tab shared across some of the city’s most beloved rooms. According to ABC Australia , the gig was halted after multiple breaches of the security barrier raised concerns about crowd safety. The Melbourne Arts Precinct Corporation said the decision “wasn’t made lightly,” citing risks to the audience, staff, and the band. Fans watching the livestream were stunned as the plug was pulled just eight minutes before showtime. Rather than let the night end there, frontwoman Amy Taylor posted a video explaining the cancellation before announcing the band would give the money back to local venues that helped launch their career. “Have a drink on us,&#8221; Taylor said in the video posted to social media over the weekend, which has since clocked more than 1…",

    "body": "As some once high-flying streaming stocks limp toward the end of the year, music stocks have fallen far below their all-time high. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) dropped 11.0% to $18.93 after the company reported its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday (Nov. 11). TME reported strong growth in online music of 27.2% and music subscriptions of 17.2%. It’s not clear why investors reacted negatively, but it’s possible they have concerns that TME’s margins will suffer as offline (merchandise sales and performances) revenues grow faster than online revenues; as CFO Shirley Hu said during Tuesday&#8217;s earnings call, &#8220;offline performances and artist-related merchandise sales delivered triple-digit year-on-year revenue growth&#8221; in the quarter, adding that those offline revenues have a “lower gross margin.” Another factor was Nomura’s decision on Friday (Nov. 14) to lower its TME price target to $26 from $30 while maintaining its “buy” rating.
