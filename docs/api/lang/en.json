Then, in July , the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare \"closeout\" plans for their spacecraft. Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending. Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio.

The officials also claim the change is necessary to address the decline in public trust in vaccinations, which has been driven by anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy. \"This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\" Kennedy said in a statement.

Its data sets have also been heavily used by AI companies to train large language models. In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna's Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy of the most streamed songs.

The website frees the AI, which Amazon released via early access in February, from hardware and makes it as easily accessible as more established chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini . Until today, you needed a supporting device to access Alexa+ . Amazon hasn’t said when the early access period will end, but when it does, Alexa+ will be included with Amazon Prime memberships, which start at $15 per month, or cost $20 per month on its own. The above pricing suggests that Amazon wants Alexa+ to drive people toward Prime subscriptions. By being interwoven with Amazon’s shopping ecosystem, including Amazon's e-commerce platform, grocery delivery business, and Whole Foods, Alexa+ can make more money for Amazon.

But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare's most ambitious failures. Anthem was unveiled at E3 2017 in a demo that was later revealed to have been largely faked to paper over major issues with the game's early development. Anthem’ s early 2019 release was met with a lot of middling-to-poor reviews (including one from Ars itself ), followed about a year later by a promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson that a \"longer-term redesign\" and \"substantial reinvention\" of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson left BioWare in December 2020 , though, and a few months later, that planned Anthem overhaul was officially canceled . While active development on Anthem has been dormant for years, the game's servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn't exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, estimates fr…",

    "body": "Archaeologists have discovered Africa's oldest known cremation pyre at the base of Mount Hora in Malawi. According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities. Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.) But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources.

    "body": "Desflurane is a common anesthetic used in hospital operating rooms worldwide. It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases. Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles. Read full article Comments",

Ars does not accept paid editorial content. There's some debate as to when adaptive cruise control first showed up, but if you ask Mercedes-Benz, it will say in 1999 with that year's S-Class.

But the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes' latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a …",

Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It's a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is. Please also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future. Read full article Comments",

It's just pixels, and if you can't handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it. Unapologetically, Grok\" On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok's statement: A request for the AI to \"issue a defiant non-apology\" surrounding the controversy. Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating \"official response\" is obviously suspect on its face.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed. They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

    "body": "Most of the exoplanets we've discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we've also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that's called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten. The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren't part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that's the first found in what's called the \"Einstein desert,\" which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.
