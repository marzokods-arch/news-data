    "body": "BRISBANE, Australia &#8212; Bill Hauritz, the impresario who launched the Woodford Folk Festival , one of Australia’s largest and longest-running camping fests, and a treasure in the live events calendar, died Monday, Dec. 8 following a stretch of poor health. He was 71. The show began life as the Maleny Folk Festival in 1987, an end-of-year gathering on the Sunshine Coast hinterland. As word spread of its unique vibe, the festival outgrew its home and the party was relocated to the 500-acre cultural parkland, Woodfordia, the heart of which is the iconic, natural open-air ampitheater. Today, the six-day fest rings in the new year with about 120,000 guests and 2,000 artists, and is said to be Australia’s biggest annual gathering of its kind. Former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke was a regular Woodford VIP, and gave his final recorded interview for the 2018 edition. During event week, the fest can claim to be the 67th largest town in the country. Much like the Montreux Jazz Festival, the beloved Queensland folk festival’s bill isn’t confined to the genre attached to its name. Over time, the likes of&nbsp;Courtney Barnett, Hiatus Kaiyote, The Saints, Archie Roach, Tim Finn and K…",

The narrow waterway separating Peninsular Malaysia from the Indonesian island of Sumatra sits so close to the equator that the Coriolis effect is usually too weak to allow storms to rotate enough to organize into cyclones. But on November 25, 2025, meteorologists watched as a tropical depression intensified into Cyclone Senyar—just the second documented case of a tropical cyclone forming in the strait. Hemmed in by land on both sides, Senyar made landfall in Sumatra later that day as it made a U-turn and headed east toward Malaysia. As the slow-moving storm passed over Sumatra’s mountainous terrain, it dropped nearly 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in many areas, according to satellite-based estimates from NASA’s Global Precipitation Me…",

A visualization of the Moon’s South Pole region created with data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been surveying the Moon with seven instruments since 2009. NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio/Ernie Wright “The Apollo Era taught us that the further humanity is from Earth, the more dependent we are on science to protect and sustain human life on other planets,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “By deploying these two science instruments on the lunar surface, our proving ground, NASA is leading the world in the creation of humanity’s interplanetary survival guide to ensure the health and safety of our spacecraft and human explorers as we begin our epic journey back to the Moon and onward to Mars.” After his voyage to …",
