Google Assistant hasn’t been doing Google’s smart speakers and displays any favors in recent years, so the transition to Gemini has been long-awaited. There’s just one problem. Although Gemini for Google Home started rolling out on October 28, it looks like many Google Home users haven’t received the update yet — myself included. My Google Nest Hub has been stuck on Google Assistant, or at least it was up until a couple of days ago.",

When Google is putting in so much effort to make Android apps interoperable — from letting you play Android games on Windows to making Pixel 10s work with Apple AirDrop (you know, the existing desktop ecosystem) — isn’t this the better direction to put your energy into instead of creating a new OS from scratch?",

    "body": "TL;DR ViWoods launched the new Android 16-powered AiPaper Reader C, with a colorful E Ink display. The Reader C keeps the same compact build, data-only SIM card support, and dedicated AI button. Priced at $349, it is available now through ViWoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Complaints on Google’s support forum and Reddit indicate that the issue occurs only on Android devices. There’s no fix yet, and TeamYouTube has asked people to submit feedback. Just as the time for holiday playlists to be finalized approaches, some YouTube Music Premium listeners say their downloaded tracks have suddenly stopped working. Offline songs that played normally a few days ago are now stuck on a loading spinner, even though streaming the same tracks works without issue. PiunikaWeb spotted the growing number of complaints across Google’s support forums and Reddit. On the support forum, one Galaxy S24 Ultra user says they tried everything from clearing cache and data to rolling back to an older version, but playback still breaks the moment they download anything. Two other forum posters report the same thing, with one noting that disabling downloads entirely is the only way music will play.",

Payouts should start this spring, with affected users eligible for at least $2 via Venmo or PayPal. Payouts will mostly be automatic, but users who can’t receive automatic payments have other options. A couple of years ago, Google settled a lawsuit brought by US states that accused the company of holding an illegal monopoly on Android app distribution, using its position to overcharge users for apps and in-app purchases. Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

The X4 is available now for $69 from Xteink’s website. Chinese startup Xteink is after a spot in readers’ pockets. Today, the brand introduced its newest device, the Xteink X4, a tiny and extremely affordable e-reader designed to snap onto the back of your phone. The device lacks some premium specs but offers a unique level of portability and a fantastic price tag. The X4 weighs just 74 grams and measures 114 × 69 × 5.9mm, making it roughly the footprint of a stack of credit cards. It features a 4.3-inch E Ink display rated at 220ppi, which is softer than the 300ppi panels found on most mainstream e-readers, but the X4 is meant for quick reading breaks rather than extended binge sessions.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wstz5TElzCo When we initially reviewed the new OnePlus 15 , we found that the phone’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 was too hot to complete our usual stress test benchmarks. At the time, OnePlus stated that it was “refining the thermal curve” and has since issued an update to the handset, claiming it has addressed the problem. So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update. Flicking on the phone’s performance mode is actually closer to 5% faster in multi-core.",

Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly. This allows Pixel owners to join video calls on the console without needing to purchase or carry a separate webcam. One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

With improved app icon customization, lock screen widgets , and more, QPR2 is a darn good update. One of the more interesting changes is actually a reversal of something added in Android 16 QPR1 this past September. As part of the Material 3 Expressive interface added to Pixel phones with that update, one of the bigger UI tweaks was a blur effect in the app drawer and Quick Settings panel. I don’t mind it, but it’s something a lot of Pixel users have wanted Google to get rid of.",

Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps.

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS.
