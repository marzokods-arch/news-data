In the clip, which can be seen in full below, Irwin, dressed-up like the Prince of Darkness, tangles with Carson on a fog-filled stage before taking the action to the main floor.

The judges loved it, as Irwin and Carson collected 38 out of a possible 40 points, their best result yet in the competition which included two perfect 10s. It wasn’t enough, however, to take top spot on the night, as the pair was pipped by Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy with 39/40 .
