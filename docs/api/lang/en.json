    "body": "Donald Glover told fans at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival on Saturday night (Nov. 22) that he suffered a stroke last year while touring under his Childish Gambino moniker — an episode that ultimately led to the cancellation of his world tour. During his set at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Glover recounted the medical emergency that struck mid-tour in 2024. He explained that the symptoms began after a show in New Orleans, where he experienced a sudden, intense head pain and blurred vision. Despite performing through the discomfort, he later sought medical attention in Houston, where doctors informed him he had experienced a stroke. “I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,” he told the crowd. “I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’” He added that his first reaction was thinking he had “let everybody down,” before joking that he felt like he was “copying Jamie Foxx” — whose own stroke in 2023 made global headlines.

This means many more Android phones could soon support Quick Share-AirDrop file transfers. The chipmaker says it’ll enable support on Snapdragon devices in “the near future.” Google shocked everyone last week by quietly flipping the switch on true AirDrop support for the Pixel 10 series . But if you’re feeling left out because your Android phone can’t do the same just yet, you might be happy to hear what Qualcomm has to say. The chipmaker has now confirmed that it’s working to bring this cross-platform file sharing feature to Snapdragon-powered phones, massively widening the pool of Android devices that may soon join the Quick Share-AirDrop party.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.) But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the hi…",

It’s been a while since I’ve actually struggled to get a modern flagship to start fast charging.

We’ve seen Google pitch Google Assistant for smartwatches before, and the company even blessed Wear OS watches, old and new, with Gemini . But how many people actually use Gemini on their smartwatch? As you may have guessed, not that many. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

One thing that matters a lot to me and where I really wish AI would help is expense tracking and budgeting. There was a version of me a few years ago who did not care how often I swiped my cards or how much those random, expensive sprees were costing me. They were not all wasteful expenses, but I did not really know where exactly my money was going. After my bank balance started taking a hit, I could no longer ignore and did something I had never done before: I started tracking my expenses.",

If you have a Pixel 10 like me, now you can Quick Share with any iPhone , iPad, and Mac, or even AirDrop back from Apple devices to your Pixel. And even though it requires enabling sharing for “Everyone for 10 minutes” on both devices, it’s seamless and brilliant, and makes me wonder why we couldn’t have had this years ago. However, the unexpected news has certainly left many of us scratching our heads. We first suspected the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) had something to do with it, but since Google essentially went rogue and implemented it without Apple’s help , it seems that’s not the case. The timing is certainly “interesting,” though. Still, I have some questions and concerns about this bold Google move.",

As a Pixel 8 user, I encounter the home screen’s quirks every day, but even so, its limitations can be leveraged to build a highly functional, productivity-first home screen environment. That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters. Not everyone values this information, though, and since At a Glance is permanent, it robs these users of real estate on their home screens.",

It started in July, with the announcement that the platform would require users who didn’t seem sufficiently adult to verify they’re over the age of 18 before accessing all of what the platform has to offer. This month, yet more users got caught in YouTube’s age verification net. I’m on YouTube a lot: There aren’t many other places where I can get world news, live music performances, video game reviews, and in-depth explainers on how air conditioning works all in one spot. But YouTube’s invasive age estimation and verification practices are part of a troubling and growing trend — one that could drive me off the platform entirely.",

Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",

Interested customers can snag six months of access for just $36, paying only $5.99 per month. Apple recently raised the regular price of Apple TV to $12.99 in August, making this Black Friday deal particularly sweet. Apple TV, the rebranded streaming service formerly known as Apple TV+, seems to have another hit in the viral Pluribus series. However, it’s more expensive than ever to get started binging Apple TV titles. The streaming service hiked prices from $9.99 to $12.99 per month in August for new and existing subscribers. If you found those prices too expensive, Apple TV’s limited-time Black Friday promotion slashes the streaming service’s monthly price by more than half for six months. It’s available now for new and eligible returning subscribers, so interested customers should take advantage of it now.",
