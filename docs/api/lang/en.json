I hear the same fears we heard then — that a machine is gonna steal the soul of the art. I understand the concern. But let me be straight with you: This thing isn&#8217;t here to replace artists. It&#8217;s here to help them soar to even higher levels of artistry. Think of gen AI as the ultimate creative partner.

Unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the 200MP sensor will be used for the OPPO Find X9 Pro’s telephoto camera. The 200MP sensor should allow the OPPO to reduce the number of telephoto cameras on Find X9 Pro to one, as opposed to two on its predecessor. Android phone makers constantly engage in number games to boast improvements over previous generations and as compared to the competition. Phone cameras, with their ever-evolving megapixel counts , especially take center stage in this rivalry, as brands continually vie to outdo one another. Recently, 200MP has been the current gold standard for cameras on flagship Android phones. Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Meanwhile, Vivo has reserved a 200MP sensor for its telephoto camera, and another brand is about to follow suit.",

The experiment is part of a strategic plan to gather valuable scientific data during the Artemis II mission, enabling NASA to “know before we go” back to the lunar surface and on to Mars. The AVATAR (A Virtual Astronaut Tissue Analog Response) investigation will use organ-on-a-chip devices, or organ chips, to study the effects of deep space radiation and microgravity on human health. The chips will contain cells from Artemis II astronauts and fly side-by-side with crew on their approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. This research, combined with other studies on the health and performance of Artemis II astronauts, will give NASA insight into how to best protect astronauts as exploration expands to the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max provides more transparent marketing than most other fast chargers. The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

You all intrigued me, so I installed it on my main phone and started using it as my primary file manager. But is it any good compared to the many alternatives available?

The upgrade could enable you to not only unlock your Pixel phone using a Pixel Watch but also launch a specific section of the app. The feature is intended to work with a set of specific “Authorized” apps that you will be able to manage from the phone’s Settings. The Watch Unlock feature offers a convenient approach to automatically unlocking a Google Pixel phone — and keeping it unlocked — when your Pixel Watch is nearby. When enabled, it allows you to unlock the phone by simply swiping up or tapping a notification on the lock screen. Now, Google is testing new ways to unlock the screen and launching specific actions within certain apps on the phone.

Even me, a staunch Pixel camera fan, had somewhat given up on getting good, lively photos from my phone last year. Every time I snapped a picture, especially in a colorful environment or a warm indoor, the result came up dull and boring. I say this because I know what the Pixel’s camera was capable of in previous generations and because I’ve been testing the new Pixel 10 Pro XL against the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The results? They’re not even funny. Nearly everything I complained about with the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera has been fixed on the 10 Pro, which makes me equally happy and angry. See for yourself.",

In fact, I’d say that Nova Launcher has been the go-to app for Android customization for well over a decade. It earned that well-deserved status by giving users more control than stock launchers ever could, from how icons looked to how gestures worked to how the app drawer was laid out. But all good things come to an end, and the development of the app has drawn to a close. Anyone following the industry would’ve seen the writing on the wall when the app got taken over by Branch Metrics a while back. All that to say that updates and future compatibility remain unlikely. And if you haven’t been keeping up with alternate launchers for a while now — I know I haven’t — well, it’s time to start planning for what comes next. The good news is that Android’s launcher scene has grown rich and varied, and I’ve spent time testing and revisiting a wide range of options that will appeal to you not only if you’re looking for a Nova alternative, but also if you want to try something fresh. These are seven of my favorite Nova Launcher alternatives that stand out right now.",

Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process.

Google has a fair few things in the pipeline for Google Home. Gemini is coming to Google Home in October, and a new Gemini-powered Nest speaker , new Nest doorbells, and Nest cameras are in the works. Google is even previewing controls for more smart devices in the Home web app. However, not all is well with the platform and Google’s latest phones, as Pixel 10 users have complained about missing Google Home notifications on their devices. Thankfully, Google has confirmed it’s working on a solution. Reddit user GreyFoxSolid said they weren’t receiving Google Home notifications on their new Pixel 10 Pro XL.

Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others.

Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users. Google has been working to fix that by directly opening up the ability to search for photos from albums shared with you on Google Photos.

The MatePad Pro and the MatePad 11.5 are two new tablets catering to power users and general consumers. So, should you buy them? And which one should you choose? Here are my thoughts. HUAWEI MatePad Pro 12.2 (2025) The HUAWEI MatePad Pro 2025 could almost be my favorite tablet without a few issues. First, let’s go through the specs because they are impressive. It has a 12.2-inch OLED display, and this is one of the best tablets I own for watching content. It offers 2,000 nits of peak brightness and features HUAWEI’s excellent sound tuning. This is probably one of the best-sounding tablets I’ve used in a long time. The tablet’s body is incredibly thin, making it ideal for traveling.",

The editor supports conditions, adds new actions and triggers, and just empowers more complicated automations. While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand.

Google adds that packages set to arrive within 24 hours will continue to show up at the top of your inbox, and summary cards will still be there. This update simply adds a new view that aims to organize all of your purchase and delivery updates into a list, so you can find what you’re looking for quickly.",

Now regulatory filings suggest that Samsung will keep the Ultra at 45W again. For a whole lot of smartphone shoppers, power is the name of the game. And we’re not talking performance, either, like how high you can get those benchmark figures, but electrical power: how much charge your phone holds, and how quick and easy it is to get it recharged. Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles .

Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish. Relying on an earbud to collect your data is like asking a toddler to take your photo; you’ll get something, but it will probably be blurry, crooked, or missing half your head.
