The gesture came during the band’s signature “doodle” segment — the stripped-back interlude led by guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo — which has become a staple of the current tour. The pair launched into an instrumental version of AC/DC’s “For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)” before shifting into Rose Tattoo’s “Nice Boys Don’t Play Rock ’n’ Roll,” drawing loud approval from the sold-out crowd. The moment carried added resonance as AC/DC were performing their own Power Up tour the same night in Melbourne, creating a rare split-city convergence of two generations of rock royalty. The Sydney show capped a five-city Australian run in which Metallica incorporated local tributes at every stop. In Perth on Nov. 1, Hammett and Trujillo performed John Butler Trio’s “Zebra.” Adelaide received a rendition of The Angels’ “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again,” while Melbourne fans heard a nod to The Living End’s “Prisoner of Society” with hints o…",

The dispute, which escalated over the weekend, comes months after the death of her husband , founding Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne. Simpson, who managed the group in their earliest days, announced on Nov. 14 that he intends to release a collection of 1969 demos recorded before the band adopted the Black Sabbath name. The material, titled Earth: The Legendary Lost Tapes , was initially expected for release in July. The project has yet to materialize, but Simpson maintains he has the right to distribute the recordings. Sharon publicly disputed those claims in a detailed Instagram post shared on Saturday (Nov. 15). Her post included screenshots of a July 2 email she says she sent to Simpson, warning him against moving forward without the band’s approval. “As you know, the Band do not want these tapes released, not least as they haven’t heard them despite you saying you would provide copies long ago,” she wrote. “You know that, as a band, Black Sabbath don’t take…",

One of the surprises this year was the performance by veteran band 4 Non Blondes, who won over both old and new fans following the viral trend of the Nicki Minaj mash-up &#8220;Beez in the Trap&#8221; fused with &#8220;What’s Up?&#8221; The new song has been used in hundreds of thous…",
