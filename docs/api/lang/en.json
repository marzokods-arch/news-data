Most of us would probably answer no to that question, and yet that’s exactly what companies like OpenAI and Perplexity are asking us to do with their new AI browsers, Atlas and Comet . OpenAI’s Atlas is a new browser with ChatGPT built-in, and it goes much further than Google’s addition of Gemini to Chrome. Atlas has agentic capabilities meaning the AI can surf the internet on your behalf by opening tabs, navigating to specific websites, clicking on buttons, and even filling in text fields. If that sounds like a potential game-changer, I’d like to temper that excitement because it’s also a big security gamble. Here’s why I’m not switching to Atlas in a hurry.",

Despite previous reports of a launch in the US, Samsung may choose not to launch it beyond the “Greater China” region. 2025 appears to be the year of new products from Samsung. After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Thankfully, we know that Google is working to improve Android’s multitasking capabilities. The company is making big changes to the platform in preparation for Android-powered PCs , and these changes will benefit not only future Android PCs but also existing Android tablets.

This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through.

Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line.

Speeds are capped at 25Mbps and aimed at rural users who previously relied on DSL or satellite connections. It seems every cellular carrier is pushing home internet hard these days. Even Mint Mobile recently announced plans for its own low-cost home internet service starting at just $30 a month when prepaid annually. Not one to be one-up in pricing in seems, Verizon has now announced a more competitive Lite plan that starts at just $25 a month. Unlike Mint, you don’t have to pay annually for this rate either.

An Infoblox report states that it behaves like malware, with keylogging features and disabled security tools. The browser has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, with ties to illegal gambling sites. A web browser claiming to keep your data safe may be doing exactly the opposite. According to a new investigation, an app called Universe Browser, which has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, surreptitiously installs dangerous software and routes your internet traffic through servers in China. The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The researchers say the ‘privacy browser’ behaves a lot like malware, with features that resemble keylogging, secret connections to external servers, and background activity that alters device settings. It even blocks features like right-click menus and developer tools, and disables key browser security protections.",

Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations.

For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",
