One of Android’s biggest selling points has always been its flexibility. Maybe there’s a downside to that, though, as we start feeling a bit indignant when there’s something we can’t change in the way we’d like.

Between March 7 and Jun. 16, 2025, NASA worked with crowdsourcing company Freelancer to seek design ideas from global creators for a zero gravity indicator that will fly aboard the agency’s Artemis II test flight. Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space. Artemis II marks the first time that the public has had a hand in creating a crew’s mascot. The Mission Over…",

It’s a system-level component, meaning it can’t be uninstalled without root access and can only be toggled off. Even when disabled, the system reportedly attempts to restart Lock Glimpse every few seconds, resulting in unnecessary background activity. Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience. You wake your phone and see rotating images paired with short headlines, each linking out to a web article. The pitch is that it adds variety and context. The reality, according to many users , is that it feels a lot like ads wearing a minimalist disguise.",

Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage.

    "body": "Credit: Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority The Galaxy S26 series isn’t even official yet, but the mood around Samsung’s next flagship launch already feels unusually flat. New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",

My love for all things E-Ink is well documented, and for years I’ve wanted a device that can combine the benefits of E-Ink with the versatility of a full-fledged tablet . I want a single device that can swap out my paperback, take notes as responsively as an old-school notepad, and handle a modern digital workflow without breaking a sweat. It sounds simple enough. We’ve had E-Ink readers for years, and we have had tablets for even longer. The logical endpoint, the holy grail, would be a fast and fluid color E-Ink reader. Imagine a screen that can render comic books in full color, handle highlighting for PDFs, and manage color-coded calendars, all while giving me the benefits of all-out sunlight readability and battery life. Sounds perfect to me. I’ve spent years chasing a device that can merge the magic of E-Ink with the flexibility of a real tablet. On paper, the Boox Note Air 5C is exactly that device. It’s certainly not the first color E-Ink tablet on the market, but it does strike an effective balance of hardware, software, and support to seemingly bridge the gap between a Kindle and an iPad.

In a new beta, the app is working on adding support for satellite and terrain imagery, as well. With all three views, you’ll also be able to toggle on traffic density data. Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",
