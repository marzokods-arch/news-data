NCT members were meant to rotate through various configurations under the banner of ‘NCT U,’ emphasizing flexibility over permanence. While the concept made waves, it ultimately settled into a more traditional unit-based structure — an ambitious experiment that achieved only partial success.

As a part of the label’s strategy, the act’s members are introduced one by one rather than being revealed all at once, and fans actively participate in shaping unit combinations through voting. All of this interaction takes place on COSMO, the company’s proprietary fan platform — distinct from HYBE’s Weverse or paid messaging services like Bubble — designed specifically to support MODHAUS’ participatory system.

It’s the beginning of the new year, which means you and many others may be on a fitness kick right now. Mobile apps, like Fitbit and Nike Training Club, can help you achieve your fitness goals, and there are plenty to choose from.

Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others.

The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different.

According to a post by leaker Roland Quandt, Google’s next midrange smartphone should be “in retail” in just a few weeks, starting in February. In a post on Bluesky, Quandt says that the Pixel 10a will be released in four colorways and two storage configurations “around mid Feb.” It’s been rumored before that the 10a would launch earlier than Google typically releases its A series phones, but this is the first time we’ve heard February, specifically.",

The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

This app modifies the official YouTube app to give users a variety of extra features. That got us wondering how many people prefer alternatives to the official app. We posed this question last week, and here’s how you answered it.",

Unfortunately, Redditor Competitive-Split584 recently outlined their horrible Google Pixel customer support experience. The user claimed that their Pixel 8 Pro developed a hardware fault related to Wi-Fi, so they contacted customer support. Google’s own system apparently showed that the device was still under warranty. The user was apparently promised an “advanced exchange,” but the ordeal is still ongoing after four weeks and 22 different customer support representatives.

After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively.

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR After intense criticism from fans, AYANEO has outlined a “Service Improvement Plan” for 2026. It addresses shipping delays, poor customer service, quality control, and more. The company has also delayed the Pocket Play campaign while it works to implement the changes. AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott. After a poorly received initial response , AYANEO’s CEO stepped in to provide a full statement and “ Service Improvement Plan ” to turn things around in 2026.",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple finished 2025 as the world’s top smartphone brand in terms of units shipped, extending its lead over Samsung thanks to faster year-on-year growth. Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

Google built the Universal Commerce Protocol with input from major players like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair, with more than 20 partners already signed on. The new “Business Agents” also let brands answer shopper questions in conversational results using their own product knowledge. Imagine asking your phone for new running shoes, and instead of just getting links, an AI finds and buys them for you, so you don’t have to switch between tabs. That future is now much closer. Google has unveiled a new open-standard framework that aims to make autonomous, AI-led shopping a real part of how we buy things online. At the center of this change is a protocol called Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP). It serves as a common language, enabling AI agents to connect with retailers, payment systems, and shopping platforms without requiring custom connections.",

Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S26 series soon, most likely in the last week of February. But even with weeks remaining for one of Samsung’s biggest unveilings of the year, leaks and rumors about Samsung’s next generation of flagships are already gushing in. While Samsung has slept on upgrading the hardware, specifically the camera, over the last few generations of its Galaxy S series phones, the Galaxy S27 Ultra may finally bring some improvements. Last week, we leaned into the possibilities of these upgrades, suggesting that three of the four rear cameras on the Galaxy S27 Ultra could be upgraded to newer sensors . And today, we’re learning a bit more about the primary camera sensor.

Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer.

An update to Android Auto is expected to roll out soon, but it’s not obvious that update will solve this problem. Android Auto seems to be acting up for some users. 9to5Google spotted today that multiple users have reported they’re unable to reply to messages from their in-car displays, but the issue seems to be contained to a relatively small group of users. Apparently a recent bug is causing in-car Android Auto displays to throw up an error message when some users attempt to reply to messages, telling them that they need to ask their Google Workspace administrator for permission.",

The company has acknowledged the issue and says it is working on a fix. Uploading a video to YouTube isn’t exactly a quick process, but it doesn’t usually take very long either. You can usually finish an upload within the time it takes you to fill out the video details. However, users have recently been running into an issue that’s delaying the upload process.
