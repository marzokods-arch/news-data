The Puerto Rican superstar urged them to &#8220;set the bar high&#8221; for the remaining seven nights at the iconic venue. &#8220;You are the last city I’ll visit this year, and that wasn’t by chance, it was planned. We have to close the year in Mexico!&#8221; the singer shouted excitedly, unleashing the roar of the 65,000 people (according to promoter Ocesa) who packed the stadium. &#8220;And I know you guys won’t disappoint. First night out of eight, you have to set the bar high for the following nights.&#8221; His local fans — along with many others from 77 countries, per Ocesa — didn’t let him down during the over two-hour show, dancing and singing along to his setlist , which included the hard-hitting reggaetón track &#8220;Chambea,&#8221; added exclusively for Mexico, he said.

Chalamet has long been a fan of hip-hop and he even rapped under the alias of Lil&#8217; Timmy while growing up. EsDeeKid hides his identity with a balaclava, and the silence by Chalamet and EsDeeKid allowed speculation to set social media ablaze.

The spokesperson states that an optimization was identified and that the rollout across all devices is “progressing as planned.” Nothing OS 4.0 began rolling out to the Phone 3 on November 21 and days later to the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Plus, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro. Despite the rollout starting last month, many Nothing Phone owners claim that they have yet to receive the Android 16 skin. After a screenshot of an exchange with Nothing’s support team was shared online, it was believed that the update had been pulled . Now Nothing has offered an official statement on the status of the rollout. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A selection of Sora-generated video content is coming to the Disney+ app. The deal will see Disney purchase equity in OpenAI, making it part owner. Disney has been pretty litigious when it comes to AI platforms appropriating its intellectual property. In June, the company sued AI image generator Midjourney , seeking to stop the platform from creating images using characters from its IPs. Then, in September, it sent a cease-and-desist to AI chatbot provider Character.AI, again citing the platform’s unauthorized use of its characters. But now, ChatGPT developer OpenAI has announced that its products will soon be able to create images and videos of all your favorite Disney characters — with Disney’s blessing. OpenAI detailed the arrangement in a blog post this morning. Disney and OpenAI are partnering up to allow both ChatGPT Images and Sora to generate content containing characters, props, locations, and more from Disney’s vast IP empire, which includes Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, beginning early next year.",

    "body": "5 min read NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Spies Solar Wind ‘U-Turn’ Images captured by NASA’s Parker Solar Probe as the spacecraft made its record-breaking closest approach to the Sun in December 2024 have now revealed new details about how solar magnetic fields responsible for space weather escape from the Sun — and how sometimes they don’t. Like a toddler, our Sun occasionally has disruptive outbursts. But instead of throwing a fit, the Sun spews magnetized material and hazardous high-energy particles that drive space weather as they travel across the solar system. These outbursts can impact our daily lives, from disrupting technologies like GPS to triggering power outages, and they can also imperil voyaging astronauts and spacecraft. Understanding how these solar outbursts, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), occur and where they are headed is essential to predicting and preparing for their impacts at Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Images taken by Parker Solar Probe in December 2024, and published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters , have revealed that not all magnetic material in a CME escapes the Sun — some makes it back, changing the shape of the solar atmosphere in subt…",

    "summary": "Like other foldables, the Galaxy Z TriFold lets you transition apps from the cover to the main screen, but there’s a catch.",
    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung quietly listed a new 60W charger, hinting at big charging changes ahead. The new adapter upgrades to USB PD 3.1 with PPS for more flexible power delivery up to 60W. It adjusts voltage from 5V to 20V at 3A and doesn’t require a 5A cable. Samsung is apparently making changes to its charging lineup with Super Fast Charging 3.0 , and the first official sign isn’t a big announcement from the company but a simple accessory listing. A new 60W power adapter has appeared on Samsung’s website , as spotted by Abhishek Yadav on X . The company hasn’t formally announced the charger yet, but the timing suggests it’s preparing for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to move past Samsung’s 45W charging limit .",

At an event in San Jose, California, Google gave my colleague C. Scott Brown a preview of the different styles of XR glasses it is working on. Unlike the Galaxy XR, which is also powered by Google’s specialized software, these glasses serve only part of the purpose, but also at a fraction of the cost and with much less burden on your skull.",

It remains unclear whether the Gemini experience will run within the app or redirect users externally to the Gemini app. Gemini started off slow, but Google has made great progress in making the AI digital assistant actually useful. The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

Samsung appears so confident of its effects that it also wants to sell it to clients such as Qualcomm. If that works out, we might see it being used on the rumored special version of Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Samsung’s Exynos chipsets have been relentlessly criticized and trolled for their heating issues. The poor heat management on Exynos chips has also contributed to throttling and their inability to sustain high performance for long enough, which has traditionally made them less desirable than Snapdragon-branded counterparts. But Samsung has refused to abandon that ship, and might have actually addressed it with the upcoming Exynos 2600, which could power some of the Galaxy S26 models in certain regions. Not just Samsung appears so confident in its solution that it’s ready to offer it to other companies, including Apple and Qualcomm. According to a recent report by the Korean outlet ET News , Samsung has formally announced its technology to address heat-related throttling issues on chipsets.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s new One UI 8.5 interface brings an improved video recording menu. The feature now lets you record only a portion of the screen, rather than the entire screen. However, it’s currently slightly challenging to work with, especially if you use swipe gestures for navigation, and we hope Samsung fixes it. After months of leaks, Samsung’s next big update, One UI 8.5, is finally ready for beta testing. And it brings a highly modified interface that could spark opinions about drawing inspiration from Apple’s iOS 26 . But in addition to the renewed system UI and apps, One UI 8.5 is also bringing improvements to key functionalities, and one of them is how screen recording works. With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

    "body": "TL;DR Motorola foldable phones to date have all been of the vertical-opening “clamshell” variety. In a holiday gift pack, the company teases its CES event with a notebook featuring “fold” language. A notecard further teases “new perspectives,” which could hint at a horizontally oriented foldable. Foldable smartphones may all rely on the same basic flexible-display trick, but how manufacturers go about designing them still varies wildly — and things are only getting more complicated as we move further into the dual-fold era with devices like the (incredibly poorly named) Galaxy Z TriFold . So far, Motorola has only produced foldables of the same vertically unfolding variety, but a potential teaser might just hint at a new direction — literally.

The RAM on the Homey Pro has been updated from 2GB to 4GB, now allowing it to run even more apps and workflows. The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade.

This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools.

Evidence found in the Google app shows a pop-up warning about “discarding conversation” when changing settings. The feature mirrors a recent YouTube experiment but is currently incomplete, with no input box actually available yet. YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next. The twist, though, is that this ability is facilitated through an AI chatbot that users must interact with by entering prompts. While it’s unclear whether YouTube will graduate this experiment into a permanent feature, it seems Google may be looking to bring this AI chatbot-powered custom feed to Discover as well.

It’s not like a camera or a fingerprint reader, where you instantly know why it’s part of your device. It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

When you click edit, you’ll have two options: Edit with Google Photos or download the RAW file. Choosing to edit with Photos will convert the photo into a JPEG. RAW not only allows you to capture the highest quality photos, but the format also gives you greater editing flexibility. However, these benefits come at a cost, and that cost is space. RAW images have an enormous file size compared to JPEGs, and not every photo editor can handle them, including Google Photos.

The Index 01 records voice notes on a paired smartphone, and can also do things like set reminders and control music playback. The new ring is available for pre-order today for $75. Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",
