    "body": "One of my favorite web browser trends in recent years has been vertical tabs. Moving your tabs from the top of your browser to the side may not sound like a significant change on paper, but in practice, it makes your browser look so much cleaner and better organized. While many browsers — such as Edge, Firefox, Arc, and Vivaldi — support vertical tabs, Google Chrome has long been missing from the vertical tab bandwagon. But at long last, that’s finally changing; vertical tabs have arrived in Chrome !",

Yes, there was the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 3x 50MP camera, and a great screen. But the phone got extremely hot under heavy load, the 8MP ultrawide shooter was disappointing, and the lack of wireless charging was notable for the €1,000 recommended price. If anything, the OnePlus 13 shone a harsh light on the GT7 Pro. Between its versatile cameras, impressive performance, great screen, and premium extras, it was clear that OnePlus had the more well-rounded package. Now, realme is back with the realme GT8 Pro. And it turns out the new phone has a lot in common with the OnePlus 15 . In fact, this seems like the OnePlus 15 from a parallel universe.",

I knew they would cost me more in the long run , but at the time, I had few other affordable options. By late last year, I had fully paid off all but one device on our account. I was seriously considering paying the remaining balance in one lump sum and switching to prepaid. I was confident that I would be out from under Verizon ahead of 2026. Then things changed, and now I am no longer certain I will leave Verizon anytime soon.",

According to Fat Mike, the documentary does not shy away from the most extreme, uncomfortable or self-destructive chapters of the group’s history. “Most people wouldn’t be OK with releasing a film that shows footage of getting whipped in their dungeon, or their drug use for the past 20 years, or dressing up like a rubber cheap whore, or the ambulance ride when they were naked while puking and shitting blood… I’m not like most people,” Fat Mike said. Directed by James Buddy Day, 40 Years of F**kin’ Up traces NOFX’s evolution from teenage punks to one of the most influential and polarising bands in modern punk history. The documentary features extensive interviews with the band’s core lineup — guitarist Eric Melvin, lead guitarist El Hefe and drummer Erik Sandin — all of whom also serve as executive producer…",

As a writer, she has penned everything from poignant, detailed ballads about life in the Great Smoky Mountains, where she grew up, to some of the most defining love songs of all time.

The record is crafted to be consumed from start to finish, with the narrations advancing the plot and the songs bringing a range of emotional highs and lows. Still, for the purpose of this review, we&#8217;ll stick to reviewing each track from the English version of the album on its own individual merit.

Facer’s also got a new Fallout-themed Pip-Boy 3.0 watch face, complete with Face Chime sounds. At CES last week, smartwatch face platform Facer announced, among other things, a new feature it calls Face Chime , which lets watch face makers add custom chime sounds that play at the top of the hour to their faces. That feature is now available on Facer watch faces on Wear OS 6. Face Chime sounds are applied to watch faces by their creators, so only faces with sounds added support the feature — this update won’t let you add hourly chime sounds to watch faces on your own. Facer says there’ll be thousands of watch faces on its platform updated with Face Chime sounds over the next few weeks, though as of writing, it only highlights a couple dozen compatible faces.",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually Google backed down, and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Changes are coming to how Android users install apps outside the safety and protection of the Play Store. Google sounded the alarm last summer, warning the Android community that starting in 2026, even developers releasing apps for sideloading would have to register with Google . Following some immediate pushback, Google softened its stance a bit, ultimately agreeing to give informed users the option for an “advanced” installation flow that would support even unverified apps. And as we wait to see exactly how that’s going to work, we’re starting to spot some early pieces of it.

One streaming exec says only about 10% of Android users still cast content. Casting still matters to some people, but Netflix no longer seems to see it as essential. Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",

Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch.

Now, the channel has tested a new mid-range phone that puts some flagship phones to shame. JerryRigEverything tested the newly launched Xiaomi Redmi Note 15 Pro Plus, which has a recommended price of €499.99 (~$581) in Europe, and came away suitably impressed.",

The feature will also automatically lock the connected Android device when it’s left behind. The Apple Watch has a nifty feature that notifies you if your iPhone or iPad gets left behind. Besides reminding you not to forget it while stepping out of the house, the feature can also instantly alert you if your iPhone gets stolen. The Galaxy Watch also offers similar functionality to let you know when you leave your Galaxy phone behind.

While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Apple is working on end-to-end encryption for RCS in iOS 26.3 Beta 2. The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus is set to enter mass production later this month, as per industry sources. With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

With AutoPay, three lines cost $140/month before taxes, or about $46 per line. You get 250GB of high-speed mobile hotspot data, and the plan includes 30GB of high-speed data usable in Canada, Mexico, and over 215 international destinations. In a bold move aimed squarely at poaching customers from Verizon and AT&amp;T, T-Mobile has launched its new Better Value Plan , offering strong benefits for people who use a lot of data and those who travel internationally. The main difference is not just a lower monthly price. T-Mobile wants customers to get valuable features without paying for the highest tier.

Google’s Android team spent a significant chunk of 2025 overhauling various system apps with the more modern Material 3 Expressive UI. One of the apps that received a refresh was Google Clock , which introduced extensive changes, including prominent fonts, larger buttons, and more vibrant background colors. But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon is launching its Fig colorway for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft on January 28, 2026. The new finish applies to the front-lit Colorsoft model, available in 32GB and 64GB configurations. This is a design update only, with no changes to hardware, specs, or features. Good news for anyone who wants a Kindle Scribe Colorsoft that’s a little more colorful. Amazon’s largest note-taking e-reader will soon be available in Fig, a warm berry-toned color that lands somewhere between plum and deep cranberry. It’s a fairly refined colorway that offers a little more personality than the standard Graphite without being overly bold. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft first debuted in the US on December 10, 2025, introducing Amazon’s latest generation of the Scribe lineup with an 11-inch color E Ink display, adjustable front light, and improved performance. Since launch, the Colorsoft model has been available in a single utilitarian gray (Graphite) from Amazon and major retailers.",

Google Search data is paramount in determining what topics, people, and questions users find important . Google hosts a tool called Google Trends that anyone can use to discover the search queries and topics that are currently trending.

Google announced today, January 14, that it is redesigning the Trends Explore page — and the new look adds a Gemini sidebar for the first time.

As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding.
