Five years later, she sounded preternaturally mature when Curb Records released her first single, “Blue,” which garnered comparisons to Patsy Cline.

A Google support page confirms the feature is only available on the Pixel 8 Pro and newer, leaving out owners of older UWB-equipped Pixels. The exact technical reason for this incompatibility is unclear, as the hardware specifications for the older models don’t fully explain the omission. Choosing the right Bluetooth tracker can be challenging, but if you want to take advantage of your Android phone’s UWB hardware for precision finding, the choice is simple: the Moto Tag. It’s currently the only UWB-equipped tracker that works with Android, allowing you to precisely pinpoint its location from the Find Hub app. However, since most Android phones lack UWB, very few devices can use the Moto Tag’s best feature. The technology is only available on select devices in Motorola’s Edge and Razr lines, Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S and Z series, and Google’s Pixel phones.",

Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the SoC of choice for many next-generation Android flagships . It’s the latest and greatest chip on the block, announced just a few weeks ago. The cycle for new phones has just gotten started with this new SoC, but we’re already seeing leaks appear for its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6.

We did that for a bit the first year or two, then fell into a rhythm of choosing what we wanted together, be it valuable purchases, trips, or experiences. But a few months ago, as his birthday was approaching, I decided to break this unspoken rule and buy him an Android gaming handheld, the Retroid Pocket Classic (). Here’s why I made that choice and why it turned out to be the most perfect and fun gift I could’ve ever given him. Why a portable gaming device seemed like the perfect gift",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR A missing font was causing the Pixel Camera app to crash on de-Google’ed operating systems, such as GrapheneOS. Users had to downgrade to an older release of the camera app to use it again. To fix the issue, users on GrapheneOS build v2025102300 and older can install the GmsCompatLib app v100 from the GrapheneOS store. A future GrapheneOS build (v2025102600) will include the Pixel Camera app fix natively, eliminating the need for extra installation. Last week, the Pixel Camera app began crashing on de-Googled aftermarket OS solutions, such as GrapheneOS. If users didn’t have Google Play Services on their device, the Pixel Camera app would either crash or refuse to start. As it turns out, the actual issue was a missing font . Users could roll back to older versions of the Pixel Camera app, but now, the fix is here for GrapheneOS users. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Compared to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest headsets, Galaxy XR figures to handle wired accessories better thanks to the dedicated port. Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working on a new user interface for Messages that’ll swap the hamburger menu for a context menu. The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

Google’s also beginning to remove references from Assistant within the app. Going forward, we may see a new “pulsing” effect for the time. These past few months have been busy ones for many of Google’s Android apps, as the company has been sprucing up their looks with a fresh touch of Material 3 Expressive . While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases. The good news is that Google is learning from your feedback, and already appears to be correcting just such an oversight.

    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority TL;DR Google Home users report their cameras describing fictional people. One summary said “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” while another labeled a man living alone as “Sarah.” If the reports are accurate, a likely possibility is that Gemini on Google Home is hallucinating, rather than intruders or data mix-ups. With Halloween week upon us, it probably isn’t the best time for your smart home to start suggesting that people you aren’t familiar with have been wandering your property. However, a couple of Reddit users claim their Google Home devices have started describing people they don’t know. According to a post on the r/googlehome subreddit , a user’s Nest camera described an activity summary saying “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” even though no one by that name lives there. When the user asked about it, Google’s assistant reportedly replied that its camera “can identify faces even if you haven’t explicitly named them,” and that it had spotted “Michael” between October 26 and 27. The user said they’d never entered that name into the system, but the actions described were what he himself had done. He found the response …",

While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

Atlas has agentic capabilities meaning the AI can surf the internet on your behalf by opening tabs, navigating to specific websites, clicking on buttons, and even filling in text fields. If that sounds like a potential game-changer, I’d like to temper that excitement because it’s also a big security gamble. Here’s why I’m not switching to Atlas in a hurry.",

I stopped using the Pixel Tablet in December 2023, and for all of 2024 and most of 2025, it was boxed up and stored in my parents’ basement. But about a month ago, I decided to dig out the Pixel Tablet and put it back in my apartment. And … I kind of love it.",

The phone may be initially limited to Asian markets — particularly South Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. Despite previous reports of a launch in the US, Samsung may choose not to launch it beyond the “Greater China” region. 2025 appears to be the year of new products from Samsung. After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR The ARMSX2 emulator for Android has just received its V1.0 release on GitHub, with a Play Store release coming later this week. The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Considering some kids are less great with phones than others, I really didn’t want to spend much here at all. That’s when I decided to try another path: buying a prepaid phone at a discount.",

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.
