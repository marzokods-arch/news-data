The Redmi K90 Pro Max is set to launch in China tomorrow. It’s hard to get excited about Android flagships these days when all phones look the same and the specs barely change over a generation or four. Every once in a while, Android OEMs will experiment with the CMF of their phones, giving us something unique to get excited about. We’ve seen Redmi tease and confirm a denim-like texture on the back panel of the upcoming Redmi K90 Pro Max . Now, the company has confirmed that the flagship also comes with a woofer on the back.

Several users report that their phones have changed from orange to a rose gold hue, possibly due to solvent use or UV exposure. Apple has quietly replaced affected units. Official response is still pending. The iPhone 17 series is one of Apple’s most successful releases in recent times. Despite the phones being available for over a month now, many models are still routinely out of stock, indicating continued strong demand. Case in point, the new Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max still has a shipping wait time of one to three weeks, depending on the storage variant. The saturated orange color is catching the fancy of many users, but if you have one or are considering buying, you should be aware of the possibility that it may turn rose gold, potentially by accident.

Apple announced plans for an image generator, photo editing tools, the ability to write and rewrite messages, and more, and it was all coming… eventually. Well, now it’s been here for about a year, and I’ve been using it nearly the entire time.

Google lets you add your credit and debit cards, which can be used for quick contactless payments, but the process to add them takes a few steps. Thankfully, that is being fixed now with the latest update. Google Wallet is simplifying the mechanism for adding new debit or credit cards to your collection.

Thousands gathered in several Australian capital cities last Sunday, Oct. 19 for the “March for Australia” rallies, which formed as a collective voice against the federal government’s immigration policies, and for counter protests. Williamson, not for the first time, has called out the unauthorized use of his music. Turning to Facebook , Williamson writes: “‘True Blue’ is a song for all Australians and should not be hijacked by any group that seeks to use the song to sow division. I believe in a multicultural society &#8211; one where all Australians come together in unity to celebrate our unique multicultural nature and freedoms.” A decade ago, the ARIA Hall of Famer put conservative event organizers on blast for attempting to weaponize his famous song. Back in 2015, he shared a post on Facebook in which he noted that “True Blue” was reportedly being used at rallies by various groups including the Reclaim Australia movement, and “did not have my approval to use it.” On that occasion, he wrote,…",

Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way.",

At the cost of some battery life, your phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance. While most Android phones have an AOD, it doesn’t behave the same way on every device. Some phones let you schedule the AOD to benefit from its glanceable information without unnecessarily draining the battery. Pixel phones , however, offer no such controls — the AOD is either on or off during the day.

The latest Android Canary release introduces a new visual design for this slider that resembles an actual flashlight. This feature is not expected to launch in a stable release until the Android 16 QPR3 update next March. Most Android phones have rear LEDs that can be used as a flashlight, but not all of them let you natively control the brightness. On Pixel phones , for instance, adjusting the flashlight brightness requires a third-party app. This is a hassle, and many users aren’t even aware such apps exist, leaving them unable to change their flashlight’s intensity. A future Android release will finally let you adjust your Pixel phone’s flashlight strength from Quick Settings . Instead of a simple toggle, the Flashlight tile is being updated to be expandable, revealing a slider to control the flashlight’s intensity. While this slider had a barebones design in the 2508 Android Canary release , Google is now giving it a more striking visual update.",

An agentic mode is available in preview for Plus, Pro, and Business users. As entrepreneurs seek to find a home for AI in every nook and cranny of our lives, one area we’ve seen receiving concerted attention has been our web browsers. While we’ve long been able to access advanced AI chatbot through their web portals, this new effort seeks to bring AI processing power right to the browser itself, opening up new use cases. Maybe that means AI agents being able to interact with remote websites just as if we were doing so ourselves, or concisely breaking down complicated pages and summarizing them for us . Now one of the biggest names in the industry is taking its own stab at just this kind of project. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Palma 2 Pro adds 5G in a pocket-sized design. After launching the P6 Pro series in China earlier this month, BOOX has now brought its high-end counterpart to a global audience. The new Palma 2 Pro brings the same blend of color E Ink and 5G connectivity to the US and Europe, launching alongside the larger Note Air5 C tablet. Both devices run Android 15 and continue BOOX’s effort to combine the comfort of paper with the flexibility of a smart device. We got an early look at the Palma 2 Pro during IFA 2025 in Berlin , where it already hinted at many of the same upgrades seen in the P6 Pro. The 6.13-inch handheld swaps the usual black-and-white E Ink display for a Kaleido 3 color panel, which delivers 300 ppi for monochrome content and 150 ppi for color. It also features 5G support via a hybrid SIM and microSD slot, marking a first for the Palma lineup. Powered by Android 15 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, it keeps the textured, water-repellent design that made the earlier Palma 2 such a hit.",

Other subscriptions have come and gone in that time, but not YouTube; it’s the one monthly payment I gladly make because I know it supports creators I like and saves me hours of frustration with endless ads on every device my husband and I own. But YouTube Premium isn’t perfect. Every few months, I’ll hear about a new experiment or new feature exclusive to Premium users , and think, “Gah, this isn’t what I want!” If it were up to me, YouTube would add more robust controls and customizations and offer them to Premium subscribers, instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel with a new comment page look or silly autoplay and Shorts hooks. Specifically, there are five features I wish YouTube would add that I’d be willing to pay more for. Here they are.",

    "summary": "Unlike other Android phones, the Pixel 10 supports GPU-accelerated rendering for Linux apps in Android 16 QPR2.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding GPU acceleration for graphical Linux apps to Android’s Terminal app, but the feature is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10. This feature relies on Gfxstream, a library that forwards graphics API calls from the guest Linux virtual machine to the host Android device’s GPU for accelerated rendering. Though the feature is live for Pixel 10 users in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3, it’s still buggy and doesn’t yet offer the near-native performance expected. Back in March, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app to Android, which uses virtualization to run full-fledged Linux programs on Android devices. While the initial release only supported command-line apps, Google is addressing that limitation in the upcoming Android 16 QPR2 update. Even though Android 16 QPR2 will add support for graphical desktop Linux apps , they will run poorly on most Android devices. This is because the Linux Terminal app currently relies on a software-based renderer called Lavapipe. Lavapipe uses the device’s CPU for complex calculations and rasterization (the process of converting vector graphics into pixels) — tasks that the device’s GPU can perform much more quickly and efficiently.",

This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard.

Samsung has recently released the Galaxy S25 FE (), and I’ve spent just over two weeks with it. The good news is that the company is stepping up its game with a couple of long-overdue upgrades. But is this enough to make the phone worth buying? Let’s dive into our Galaxy S25 FE review.",

    "body": "TL;DR The ANBERNIC RG DS is a new dual-screen handheld with a DS Lite form factor. A new video showcases not just Nintendo DS emulation, but also lightweight 3DS emulation. Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

    "body": "Amazon rarely undercuts its own products, but when the company quietly slipped a caveat into the FAQ for its new Colorsoft Kindle , it made one thing abundantly clear: if you care about crisp, black-and-white reading, buy something else. As someone who still acts like they’ll earn a pizza party if they read enough books, I spend a lot of time with my Kindle. Amazon’s honest take doesn’t surprise me (and won’t surprise anyone who’s read on both types of e-reader), but it’s a rare day I find myself agreeing with the company about anything. Kindle Colorsoft’s honest fine print",
