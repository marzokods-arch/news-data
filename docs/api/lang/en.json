In Thailand, it’s actually a pretty common name. It’s used more often for girls than boys, though,” he laughs. When BamBam left Bangkok for Seoul in 2010, he was just 14 years old. He began his trainee life at JYP Entertainment, the company that produced 2PM, home to Nichkhun — the first Thai-born K-pop idol. After years of rigorous training, BamBam debuted in 2014 as part of GOT7 . The seven-member GOT7 is a truly multinational group, featuring BamBam, Jackson Wang from Hong Kong and Mark Tuan, who is Taiwanese-American. Perhaps because of this diversity, GOT7 quickly built a global fandom, holding world tours that reached beyond Asia to North and South America, Australia and Europe — faster than most K-pop groups that debuted around the same time. Their 2018 Eyes on You Tour even earned a spot at No. 9 on Billboard ’s monthly top 10 Hot Tours list . Since January 2021, all the members of GOT7 have left JYP Entertainment. …",

Often drawing comparisons to Donald Glover &#8216;s Atlanta (Staples told Complex that he consulted Glover and his team), the show is loosely based on Vince Staples &#8216; life and has a surreal vibe to it. While the first season was centered on the random adventures and situations that he finds himself in as a somewhat famous person, the second season focuses on a death in the family and the trauma that comes with it, but in a way that can only come from the creative mind of Vince Staples. Earlier this year, Staples explained how he helped Netflix executives grasp the concept of the show. “The way the show was written — and this was always the intention &nbsp;— The Vince Stapes Show &nbsp;is not about Vince Staples as a character,” the rapper and actor told the After Hours podcast. “It’s about a perspective.
