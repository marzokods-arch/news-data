    "body": "After spending years being lauded in R&amp;B circles, Seattle-raised singer-songwriter UMI, 26, is taking lessons learned from past label experiences to spin her evocative, folk-infused People Stories album into a globally resonant healing experience. A Black and Japanese artist who broke through with 2018’s “Remember Me” after years of running the SoundCloud circuit, UMI spent the past seven years solidifying her fanbase and fine-tuning her artistry through international tours, her 2022 debut album, Forest in the City, and collaborations with the likes of BTS’ V (“Wherever U R”) and Joyce Wrice (“That’s On You”). Armed with a pen that effortlessly balances hyper-specificity and universality — and a voice tender and grounded enough to convey the vast expanse of human emotion — UMI plays on the folky, bluesier edges of R&amp;B, which can be traced back to the oral-based storytelling traditions of West African griots. That level of introspection can, at times, conflict with an industry more concerned with packaging and selling, and that tension has informed the way UMI moved inside and outside of the label system for the past decade. With People Stories , an album that blends Japane…",

    "body": "TL;DR This past summer, Gmail tested adding a “mark as read” option to Android notifications. That’s now ready to roll out widely, and should be hitting Gmail users everywhere. Email may have a reputation as being a bit clunky and inelegant compared to texting or DMs for quick conversation, but with it as broadly compatible as it is, we still find ourselves falling back to it over and over again. Sometimes it even feels almost as easy as texting, and you don’t even need to fully open an email to get all you need from it, and the info in your notification is more than enough. If that sounds like your experience, you’re going to be a big fan of Gmail’s new notification option. It’s been a couple months now, but this past summer we started getting reports from users about a new option showing up in Gmail notifications, no longer just letting you delete an email or start crafting a reply to it, but now letting you directly mark it as read , right from the notification. While we saw multiple Gmail users getting access, this was also far from generally available, and it looked like Google was still testing the feature out.",

    "body": "After breaking through as a Gen Z pop singer, D4vd has been making headlines in relation to a tragedy over the past few weeks. The artist, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, rose to fame as a genre-blending musician after pivoting away from YouTube content creation; up until last week, he was in the throes of a massive world tour. Now, those tour dates have been cancelled, following the early September discovery of a deceased teenage girl in a car registered to the singer. On Sept. 8, a decomposed body was found in the singer’s impounded Tesla. Authorities identified the decomposed remains — which were discovered in the Tesla’s trunk while the car was in a Los Angeles tow lot — using forensics, and determined that the body belonged to 15-year-old Celeste Rivas. According to NBC News , the teen had been reported as missing and was last seen in April 2024, and her death is being investigated as a homicide. Following the identification of the body, the Internet exploded with speculative detective work, drawing connections between Rivas and D4vd, and linking the singer to the case. The singer’s rep previously said in a statement that D4vd is “fully cooperating with the authoritie…",

But those artists didn’t reach the summit on their own. Far from it.

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging. Xiaomi has confirmed that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 series is fully compatible with 100W PPS charging.",

The road back was difficult. It took several years before he could talk comfortably about the episode; instead, he got reacquainted with his guitar and started writing obsessively —&nbsp; three or four songs a day — as he explored the dark spaces in his life. Slowly, the songs began to incorporate flashes of hope as he recognized he could reshape his stories.

We’ll start with the updates to curated spaces. Spaces live at the top of the Apps tab in the Play Store (next to For You, Top charts, etc.) and are curated collections of apps around a specific topic. Google first started testing spaces last year in India and Japan with its Cricket Hub and Comics spaces, respectively.",

The indie surf-rock outfit returns with Love Balloon , their fifth studio album which got air last Friday, Sept. 19 via Community Music. For the first time, the Australian six-piece worked with legendary rock producer Nick DiDia (Bruce Springsteen, Rage Against The Machine), following an introduction from former Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning. “You can tell how experienced he is,&#8221; enthuses vocalist Baden Donegal, &#8220;because he was just so laid back and everything just gets done and on time. He just knows what&#8217;s down the road, and we&#8217;re still learning all of that.” After a couple beers and some rounds of golf with DiDia, the musicians just “hung out like mates” and talked a little bit about music. “It was just the most cruisy kind of mutual relationship that we&#8217;ve had so far,” recounts bassist Nic Blom. The result is cruisy, too. Spreading across 10 tracks, Love Balloon is a dreamy, chilled journey that should hit the target with the Australian band’s growing fanbase. Led by the singles “Tangerine,” “Left Of The Dealer” and the title track, the new set was recorded over three sti…",

That’s the familiar path we’ve all taken for years now; it’s so simple that we don’t give it a second thought each time we’re looking for a new app or game or trying a cool new service. But that’s not the only way anymore. Android now offers a few more options both when installing and uninstalling apps. Since most of the apps I use are permanent fixtures on my phone, the only time I really need to install or uninstall an app is when I’m trying something new. Most people probably fall in the same category: You’ve got your preferred music streaming service, social media apps, productivity tools, and more; everything is already chosen. So when you need to try out something new, I recommend you use these tricks instead.",

Simple text-based functionality consumes the least compute, which is why we’re seeing small additions creep up in several apps — in addition to Gboard’s writing tools . While messaging apps have largely been the focus for text generation or correction with AI, Google is also testing functions across other apps, and Google Keep is one of them.

It was literally like you’d written the thing.” And hitting those bigger notes, he did it “with ease,” the former One Direction singer remarked. That was all part of Horan’s slick pitch.

These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next?

This build shows tree, grass, and ragweed pollen levels on color-coded leaf icons, linking to Weather.com for details. The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

Gemini appears to be working on a new mode that would infer when you’re talking about your screen, and then automatically analyze it. Google would also offer settings to disable this functionality, so Gemini would need explicit permission to look at your screen. How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool.

As T-Mobile announces a new CEO and its commitment to a digital-first experience (meaning more focus online and less in-store), Verizon’s digital-first brand Visible is taking a different approach . To be clear, Visible will not be opening its own stores or abandoning its online-first model, but customers can now sign up for service directly at Best Buy locations nationwide. Best Buy will provide SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and face-to-face support for customers who are interested in Visible but turned off by its current online-only model. Ultimately, this move is about giving consumers more ways to sign up, though the plans and features remain the same as those available online.",

Google seems to be testing a refresh of the way voice search looks inside the Google app , including the Shazam-like song search section. To the surprise of no one, the redesign makes it feel more in line with the company’s AI features. As spotted by Telegram user @shishirverm, the change has started showing up in version 16.36.40.sa.arm64 beta of the Google app. Right now, tapping the microphone icon in the Google app or the home screen widget brings up a screen that says “listening…” and some recent searches plus search suggestions underneath. If you press the “Search for a song” button, you get another page with an animation and a small prompt to play, sing, or hum a song.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track.

We discovered the code strings for the feature hidden in the leaked One UI 8.5 firmware. Samsung is also preparing a language-selection option for automatic call screening. Samsung only just rolled out One UI 8 to Galaxy phones, but a huge One UI 8.5 leak is already spilling details about what’s coming next. As expected, One UI 8.5 looks like a bigger update than One UI 8, and one of its upcoming additions is a much-loved Pixel feature that is finally making its way to Galaxy devices.",

A few months ago, I started thinking about switching to a Pixel for the first time since the Pixel 3 XL. After the Pixel 10 launched, I pulled the trigger and bought a 10 Pro . After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place. Toggling all of the alarms in a group with the press of a single button saves time and is so much easier than having to scroll through a list of alarms to find the right ones.",

A minimalist phone that serves my essential needs and nothing more. As a millennial with Gen Z tendencies, it’s pretty clear that I’m the audience for this phone. Every September, iPhones get bigger, heavier, and more stuffed with specs. It’s the progression of tech, and by and large, people value a phone by its hardware-to-dollar quotient. But with the iPhone Air, Apple has gone in the opposite direction. The phone is built impossibly slim, almost delicate, like a product designed as much as the set piece of a fashion-forward futuristic movie as for the Apple Store. It reminds me of the first-generation iPod nano. I scoffed at it when it launched. Then got my hands on it. It quickly became my favorite EDC kit. And that’s exactly why I didn’t scoff at the iPhone Air. Hindsight is 20/20.",

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years.

Teams are finishing integration of the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis II test flight with its launch abort system on Sept. 17 inside the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 44-foot-tall tower-like abort structure would swiftly carry the four-person crew inside Orion to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency during launch or ascent atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Over the next few weeks, teams will complete remaining closeout activities before moving the spacecraft to its final stop before the launch pad: the agency’s Vehicle Assembly Building. There it will be added to the top of the rocket, before the finished stack is rolled out to the launch pad on its way to the Moon. The abort system is comprised of three solid rocket motors :&nbsp;the jettison, attitude, and abort motors. In the case of an emergency, these motors work together to propel the astronauts inside Orion’s crew module to safety: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle; the attitude control motor steers and orients th…",

Along the way, a partnership between NASA wind tunnel engineers, data visualization scientists, and software developers verified a quick, cost-effective solution to improve NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for the upcoming Artemis II mission. This will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, on an approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. &nbsp; A high-speed network connection between high-end computing resources at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility and the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel , both located at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California&#8217;s Silicon Valley, is enabling a collaboration to improve the rocket for the Artemis II mission. During the Artemis I test flight, the SLS rocket experienced higher-than-expected vibrations near the solid rocket booster attach points, caused by unsteady airflow between the gap. One solution proposed for Artemis II was adding four strakes. A strake is a thin, fin-like structure commonly us…",
