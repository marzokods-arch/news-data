    "body": "Taylor Swift ’s The Life of a Showgirl spends its first month atop the Billboard 200 chart, as it racks up its fourth straight week at No. 1 (on the chart dated Nov. 8). It earned 146,000 equivalent album units (down 25%) in the United States in the week ending Oct. 30, according to Luminate. The Life of a Showgirl is only the second album in 2025 to spend its first month at No. 1, following Morgan Wallen’s I’m the Problem (which spent its first eight weeks atop the list, of its total 12 at No. 1). Swift’s own The Tortured Poets Department spent its first 12 weeks at No. 1 in 2024, of its total 17 weeks atop the list. With The Life of a Showgirl spending a fourth week at No. 1, Swift adds her 90th career week at No. 1 on the chart, extending her record among soloists . Elvis Presley has the second-most among soloists, with 67. The total encompasses her 15 No. 1 albums, the most among soloists. Only The Beatles have more weeks at No. 1 (132) and more No. 1 albums (19) among all artists. Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, new releases from Daniel Caesar, Brandi Carlile and Demi Lovato all debut. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.…",

This is because the Exynos 2500 suffered some rather notable issues. First, production yield issues and delays meant Samsung had to skip the chip entirely for the Galaxy S25 series . When it finally arrived in the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the performance was pretty lackluster; in CPU performance, it was no faster than last year’s Snapdragon rival, and there were only marginal gains in graphics.",

A desk charger like the Pixelsnap Charger with Stand , a magnetic wallet, a MagSafe-compatible tripod — all of these are good ideas. But the one accessory I was personally looking forward to the most is a Qi2 power bank. Just snap it on the back of my phone and get a relatively fast charge without any wires or tangles. I ended up with several of these portable batteries to test out, and while I do appreciate their convenience, one thing stood out in all of my tests: You should really be wary of the battery’s capacity. 10,000mAh won’t be enough to charge your ~5,000mAh Pixel 10, 10 Pro, or 10 Pro XL more than once.",

The company has yet to officially confirm the date, but industry sources cited by the publication indicate that Samsung has begun preparations for the launch. If the leaked Galaxy S26 launch date is accurate, this would mark Samsung’s first San Francisco-based Galaxy S event since the launch of the Galaxy S23 series in 2023.",

The two songs are from Carlile’s eighth studio album, Returning to Myself , released Oct. 25.

Alcohol silenced my intuition, blocked my dreams and chased my circulating fears of complacency.” She continued, “Today I am clear. Today I am driven by faith. Both fear and faith are something that we feel and may not see, I’m so happy I chose faith over fear. It was not in the fight that I found my strength, it was in the surrender.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson) The “With You” singer has been open about her journey to sobriety since revealing in her 2020 memoir Open Book that she quit drinking in 2017.

    "summary": "Android almost had its own IRS that would audit apps for their battery usage. Here’s how it would’ve worked.",
    "body": "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Google restricting background work. With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

Its postpaid phone service actually lost 7,000 subscribers during this period. With T-Mobile edging ever closer to surpassing Verizon’s total subscriber count, it’s clear big changes are needed if Verizon wants to turn this ship around. Verizon’s new CEO, Dan Schulman, insists the company is working hard to do just that, and that it will “no longer be the hunting ground for competitors looking to gain share”.",

As enamored by the Pixel as I was, I stopped using Pixels for over six years, and with good reason. The Pixel 10 Pro , though, is the phone I’ve been waiting for Google to make. What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

However, a new offer that you won’t see advertised on the site makes its 12-month plans even cheaper. For a limited time, new customers can get 30% off all 12-month fixed-data plans using the code YEAROFMINT . That drops the 5GB plan from $15 to $10.50 per month, paid upfront for the year.

Numerous YouTube executives have given testimony that directly rebuts that claim. Now Committee on the Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin is demanding answers. The past ten months have got to be the start of one of the most embarrassing years for tech heavyweights in recent memory. One after the other, firms like Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, and of course, Google, have been prostrating themselves before a government administration they’d previously butted heads with . But in 2025, acquiescence is the name of the game, and rather than bracing for another four years of conflict, they’ve instead been kissing the ring. A few weeks back, that extended to YouTube performing a massive about-face on the necessary steps it had taken to ban some of the worst voices on its platform , spreading lies, hate, and disinformation — instead opening the door to restore their access. That move was telegraphed in late September when Alphabet legal counsel submitted a letter to the House Committee on the Judiciary, blaming COVID-era YouTube moderation policies on pressure the co…",

Google’s keenly aware of that: It offers a version of the YouTube app that’s explicitly made for children’s content in YouTube Kids, and earlier this year, rolled out a controversial AI-based age estimation system to automatically flag accounts that may be used by minors. These measures are meant in part to help Google avoid legal trouble — like a 2019 class-action suit filed in California accusing Google and YouTube of violating privacy laws by collecting information about minors for the purposes of advertising.

These summaries seem to be rolling out generally, but are not universally available yet. Generative AI’s whole deal, when you boil it down, is absorbing existing information and then serving it up in other forms. That process can be wildly complex, as in the case of generative video — but on the simpler end of the spectrum, AI can be very helpful for parsing large bodies of text to create concise summaries. Google’s started putting its AI to work in the latter way on the Play Store, where you’ll soon see AI-generated summaries of aggregated user app reviews. We were able to activate these AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store more than a year ago , but now, they’re starting to appear broadly, no fiddling required.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority Protecting our expensive new smartphone is a top priority for many of us, and online marketplaces are flooded with options, from cases to display protection . An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer.

This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

It follows a similar design to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, including Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, but with a lower clock speed than the Elite Gen 5. In addition to launching the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 earlier than usual this year, Qualcomm also confirmed it is working on the non-Elite variant of the chipset. The standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 has yet to hit the market, but Qualcomm has already shared some specifics about the chipset, including a vague description of the CPU. Now, a recent leak is plugging any previous gap in information with more details. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared specifications for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, including its CPU and GPU . Per the leak, the chipset is set to be fabricated on TSMC’s N3P 3nn process, identical to the Elite edition.
