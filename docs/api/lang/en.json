    "body": "Olivia Dean shows no signs of loosening her hold on Australia’s charts. Her second album, The Art of Loving , remains at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart for a third non-consecutive week, extending one of the year’s most consistent chart runs. The achievement adds to a standout year for women on the ARIA albums tally. Dean becomes the ninth female artist to land a No. 1 album in 2025, joining a list that includes Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde and Taylor Swift — a run that’s shaped much of the year’s chart narrative. Dean is also doubling up at the top. Her single “Man I Need” clocks a fifth straight week at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the fourth solo female artist to lead the singles tally in 2025, alongside Lola Young, Doechii and Swift. The year’s singles race has largely been driven by women, from Rosé’s extended reign with “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars to the surprise dominance of “Golden” by fictional K-pop group HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters . Further down the albums chart, new releases and catalogue favorites share the spotlight. The 50th anniversary edition of Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here opens…",

Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space.
