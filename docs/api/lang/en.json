    "body": "TL;DR One UI 8.5 has leaked, and one new feature we’ve already spotted appears to be a system for combatting photosensitive epilepsy. Your phone will detect when video contains flashing lights, and automatically dim the screen. It’s still unclear if this will be available for all devices getting One UI 8.5, and if it will work for gaming. Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) may often be played for comic effect on shows like The Simpsons, where characters are briefly disabled by a strobing light. The reality of the condition is far from a laughing matter, though, and for vulnerable individuals, everything from playing video games to streaming media can feel like navigating a minefield, never sure when you’re going to run across triggering conditions. Thankfully, Samsung appears to be working on a handy solution. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

In July, CEO Daniel Ek said he was “unhappy” with the company’s advertising business, and executives laid out their efforts to turn it around. Some changes would be technical, such as giving brands the ability to buy programmatic ads through platforms such as The Trade Desk. The move to allow free streamers to choose their songs rather than listen on shuffle mode was more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with free, ad-supported music isn’t confined to Spotify, though. Around the world, streaming revenue from audio and video supported by advertising fell sharply in the first half of the year. In the U.S., free streaming — both audio and video — from on-demand and social platforms fell 2.9% to $875 million, worse than the 1.8% decline in all of 2024.

The Galaxy Buds 4 carry the model number SM-R540, while the model number for the Buds 4 Pro is SM-R640. For comparison, the model numbers for Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are SM-R530 and SM-R630, respectively. It’s been over a year since Samsung launched the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. As such, you may be wondering what exactly is going on with Samsung’s next premium wireless earbuds . Rumors have been pointing to a release in early 2026, possibly launching during the first Galaxy Unpacked of the year. Outside of a few other details, there isn’t a whole lot of information to parse through yet. However, we are learning something new today about the next-generation earbuds — the model numbers. Although stable One UI 8 is just starting to arrive on Galaxy devices, Samsung is already working on One UI 8.5. That update appears to have leaked , as some people are digging into an alleged modified build. In a tip sent to Android Authority , the code within that build seems to provide the very first reference to the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro .",

Soon, Nexstar, the largest U.S. owner of TV stations, announced that it would preempt Kimmel’s show — followed by ABC itself.&nbsp; The practical lesson here is not only that the Trump administration is trying to exert more control over the media, it’s that it has more tools to do so than most people realize.

Teams are finishing integration of the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis II test flight with its launch abort system on Sept. 17 inside the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 44-foot-tall tower-like abort structure would swiftly carry the four-person crew inside Orion to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency during launch or ascent atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Over the next few weeks, teams will complete remaining closeout activities before moving the spacecraft to its final stop before the launch pad: the agency’s Vehicle Assembly Building. There it will be added to the top of the rocket, before the finished stack is rolled out to the launch pad on its way to the Moon. The abort system is comprised of three solid rocket motors :&nbsp;the jettison, attitude, and abort motors. In the case of an emergency, these motors work together to propel the astronauts inside Orion’s crew module to safety: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle; the attitude control motor steers and orients th…",

Xbox mode frees up about 2GB of memory that can be used for gaming. You’ll launch straight into the Xbox app with your full library of PC games from Steam, Battle.net, Epic, and other storefronts. About a month from now, Microsoft will be launching its ROG Xbox Ally devices. These Xbox-branded gaming handhelds are technically supposed to be the first to debut Microsoft’s new gaming mode for Windows 11. I say technically because it looks like some Windows handheld PC owners found a way to get the highly-anticipated Xbox mode running early on their older hardware. If you’re not in the know, Xbox mode is a new gaming mode for Windows 11 that’s optimized for handheld systems. It was a feature Microsoft announced along with the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X earlier this year. This special configuration suppresses unnecessary background processes and doesn’t run Explorer, allowing devices to save about 2GB of memory, which can be redirected toward gaming.",

The redesign renames “For You” as “Home” and adds more shortcuts to the profile menu. Only a small number of devices seem to have the update so far. Google TV hasn’t been having the best luck in the crowded smart TV market recently. With relatively low adoption in the US and advertisers favoring YouTube instead, Google seems to be rethinking parts of the TV platform, starting with a potential refresh of the home screen design. As spotted by 9to5Google , the update is showing up through an apparent server-side change on top of Google TV Home version 1.0.806977084. Navigation is split into two pill-shaped clusters that sit above the content feed. One holds “Home,” “Live,” and “Apps” alongside a search shortcut, while the other contains quick-access buttons for settings and the screensaver. A built-in tooltip even explains the switch, noting that “For You” has been renamed “Home” and that search now lives in this section.",

    "body": "NASA/JPL-Caltech In this infrared photograph taken on June 2, 2025, the Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Table Mountain Facility near Wrightwood, California, beams its eight-laser beacon to the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) flight laser transceiver aboard NASA’s Psyche spacecraft. At the time, when Psyche was about 143 million miles (230 million kilometers) from Earth. Managed by JPL, DSOC successfully demonstrated that data encoded in laser photons could be reliably transmitted, received, and then decoded after traveling millions of miles from Earth out to Mars distances. Nearly two years after launching aboard the agency’s Psyche mission in 2023, the demonstration completed its 65th and final “pass” on Sept. 2, 2025, sending a laser signal to Psyche and receiving the return signal from 218 million miles (350 million kilometers) away.

One of the biggest changes in the Pixel 10 series is the Tensor G5 processor’s new PowerVR GPU, built by Imagination Technologies. Browsing through the graphics chip’s specs, a few things stand out. The core can support ray-tracing, but Google seems to have left this unimplemented. The peak GPU clock is reported at 1.1GHz; however, corners of the web suggest that the core is significantly downclocked to just 400MHz . Some have even suggested that driver issues could be to blame for its less-than-stellar benchmark results . Others point out that it could just be an app reporting issue .

I spent several months throughout the year dipping back into the most premium Pixel whenever I got the chance between testing other phones, and I felt like it just kept improving with each passing update. Eventually, though, I started looking to the future. I wondered how Google could follow its best launch ever and worried it might push too far and lose the magic.

The idea is to break down language barriers in real time and make phone conversations smoother when you and the person on the other end speak completely different languages. What’s even more fascinating is that Voice Translate attempts to mimic the voice of the speakers in order to make conversations sound more natural. I decided to test out this sorcery for myself, translating calls between English and Hindi (my mother tongue), and came away with a mix of awe, amusement, and a few headaches.",

Kindle Unlimited provides access to millions of titles and works on Kindle devices and the free Kindle app. The promo is part of the lead-up to this year’s Prime Big Deal Days beginning on October 7, 2025. Amazon is already baiting book lovers ahead of its October Prime Big Deal Days. Right now, members can sign up for three months of Kindle Unlimited at no cost, running back a similar promo we saw ahead of Prime Day in July. Normally $11.99 a month, Kindle Unlimited unlocks millions of ebook titles, plus audiobooks, comics, and magazines. With a subscription, users can borrow up to 20 titles at a time, which is ambitious even for the most committed of bedrotters. You also don’t need a Kindle to utilize Kindle Unlimited, since everything included works seamlessly in the free Kindle app on Android (or iOS). In other words, if you don’t have a Kindle, you can still sign up for the free period and read or listen on your phone or tablet.",

The device was a smart speaker that looked like a cross between an Amazon Echo Dot and an Apple HomePod Mini. While Google has yet to say anything about the smart speaker since the teaser, a new report may have revealed some details. According to strings in version 3.41 of Google Home for Android (via 9to5Google ), this unannounced device may be called the “Google Home Speaker.” This is interesting as it signals a departure from the Nest branding and a homecoming to the Google Home naming scheme. Of course, it’s always possible that this name could just be a placeholder.",

Along the way, a partnership between NASA wind tunnel engineers, data visualization scientists, and software developers verified a quick, cost-effective solution to improve NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for the upcoming Artemis II mission. This will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, on an approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. &nbsp; A high-speed network connection between high-end computing resources at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility and the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel , both located at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California&#8217;s Silicon Valley, is enabling a collaboration to improve the rocket for the Artemis II mission. During the Artemis I test flight, the SLS rocket experienced higher-than-expected vibrations near the solid rocket booster attach points, caused by unsteady airflow between the gap.

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s Phone app has historically forced a portrait orientation while making calls. Users have recently noticed that this no longer holds true, and some devices set to auto-rotate will turn even in calls. We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR We’ve spotted that Google Tasks looks to be testing deadline support. Deadlines would only be an option to add when editing a task, rather than when it’s created. The test version does not allow you to specify a deadline time and does not display the due date in the main list view. Google Tasks has always been a bare-bones tool. For some, that’s part of the appeal, but its stripped-down approach often leaves power users wanting more . The lack of sharing, location-based reminders, or even simple priority options makes it feel like a lightweight option compared to fuller apps like TickTick. Google does seem to be listening to the critics and experimenting with upgrades, though. We recently spotted potential upcoming support for attaching Google Drive files to tasks through Calendar. Now, another long-requested feature looks to be in testing.",

    "body": "5 min read New NASA Mission to Reveal Earth’s Invisible ‘Halo’ This story is also available in Spanish . A new NASA mission will capture images of Earth’s invisible “halo,” the faint light given off by our planet’s outermost atmospheric layer, the exosphere, as it morphs and changes in response to the Sun. Understanding the physics of the exosphere is a key step toward forecasting dangerous conditions in near-Earth space, a requirement for protecting Artemis astronauts traveling through the region on the way to the Moon or on future trips to Mars. The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory will launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 23. Revealing Earth’s invisible edge In the early 1970s, scientists could only speculate about how far Earth’s atmosphere extended into space. The mystery was rooted in the exosphere, our atmosphere’s outermost layer, which begins some 300 miles up. Theorists conceived of it as a cloud of hydrogen atoms — the lightest element in existence — that had risen so high the atoms were actively escaping into space. But the exosphere reveals itself only via a faint “halo” of ultraviolet light known as the geocorona. Pioneeri…",

Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

Earlier this month, Google brought its Androidify app back from the grave. The company updated the app to leverage its latest AI models to create a fully personalized Android Bot from a photo or text prompt. The result is amazing, making the new Androidify app a great tool for generating social media avatars , especially for Android fans. While it’s easy to set your custom Android Bot as your wallpaper, banner, or avatar, setting it as your watch face is not so straightforward. Most watch faces don’t support custom images, preventing you from showing off your personalized bot.

This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones. We discovered evidence for the new setting in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, but the setting isn’t live yet. For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation.

On the surface, the Nothing Ear 3 appear identical to the Ear (2024) and Ear 2 (2023), which themselves looked similar to the Ear 1 (2021).

    "body": "TL;DR Google is officially adding native step tracking to Health Connect, as confirmed by Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2. The company announced the change today, and a new banner and “Devices” page within the app now explicitly state Health Connect will track your phone’s steps for other apps to use. This marks a significant shift for the platform, turning it from a simple data hub into a fitness tracking service. Last week, we reported that Google was bringing native step tracking to Health Connect , allowing the app to count your steps using your phone’s sensors. This marks a significant shift for the app, which currently doesn’t track any data on its own and instead acts as a hub for information from other health and fitness services. While that was its original purpose, it seems Google has bigger plans for the platform . This change suggests Health Connect could transform from a simple data hub into a full-fledged tracking platform, with native step counting being just the first step. When we first reported on this feature, though, we noted some uncertainty. Our evidence came from an analysis of the APK in the 2508 Android Canary release , but the feature itself wasn’t functional yet,…",

The software brings several key improvements, like expressive design, enhanced protection against malicious apps, and more transparent background activities. Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 8, based on Android 16, to the Galaxy S25 series . But Samsung isn’t the only brand rolling out the new Android OS to its devices this week. Motorola is also getting the ball rolling with a couple of its handsets. The stable version of Android 16 is starting to arrive on some Motorola phones. The first devices getting the software are the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (via YTECHB ) and the Edge 50 Fusion (via Gizmochina ). On top of that, it seems the release is only happening in specific markets at the moment, which include Brazil for the Edge 60 Pro and Mexico for the Edge 50 Fusion. It appears Motorola is taking a phased approach to its rollout before the broader release.",

Smartphones may be our bread and butter, but we are absolute suckers around here for a nice handheld gaming console — so we were understandably very excited earlier this month when we got word about the ANBERNIC RG 476H on the way. At the time we made some inferences about the hardware we were likely to get, and it sure felt like this model could be shaping up to be a budget-friendly alternative to some of its peers. Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

As someone who has been a thin-phone skeptic, I’ve looked at the iPhone Air’s launch with the same disdain I reserved for the Galaxy S25 Edge : Why would anyone trade off crucial features like battery life and camera versatility for a flagship whose primary claim-to-fame is that it’s thin? After using the iPhone Air for about a day, I get it. I see why thin phones are hyped, though there’s still a long way to go before they become the default recommendation. The iPhone Air feels fantastic to hold",

According to the announcement, Nothing OS 4.0 features a more minimalist design, camera enhancements, and a new AI dashboard to track usage across various AI apps. The launch date hasn’t been announced, but Nothing says an open beta is coming soon. Stable Android 16 has been available for months, but Samsung is the only brand to have released a stable Android 16-based update for its devices. Others, like OnePlus, have begun closed beta programs, though details about its wider rollout remain scant. Nothing may be following soon, and has now announced some more details about its upcoming closed beta program for the Nothing OS 4.0 based on Android 16. Following its teaser last week — and yesterday’s announcement about ambitious products , phone brand Nothing has shared another preview of its upcoming Android 16-based OS.

I bring it along on road trips and plug it into my accommodation’s TV. This saves me from whipping out my laptop or logging into my accounts on a stranger’s TV, and also gives me far more control over the content I have access to.

Sometimes, it’s the simplest things in the world that end up causing our most unexpected headaches. Google’s Clock app is about as straightforward as they come: it tells the time, lets you set alarms, and can run a stopwatch or a timer. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a recent update addressed our lack of imagination there, as users found the time rendered in unexpected ways, impairing visibility. Thankfully, it looks like some fixes are already arriving.

The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung.
