The Scottish singer and songwriter Lewis Capaldi has made it through a dark time, and is back, very much on top of his game, playing the biggest stages on earth and cratering sales charts. Rewind to summer 2023, and Capaldi struggled to complete his set at Glastonbury Festival, due to flare-ups with Tourette&#8217;s syndrome. The pop singer took the best part of two years off, to focus on his mental health, and made a triumphant return to the stage at this year’s Glastonbury. Last month, he dropped the EP Survive, the followup to his 2023 LP &nbsp;Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent , which was sent to No. 1 in the U.K. for three weeks and spawned three U.K. chart-leading singles in “Pointless,” “Wish You The Best” and “Forget Me”. Now, comeback kid Capaldi is winding his way around Australia for a sold-out tour , which is produced by Live Nation and wraps up next Wednesday, Dec. 17 at Perth’s RAC Arena. While visiting these parts, Capaldi stopped by The Hit Network’s Carrie &amp; Tommy for an open and candid chat about his therapy, medication and the lifestyle changes that helped him get over the hump and fall in love with m…",

The feature now lets you record only a portion of the screen, rather than the entire screen. However, it’s currently slightly challenging to work with, especially if you use swipe gestures for navigation, and we hope Samsung fixes it. After months of leaks, Samsung’s next big update, One UI 8.5, is finally ready for beta testing. And it brings a highly modified interface that could spark opinions about drawing inspiration from Apple’s iOS 26 . But in addition to the renewed system UI and apps, One UI 8.5 is also bringing improvements to key functionalities, and one of them is how screen recording works. With Samsung’s first official One UI 8.5 beta build released, we’re now seeing a new menu for screen recording features. One of the chief changes is the ability to record only a part of the screen instead of the entire screen, which is easier than cropping the video later.",

For Swift, it’s just a matter of time before she gets the Rock Hall call. Swift, however, struggled to complete her task. “This is so much pressure,” she told the Colbert. “You’re already writing five.” Party pooper alert: the “Shake It Off” singer requested a “little time to get back to” Colbert for the definitive list. “Because I don’t have enough, see,” she continued. “I think I require a little bit of time to like, appreciate my work in a way… and it’s constantly changing, right. It’s a little too soon.” Swift was able to select her first choice, “All Too Well,” the 10-minute version, which was released as part of the re-recorded Red (Taylor&#8217;s Version) from November 2021. “I’m really obsessed with The Life of a Showgirl righ…",

Prime minister Anthony Albanese&#8217;s center-left Labor government last year proposed groundbreaking laws that would block under-16s from accessing TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and other services, citing research that shows overexposure to social media can accelerate mental health problems for young people. Those rules passed through parliament in November 2024 , with bipartisan support, and came into effect this Wednesday, Dec. 10. Australia is the first country to embark on this grand, social experiment. No doubt other countries are watching closely. The music industry has been watching closely, too. View this post on Instagram Kids and tweens are, so often, the noisiest superfans of pop artists, a 24-7 connection that has been forged on social media in the past decade.

Foldable smartphones may all rely on the same basic flexible-display trick, but how manufacturers go about designing them still varies wildly — and things are only getting more complicated as we move further into the dual-fold era with devices like the (incredibly poorly named) Galaxy Z TriFold . So far, Motorola has only produced foldables of the same vertically unfolding variety, but a potential teaser might just hint at a new direction — literally.

Another that’s been on our radar for a minute has been Speak, which emphasizes spoken conversations.

The RAM on the Homey Pro has been updated from 2GB to 4GB, now allowing it to run even more apps and workflows. The Homey Pro (2026) still costs the same, which isn’t very affordable, but it’s worth the investment, given its support lasts through 2031. Anyone who’s dabbled with smart home products from multiple brands will know what a mess it is. Different protocols, different apps, and each one requires signing up for a new account, just so you can turn a light on or off without getting out of bed. Thankfully, certain devices, including Homey, aim to address this fragmentation by serving as a single hub to control all your devices from a central location. When we reviewed the Homey Pro (2023) , we rated it 4.5 out of 5 for its ability to connect with and control virtually any smart device in your house. And now that the device is getting a newer model that’s ready for 2026, we expect similar performance, given its key upgrade. Homey’s updated hub to rule all your smart home devices comes with 4GB of RAM, twice as much as the older model. Homey’s creator Athom says doub…",

Earlier this week, Google showed us a glimpse of what Android XR could look like without bulky glasses covering up a part of your face. These will be light-use glasses that complement, rather than replace, standalone headsets such as the Galaxy XR. In the meantime, tethered glasses that serve as extended displays for devices such as handheld gaming devices, laptops, or iPads are increasingly popular. VITURE is already flourishing in this segment, with more than 50% of the market share in the US. And today, it is bringing a (sort of) new product, marking its fondness for gamers. VITURE has announced a special edition of its Luma XR glasses to mark the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077’s release. These new edition glasses, created as part of an official collaboration with CD PROJEKT RED, appear to be based on the Luma Pro, which was only announced in July this year along…",

This new API allows the default launcher to lock apps, eliminating the need to use third-party app lockers. We spotted code for this feature in a recent Android Canary build, though it isn’t expected to officially launch until next year’s major update. People store a lot of sensitive data on their Android phones , so it’s no wonder they are reluctant to hand them over to anyone they don’t trust. Even if you are comfortable letting a friend or family member borrow your device, you probably still have data you don’t want them to see. Locking down specific apps is a great way to protect your privacy, but the core Android OS still lacks a native way to do this, forcing many users — especially of Pixel devices — to rely on third-party tools. Fortunately, Google may finally address this in next year’s Android 17 update by adding a new App Lock feature.

The Pixel 10a is expected to be released next year, and while we’ve seen renders , there has been a surprising lack of leaks around its specifications and other details. That changes now, as a new leak is shedding light on key Pixel 10a specifications. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Innovative products such as the Galaxy Z TriFold and a folding iPhone could drive sales for the category. Meanwhile, sales of regular phones could decline or stagnate over the next few years. Worldwide smartphone sales have seen a meager growth in 2025. Different research agencies have cited growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 3% for the first, second, and third quarters of the year. Meanwhile, the foldable category expanded at a much faster rate, with Counterpoint reporting 14% year-on-year growth in Q3 2025, led by the success of the reinvented Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its rivals in the book-style format. In 2026, this growth could nearly double as new and innovative products, such as the Galaxy Z TriFold , help shape the future of the foldable segment. A more recent IDC report predicts that the foldable segment will grow steadily through 2029. The next year, i.e., 2026, specifically will see an enormous 29.7% year-on-year growth in foldable sales.

An enterprising developer recently released an app called LibrePods , which enables a more feature-rich AirPods experience on Android. The app currently requires root access, and it turns out that a long-standing Android Bluetooth bug is the reason for this requirement. LibrePods developer Kavish Devar posted a bug report on Google’s Issue Tracker back on October 6, 2024 (h/t: Hacker News ), noting the specific code that’s standing in the way of root-free AirPods support.

The update brings new features to Pixel Watch 4 and 3, and security updates to Pixel Watch 2 and newer. The original Pixel Watch is not eligible for the update. Earlier today, we covered some new Pixel Watch features: as of today, Pixel Watch 4 owners are getting access to new gesture controls , and both Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 4 users will enjoy improved Smart Replies . This is all part of Wear OS 6.1, which is based on Android 16 QPR2 and is rolling out starting today with the December update for Pixel Watch 4, 3, and 2. Google ‘s shared a post on the Pixel Watch Help forum detailing the update. It’s a pretty significant update for the latest Pixel Watch 4, which is gaining access to a new double pinch gesture similar to the one you’ll find on Apple’s and Samsung’s watches, plus a wrist turn gesture that brings to mind older Android Wear watches.",

The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete.

AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web. The interface is quite similar to the web implementation, showing the same Meet AI Mode heading and “Ask anything” text box.",

The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone.

Similarly, there have been speculations about the chip of choice, with leaks suggesting Samsung might equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the other two models, with an Exynos chip instead of a Snapdragon in some regions. While the launch date remains uncertain, a recent certification might put speculation about the chipset to rest. The Galaxy S26 Ultra recently visited the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), which certified it ahead of the launch. The certification document (via The Tech Outlook ) includes different variants carrying SM-S948B, SM-S948B/DS, SM-S948U, and SM-S948U1, where U refers to the US variant, while B refers to the international variant…",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G. I hoped the Pixel 10 Pro XL would fix this, but so far, I’m just left scratching my head.",

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

According to users’ reports, the display on their Pixel 10 randomly freezes after the phone has been resting for a while. This isn’t the first display bug that the Pixel 10 users have been facing. The December Pixel Drop, which arrived exactly a week ago , was primarily aimed at eradicating a punch list of issues troubling users of the Pixel 6 and above. But in fixing those bugs, Google may have triggered a handful of new ones. After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

The “Magnet Wireless Battery Pack” was found on a certification page in the Wireless Power Consortium’s database. The product may further hint at Qi2 support on the Galaxy S26. It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

Of the 14 categories, Sunshiner is by far the most common type, while Philosopher and Trailblazer are the rarest at 0.1%. The spread reflects how many people use YouTube for lighter content, with only a tiny slice focusing on niche or deep-dive viewing. YouTube’s first full Recap seems to be going down well. In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with. There are 14 in total, and each one comes with a matching animated character designed by 3D artist Eva Cremers. You can see some examples of the characters below.",
