    "body": "TL;DR Google broke the Pixel IMS app that enabled VoLTE/VoWiFi on unsupported carriers, but the developer has already released a new workaround. Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

One of the biggest upgrades on the OnePlus 15 is the new 165Hz display, which the brand has already confirmed. Its prowess and improvements to high-intensity gameplay have also been vouched for in a pre-launch gaming review . Now, OnePlus is revealing more details about the display in a series of Weibo posts. For starters, the display is again made by BOE, which has been supplying displays since the OnePlus 12.",

Having access to smartphone apps that have no real desktop equivalent is a game-changer, and I’m not just saying that because I write for Android Authority . Unfortunately, Microsoft sunset its Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) experiment earlier this year, which allowed you to run Android apps on Windows 11 . And while Phone Link does still exist, it only allows you to mirror your smartphone’s screen. Moreover, Microsoft still hasn’t enabled screen sharing support for Pixel and the vast majority of other smartphones. So if I want the best of Android on PC, I have to choose between a Chrome OS device or an emulator.",

In a post titled “ Just turned my e-reader into a Spotify player ,” the user introduced Kindlify.co, a minimalist web interface that can turn your Kindle into a Spotify remote control. The concept is equal parts impressive and questionable. After all, Kindles were built for quiet reading sessions, not jams.

The beauty of Android is that it dynamically adapts to various formats and screen sizes almost seamlessly (surprisingly, it took Google so long to realize it would also work well on laptops !). This virtue has allowed Android to drive the resurgence of various ignored or abandoned form factors, such as decade-old Blackberrys . For Nintendo DS and 3DS fans specifically, it has led to the emergence of Android gaming handhelds armed with not one but two screens . After products from noted portable console makers, including AYANEO and AYN , another manufacturer — ANBERNIC — is throwing its hat into the ring with a new dual-screen handheld.

    "body": "TL;DR Google recently launched a new Home Brief feature for Google Home that summarizes daily home activity using camera footage. Some early users say the feature isn’t functioning accurately, reporting ghost sightings and misidentifying animals and objects. The feature is still in early access and costs $10/month as part of Google’s Home Premium plan. Google recently rolled out a major update to Google Home . Home Brief is one of the new Gemini-powered features that arrived with that update. It’s designed to give users a quick overview of their day by automatically identifying key household events and summarizing hours of footage into a short, easy-to-digest recap. The idea sounds promising, but it appears the feature isn’t working the way it should for everyone. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Technology waits for no one, though, and next-generation smartphone processors have already been revealed. We’ve even seen the first next-generation high-end phones in the Xiaomi 17 series .

I’ve mostly made up for this by revisiting my favorite retro games or snagging PC games on Steam with deep discounts, but recent developments in the Android world have given me new hope.",

    "body": "TL;DR The LineageOS team has released LineageOS 23.0, bringing Android 16 to over 100 different devices. This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions. The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi. VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the feature that routes voice calls over a 4G LTE connection, a crucial function now that carriers worldwide are phasing out their 2G and 3G networks.

This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there.

ISPs and cellular carriers both have a reputation for positively opaque billing practices, piling on fees and passing taxes along to end users. As a consequence, responsible lawmakers pushed for legislation aimed at simplifying bills, and forcing ISPs to be upfront and clear about all their fees.

User Setati said that their Echo Show 5 had stopped persistently showing the time on its home screen, instead surfacing news and other content. Setati says that canceling Alexa Plus removed the unwanted additional content from their Show 5’s screen. Alexa Plus is Amazon’s new paid digital assistant. Available for $20 per month (or included for free, if you’re a Prime subscriber), Alexa Plus injects extra AI functionality into your Amazon devices, like the ability to engage in more natural conversation-style interactions with Alexa through an Echo device. Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables. But did the company actually make real progress there, or have those claims been a little oversold? According to the latest iFixit teardown, the Pixel Watch 4 very much delivers when it comes to being able to service its hardware.",

    "body": "TL;DR Code in a leaked One UI 8.5 build shows Samsung is working on a utility to transfer eSIMs from iOS to Galaxy phones. Moving an eSIM from an iPhone to a Samsung one currently requires contacting your carrier. A One UI 8.5 beta is expected to kick off in November. Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

The duo interacts with Gemini in the car like one would with Gemini Live on their phones. The tech will arrive in the US before the end of the year, and the new Mercedes CLA will be the first production car to feature it. Just yesterday, we got an early look at Gemini inside Google Maps , and now, Google and Mercedes-Benz are giving us a first glimpse at how Gemini will soon be built directly into cars.

The projector offers 1080P resolution and runs Google TV for simple streaming access. While the speakers have a 20-hour battery, the projector itself requires an external power source. Portable projectors have long been a great space-saving alternative to a massive TV, but they often sacrifice audio quality to achieve their compact size. Anker’s Soundcore brand aims to solve that audio problem with its latest device, the Nebula P1 projector. The key feature of this projector is a pair of dual speakers that can be magnetically mounted to the projector or, crucially, detached and placed anywhere else in the room. This has the potential to bring you a wider soundstage and a more immersive sound experience, at least compared to most other projectors.",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
