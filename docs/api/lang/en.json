    "body": "The Galaxy S20 FE marked the debut of the Fan Edition for Samsung, and it was a sensation upon its release back in 2020. It was a genuine flagship-tier Android phone that didn’t break the bank. I’ve long felt like subsequent releases have failed to live up to that initial device, as the Galaxy maker chose penny-pinching conservatism over a truly exciting product. Samsung has recently released the Galaxy S25 FE (), and I’ve spent just over two weeks with it. The good news is that the company is stepping up its game with a couple of long-overdue upgrades. But is this enough to make the phone worth buying? Let’s dive into our Galaxy S25 FE review.",

Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

That’s down 92% compared to the album’s modern-era-record debut with 4.002 million units a week ago. Showgirl ’s second week is the fifth-largest week of 2025 for any album. Further, it’s the largest second week for any album since Swift’s last project, The Tortured Poets Department , earned 439,000 in its sophomore frame (May 11, 2024, chart). Showgirl is only the third album to spend its first two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2025, following Morgan Wallen ’s I’m the Problem (its first eight) and Playboi Carti ’s MUSIC (two). Showgirl leads a sleepy top 10 on the latest Billboard 200, where no albums debut in the region. Within the top 10, Olivia Dean ’s The Art of Loving hits a new peak, rising 7-6 in its third week on the chart.

The audience immediately understood the significance of that single word, going wild as Lorde’s hand was projected on screen and the familiar hook of “Girl, So Confusing” began to play alongside teaser shots of Charli.

To counter that, Google made its own version of SharePlay (I don’t blame you if you’ve never heard of it), but it leaves you wanting more — much more.

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

The update will roll out in batches, bringing the 2021 phone in line with its successors. Fairphone 4 owners have waited a long time for their next big software update, and in return for that patience, they’re getting more than they expected. The company has confirmed that it’s skipping Android 14 entirely and going straight to Android 15 , with the rollout planned for early November. The announcement comes from a Fairphone employee on the company’s Community Forum , who said development has “sped up” enough to make the jump possible. The update will roll out in batches, so don’t worry if it doesn’t appear on your phone right away.",

We’ve seen a lot of One UI 8.5 in recent weeks, stemming from leaked builds that have made their way out ahead of an official beta reportedly starting before the end of the year . Early this morning, a splashy new lock screen media animation from an in-progress One UI 8.5 build surfaced on Twitter. A video shared by Tarun Vats on Twitter demonstrates the new effect on a phone running One UI 8.5. When tapping to skip forward or back, large album art fades from one album to the next, along with a sort of wipe effect that expands from one or two seemingly random spots within the frame.",

Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance.

    "body": "Credit: Realme TL;DR Realme just teased a key design element for the upcoming GT 8 Pro flagship. Its camera island can be swapped out for a different shape or color. The phone also features special color tuning by camera brand Ricoh and is realme’s first phone with a special partnership. Innovation is dead, one could easily argue in the context of phone designs. In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears. OnePlus’ sister brand, realme, has just begun teasing its upcoming flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 . In addition to the new chipset, the realme GT 8 Pro is also the brand’s first phone to feature a camera developed in partnership with a ca…",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfZRRrBe9Qk This week, we’ve spent some hands-on time with the upcoming OPPO Find X9 Pro flagship. It won’t be long until we can share our full initial impressions, but we can talk a bit about the new camera setup, and it’s certainly shaping up to be impressive. That’s not particularly surprising. I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length. Paired with crops and upscaling from that huge 200MP camera, it can take photos all the way out to 40x (920mm).",

    "body": "I’m not quite ready to draw my conclusions on the iPhone 17 Pro just yet — essentially, whether it can finally pull me away from Android — but I do know one thing: Apple is taking its still photography more seriously than ever. It’s added new Photographic Styles to the mix, reworked the camera app to give it a more straightforward interface, and finally upgraded its camera hardware with a significantly improved 4x telephoto sensor . Unsurprisingly, it has me reaching for the iPhone camera more than ever before, and it’s making me wonder whether the Pixel 10 Pro really has my favorite camera system. So, to settle things once and for all, I decided to put the two giants to the test. I set out to grab a series of snaps across some of the most common focal lengths to see if I really still liked Google’s processing the best. Here’s what I found.",

Hotel Wi-Fi isn’t always reliable, and local SIM cards may be difficult to find or incompatible with your phone. Travel-friendly eSIMs have made these concerns a thing of the past.
