His death was confirmed Tuesday on the group’s official Facebook page. Skyhooks archivist Peter Green announced the news, writing that Starkie “passed away early this morning” after spending the past year undergoing treatment while still hoping to return to the stage. Green remembered him as the youngest member of the band who “embraced the theatrics” that became a signature part of Skyhooks’ identity — from bold makeup and elaborate stage outfits to the irreverent swagger that helped define the group’s rise. “The music always came first,” Green wrote, adding that performing live “was his absolute joy” and that “music was in his blood till the very end.” Starkie joined Skyhooks in August 1973, replacing his older brother Peter Starkie, who died in 2020 at age 72 following complications from a fall. Peter was one of the musicians who helped establish the early lineup that would go on to dominate Australian rock in the mid-1970s. In a tribute shared through the band’s page , Starkie’s daughter Indiana said her father “peacefully depa…",
