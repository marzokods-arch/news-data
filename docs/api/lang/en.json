On Saturday (Sept. 27), the 32-year-old country superstar took to social media to build hype for the upcoming live-action trailer of the latest installment in the popular first-person shooter franchise, set for release on Oct. 10 through Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios. In the 12-second clip shared to Instagram , Wallen appears in a war-torn setting, sporting a backward baseball cap and a green long-sleeve shirt while wielding an intimidatingly large automatic rifle. &#8220;For the bad guys out there,&#8221; Wallen says as he cocks his weapon. &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m the problem.&#8221; The line is a direct nod to Wallen’s latest album, I’m the Problem , which spent 12 nonconsecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 following its release in May 2025. The teaser ends with a message revealing that the full live-action trailer for Battlefield 6 will drop Sunday (Sept. 28). Wallen isn&#8217;t the only celebrity joining the Battlefield 6 campaign.

This marks the first concert at Sanford Stadium in more than a decade.
