As someone who has been a thin-phone skeptic, I’ve looked at the iPhone Air’s launch with the same disdain I reserved for the Galaxy S25 Edge : Why would anyone trade off crucial features like battery life and camera versatility for a flagship whose primary claim-to-fame is that it’s thin? After using the iPhone Air for about a day, I get it. I see why thin phones are hyped, though there’s still a long way to go before they become the default recommendation.

Others, like OnePlus, have begun closed beta programs, though details about its wider rollout remain scant. Nothing may be following soon, and has now announced some more details about its upcoming closed beta program for the Nothing OS 4.0 based on Android 16.

I bring it along on road trips and plug it into my accommodation’s TV. This saves me from whipping out my laptop or logging into my accounts on a stranger’s TV, and also gives me far more control over the content I have access to.

Google’s working on a slightly tweaked workflow for alarm creation, making date options more prominent. Alarms that fail to go off as scheduled should start displaying a slightly more helpful error notification. Sometimes, it’s the simplest things in the world that end up causing our most unexpected headaches. Google’s Clock app is about as straightforward as they come: it tells the time, lets you set alarms, and can run a stopwatch or a timer. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a recent update addressed our lack of imagination there, as users found the time rendered in unexpected ways, impairing visibility. Thankfully, it looks like some fixes are already arriving.

The manufacturer has beaten several other major brands to the punch with this move. This also comes months after Sony finally offered a more respectable update policy for its flagship phones. Sony doesn’t have the best reputation for software updates, as it has long offered terrible update policies for its phones. That changed with the Xperia 1 VII earlier this year, and now there’s more good news. The 2025 flagship has just received the stable Android 16 update. Redditors reported that their Xperia 1 VII phones were indeed getting the stable Android 16 update. The update is roughly 1.1GB and has version number 71.1.A.2.68. It doesn’t seem like Sony is offering a changelog, though.",

Instead of the expected Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra lineup, we found evidence that Samsung’s 2026 Galaxy S family may consist of the Galaxy S26 Pro, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra. The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung. Where the base model Galaxy S has long felt overlooked and underpowered, the new “Pro” moniker led me to believe that the Galaxy S26 Pro could be the true compact flagship phone I’ve wanted from Samsung for so long.",

The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker.

    "body": "TL;DR Google appears to be backing down from its long-standing position against letting Pixel phones record voice calls. The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

And now, this smart projector is going on sale. The first Roku TV smart projector is developed in collaboration with Aurzen, a brand known for its portable and compact smart projectors . The newly launched Aurzen Roku TV Smart Projector D1R Cube is slated to offer similar functionality, but with the advantage of a familiar interface baked into the product. With that, you will also be able to access more than 500 free live TV channels that Roku offers across devices.",

Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed.

Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 .

The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

Pixels are among the best Android phones you can buy, but they have also earned a notorious reputation for battery troubles.

Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk, including the potential for explosion or fire,” a user noted on Google’s support forums . The thread now has several complaints from other Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users who are also experiencing battery swelling issues on their devices.",
