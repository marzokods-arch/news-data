    "body": "Kenshi Yonezu’s “IRIS OUT” returns to No. 1 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 , on the chart released Dec. 24. The Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc theme rebounds to the summit for the first time in two weeks, marking its 11th total week at No. 1. Week over week, downloads rise to 114%, streaming to 102%, and video views to 101%. The track also holds No. 1 for a 13th consecutive week on the Global Japan Songs Excl. Japan chart dated Dec. 18. While its combined video and audio streams outside Japan total 9.86 million, falling short of 10 million, it nonetheless maintains the top spot. Debuting at No. 2 is “Are wa Fairy,” the title track of Bokuga Mitakatta Aozora’s seventh single. The CD launched with 120,035 copies to take No. 2 for sales and comes in at No. 3 for radio. Panda Dragon’s “Winter Song Boeitai” bows at No. 3. The title track of the five-member boy band&#8217;s 13th single leads sales with 131,384 copies, but places third on the Japan Hot 100 this week due to a lack of support from other metrics. Also making its first appearance on the chart at No. 4 is OCTPATH’s “Starlight Rendezvous.” The title track of the group’s eighth single sold 85,717 copies to take No. 3 for th…",

A bulk container installed in the MSG, filled with viscous fluid and embedded particles, is subjected to oscillating frequencies to observe how the particles cluster and form larger structures in microgravity. Insights from this research may advance fire suppression, lunar dust mitigation, and plant growth in space. On Earth, the findings could inform our understanding of pollen dispersion, algae blooms, plastic pollution, and sea salt transport during storms. In addition to uncovering potential benefits on Earth, research done aboard the space station helps inform long-duration missions like Artemis and future human expeditions to Mars.

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",
