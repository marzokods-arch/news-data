The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

It appears that the Galaxy S26 Ultra has the necessary flag to install this app. This suggests that the Galaxy S26 series could get the Pixel’s Scam Detection powers. If there’s one reason to buy a Pixel phone, it’s to take advantage of its Scam Detection feature. Just as the name suggests, the feature is designed to detect scams and notify the user. Last week, we discovered evidence that suggests this feature may not stay a Pixel exclusive for long. Now, even more evidence has emerged, and it suggests the Galaxy S26 Ultra could be one of the first non-Pixel Android phones to get Scam Detection.

But if you’re not most people, you can buy the Galaxy Z TriFold starting today, January 30, at 10 AM Eastern Time. The Galaxy Z TriFold won’t be sold by any third-party sellers, such as Amazon or Walmart, or through carriers for now. It is available exclusively via Samsung’s own channels, and you can buy it on its online store . If you want to try the TriFold before buying it, you can do that through one of the company’s various Experience Stores in California, Texas, New York, and Minnesota. You can find details about those here .",

I’ve been putting these tools through their paces on my laptop, and while some of them feel like a genuine win, others left me scratching my head — or just waiting for the progress bar to move. A quick heads-up, though: Many of these features are currently in early access. They are primarily available to those with Google One AI Pro or AI Ultra subscriptions, and for now, you’ll need to be in the US and set your browser to English to give them a whirl.",

Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings.

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).

There’s no denying that generative AI can produce some impressive results, and while it’s easy to see that success and imagine some even grander possibilities, actually distilling all that promise down into an easy-to-use, reliable tool can prove particularly challenging.

Support was previously removed to distance the project from game piracy. The removal prompted forks that restored support, causing confusion for users. Azahar provided a light at the end of the tunnel after the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra was caught in the crossfire of Nintendo’s legal actions against Yuzu, but there was always one major complaint. A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

Google has agreed to pay $135 million to settle a class action suit over “appropriating” Android users’ mobile data. The suit accused Google of harvesting Android user data over cellular connections without their consent, including at times when Google’s apps were closed on those users’ devices. As reported by Reuters , a preliminary settlement was filed Tuesday night and is pending approval from a judge.

The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",
