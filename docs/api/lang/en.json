In July, CEO Daniel Ek said he was “unhappy” with the company’s advertising business, and executives laid out their efforts to turn it around. Some changes would be technical, such as giving brands the ability to buy programmatic ads through platforms such as The Trade Desk. The move to allow free streamers to choose their songs rather than listen on shuffle mode was more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with free, ad-supported music isn’t confined to Spotify, though. Around the world, streaming revenue from audio and video supported by advertising fell sharply in the first half of the year. In the U.S., free streaming — both audio and video — from on-demand and social platforms fell 2.9% to $875 million, worse than the 1.8% decline in all of 2024.

Soon, Nexstar, the largest U.S. owner of TV stations, announced that it would preempt Kimmel’s show — followed by ABC itself.&nbsp; The practical lesson here is not only that the Trump administration is trying to exert more control over the media, it’s that it has more tools to do so than most people realize.

At the time, when Psyche was about 143 million miles (230 million kilometers) from Earth. Managed by JPL, DSOC successfully demonstrated that data encoded in laser photons could be reliably transmitted, received, and then decoded after traveling millions of miles from Earth out to Mars distances. Nearly two years after launching aboard the agency’s Psyche mission in 2023, the demonstration completed its 65th and final “pass” on Sept. 2, 2025, sending a laser signal to Psyche and receiving the return signal from 218 million miles (350 million kilometers) away.

Along the way, a partnership between NASA wind tunnel engineers, data visualization scientists, and software developers verified a quick, cost-effective solution to improve NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for the upcoming Artemis II mission. This will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, on an approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. &nbsp; A high-speed network connection between high-end computing resources at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility and the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel , both located at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California&#8217;s Silicon Valley, is enabling a collaboration to improve the rocket for the Artemis II mission. During the Artemis I test flight, the SLS rocket experienced higher-than-expected vibrations near the solid rocket booster attach points, caused by unsteady airflow between the gap. One solution proposed for Artemis II was adding four strakes. A strake is a thin, fin-like structure commonly us…",

This network enhances the quality of life for the whole country and facilitates business interactions within and globally, boosting productivity and prosperity. However, the industry faces numerous challenges, particularly the need to reduce rising operational costs in a growing market to accommodate increased demand in air travel, e-commerce, and cargo sectors. Issues such as aging aircraft and components, technological advancements, and staffing shortages further complicate these challenges, hindering efforts to balance passenger safety with operational efficiency. To address these challenges, the industry needs to swiftly innovate and implement more efficient and resilient aircraft maintenance practices, including the adoption of new technologies.

A new NASA mission will capture images of Earth’s invisible “halo,” the faint light given off by our planet’s outermost atmospheric layer, the exosphere, as it morphs and changes in response to the Sun. Understanding the physics of the exosphere is a key step toward forecasting dangerous conditions in near-Earth space, a requirement for protecting Artemis astronauts traveling through the region on the way to the Moon or on future trips to Mars. The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory will launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 23. Revealing Earth’s invisible edge In the early 1970s, scientists could only speculate about how far Earth’s atmosphere extended into space. The mystery was rooted in the exosphere, our atmosphere’s outermost layer, which begins some 300 miles up. Theorists conceived of it as a cloud of hydrogen atoms — the lightest element in existence — that had risen so high the atoms were actively escaping into space. But the exosphere reveals itself only via a faint “halo” of ultraviolet light known as the geocorona. Pioneeri…",
