Although this will still be an early access, I can’t wait to get my proverbial hands on it because I’m sick of Google Assistant’s glitches . The inconsistency, frequent bugs, and silly downgrades have taken the joy out of using a “smart” speaker, to a point where I find myself arguing with it more often than using it. Gemini, however, has been a lot more interesting to use on my Pixel phones and watches, and I can’t help but think that this will be a huge upgrade for everyone. Here’s why.",

Midnight came and went without the suddenly highly anticipated release, but just around 3:30 a.m. ET, the set appeared on YouTube, trickling to other DSPs shortly after. Swag II was now officially with us. The 23-track set follows in the organic-sounding, warm-feeling alt-R&amp;B mode of the first Swag , with many of the same sonic architects (Dijon, Carter Lang, Mk.gee), and even a couple overlapping feature guests in Lil B and Eddie Benjamin. New to the Swag is Afrobeats star Tems, British singer-songwriter Bakar and &#8217;00s Louisiana rapper Hurricane Chris.

This bug is technically different, but the end result is the same. Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency.

Confirmed today, Sept. 5, the “Dance Monkey” star is the halftime entertainment for the Friday spectacle, and she’ll headline a “Fan Night” the following evening. Tones (real name Toni Wilson) is a regular courtside guest for Melbourne United home games, and is a passionate fan of the sport.

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025. Most e-readers stick to the basics: an E-Ink screen, a bookstore tie-in, and enough battery to survive a long vacation. At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an “AI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.” This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed. On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn’t shared an actual usage estimate.",

Google’s Connected Cameras feature is handy for turning another Pixel phone or GoPro into a remote camera for livestreams.

A Pixel 8 Pro owner on Reddit says they’re now seeing the Connected Cameras toggle in their settings, and they’re not alone. In Telegram groups, others report the same on the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7 beta builds.

This afternoon at IFA 2025, the company introduced the Horizon 20 Series, its most luminous projectors yet, featuring Google TV. With this launch, XGIMI sets its sights squarely on home theater heavyweights like Epson and BenQ. The Horizon 20 Series comes in three variants, the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max, but it’s the Max that steals the spotlight. With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room. That puts it ahead of most portable Google TV projectors and even in the same conversation as mid-range home units from brands like Epson.",

But this evolution comes with a new concern: over-saturation. There are now well over a dozen reputable prepaid carriers, along with a seemingly endless wave of smaller providers. In 2025 alone, at least five new mobile services have either been announced or even launched already, including Klarna Mobile , SmartLess Mobile, Trump Mobile , Gerald BNPL Mobile, and an upcoming service from MrBeast .

That is the most significant pain point that Dymesty addresses with its AI Glasses.

However, it also fleshes out the different configurations. You’ll be able to pick from models with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at the entry level, right up to an Ultra version with a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.
