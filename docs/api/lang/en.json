    "body": "TL;DR Google is updating its Androidify app with Wear OS support, letting users create custom watch faces with their personalized Android Bot. The new feature lets you select a watch face design and send your custom bot directly to your connected smartwatch from the phone app. This functionality requires Wear OS 6 because it uses a new API, and while it works, it has not officially rolled out to users yet. Earlier this month, Google brought its Androidify app back from the grave. The company updated the app to leverage its latest AI models to create a fully personalized Android Bot from a photo or text prompt. The result is amazing, making the new Androidify app a great tool for generating social media avatars , especially for Android fans. While it’s easy to set your custom Android Bot as your wallpaper, banner, or avatar, setting it as your watch face is not so straightforward. Most watch faces don’t support custom images, preventing you from showing off your personalized bot. Fortunately, Google is working on an update to the Androidify app that will introduce several watch faces designed to place your Android Bot front and center on your smartwatch.",

Apple has informed affected customers that they will receive the remaining balance via billing once their device trade-in is complete. T-Mobile offers up to $1,100 off when trading in devices for the new iPhone 17 series. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, and it’s got a few Android users tempted to make the switch . For those looking to trade-in their Android phone for the iPhone 17, doing it through a carrier like T-Mobile makes sense as you can score a sweet deal, with up to $1,100 off on some plans. Many users have jumped at the opportunity, but something was amiss, and they did not get full promo credit from T-Mobile on their iPhone 17 pre-order. Thankfully, it seems T-Mobile and Apple are already rectifying the situation, assuring users that they will soon receive their balance credit. Reddit user NoT-RexFatalities and several others received an email from Apple informing them that their recent iPhone 17 pre-order through T-Mobile qualifies for $800 in total credits.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding a long-awaited option to Pixel phones that lets users reverse the order of the three-button navigation bar. This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones. We discovered evidence for the new setting in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, but the setting isn’t live yet. For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation. Fortunately, Google is finally adding an option to reverse the buttons in the navigation bar. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

The redesigned Setup Wizard includes thicker buttons and a cleaner card-like UI on certain screens. Most users are likely to miss the changes as the Setup Wizard only appears on new or wiped devices, but a refresh was much needed to make a strong first impression. Google recently rolled out Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 for supported Pixel phones, packing in many key changes , such as icon shape customization, step tracking in Health Connect, protection from SMS OTP hijacking, and more. If you are installing the update on an existing device, you’d have likely missed that the Setup Wizard has also gotten a Material 3 Expressive upgrade with this Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 release.

This mistake cost me $70, so let my story be a cautionary tale for you: You shouldn’t buy this charger for your Pixel 10 Pro XL. It’s a basic wireless charger that, yes, can go up to 25W wirelessly, but does so at the expense of terrible heat dissipation. And it doesn’t offer anything special that other Qi2 25W chargers can’t do — as a matter of fact, it does less.",

Google Maps isn’t the ideal road trip companion for all intents and purposes. Sure, it gets you from A to B (eventually), estimates travel time, and provides turn-by-turn directions, but that’s the bare minimum I’d expect from any long-distance navigation tool. It offers the basics and stops there. With a few tweaks and additions, Maps could become a more effective planning, navigating, and discovery tool for road adventurers.",

Samsung finally pushed out the stable version of its One UI 8 software to the Galaxy S25 series on Monday. Unfortunately, this release was initially restricted to Korea. Thankfully, there’s good news for some global users. Galaxy S25 series owners in Europe report (via Reddit and Twitter ) that the stable One UI 8 update is now available for them. Based on these reports, the update is currently rolling out in countries like France, Georgia, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, and the UK. Some users have also confirmed that they weren’t enrolled in the beta program but still received the update. Either way, it seems like a broad rollout across Europe.",

The company announced the change today, and a new banner and “Devices” page within the app now explicitly state Health Connect will track your phone’s steps for other apps to use. This marks a significant shift for the platform, turning it from a simple data hub into a fitness tracking service. Last week, we reported that Google was bringing native step tracking to Health Connect , allowing the app to count your steps using your phone’s sensors. This marks a significant shift for the app, which currently doesn’t track any data on its own and instead acts as a hub for information from other health and fitness services. While that was its original purpose, it seems Google has bigger plans for the platform . This change suggests Health Connect could transform from a simple data hub into a full-fledged tracking platform, with native step counting being just the first step. When we first reported on this feature, though, we noted some uncertainty. Our evidence came from an analysis of the APK in the 2508 Android Canary release , but the feature itself wasn’t functional yet,…",

Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 8, based on Android 16, to the Galaxy S25 series . But Samsung isn’t the only brand rolling out the new Android OS to its devices this week. Motorola is also getting the ball rolling with a couple of its handsets. The stable version of Android 16 is starting to arrive on some Motorola phones. The first devices getting the software are the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (via YTECHB ) and the Edge 50 Fusion (via Gizmochina ). On top of that, it seems the release is only happening in specific markets at the moment, which include Brazil for the Edge 60 Pro and Mexico for the Edge 50 Fusion.

The manufacturer also confirms specs, which are almost perfectly in line with those of the RG Slide. Smartphones may be our bread and butter, but we are absolute suckers around here for a nice handheld gaming console — so we were understandably very excited earlier this month when we got word about the ANBERNIC RG 476H on the way. At the time we made some inferences about the hardware we were likely to get, and it sure felt like this model could be shaping up to be a budget-friendly alternative to some of its peers. Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

No trade-in is required, but there are some important restrictions to be aware of. You want a brand-new phone, and you’d rather not pay the manufacturer’s full launch price, so what’s a savvy shopper to do? If you’re like a lot of us, you’re always looking around for the best phone trade-in deals, maximizing the value you can get for your old phone while upgrading to a new one. But what if you’re still a big fan of that old phone, and would rather not get rid of it? Normally that would disqualify you from anything resembling a trade-in offer, but this week we’re looking at a promotion that’s shaped a bit like a trade-in, but functions more like a loyalty program, capable of saving you hundreds of dollars off a Nothing Phone 3 .",

Google’s Clock app is about as straightforward as they come: it tells the time, lets you set alarms, and can run a stopwatch or a timer. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a recent update addressed our lack of imagination there, as users found the time rendered in unexpected ways, impairing visibility. Thankfully, it looks like some fixes are already arriving.

Redditors reported that their Xperia 1 VII phones were indeed getting the stable Android 16 update. The update is roughly 1.1GB and has version number 71.1.A.2.68.

The idea that Samsung would eliminate the Galaxy S26 and replace it with the Galaxy S26 Pro was the biggest takeaway in my book, as it would open a big opportunity for Samsung. Where the base model Galaxy S has long felt overlooked and underpowered, the new “Pro” moniker led me to believe that the Galaxy S26 Pro could be the true compact flagship phone I’ve wanted from Samsung for so long.",

The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker. Fortunately, Google is now rolling out an update to the Photo Picker that introduces some much-needed quality-of-life improvements.

    "body": "TL;DR Google appears to be backing down from its long-standing position against letting Pixel phones record voice calls. The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

The good news, as it were, is that the iPhone 17 series claims “up to 50% charge in 20 minutes ” with Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter.

Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

In 2022, the social media giant agreed to pay a $725 million settlement to those affected. Fast forward to today, those payments are finally starting to find their way to claimants’ accounts. Anyone who was a Facebook user between May 7, 2007, and December 22, 2022, and filed a claim for this class action settlement will soon be getting a paycheck. The company handling the payments has confirmed that distribution has commenced. If you registered your claim, you should receive an email notification three to four days before your payment is issued.",

    "summary": "To distribute on Google Play, developers must allow users to modify their app's icon",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is making support for its Themed Icons feature mandatory by automatically generating themed icons for apps that don’t already provide one. This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

A nice digital projector is a fantastic way to add some size and spectacle to your next movie night, and while there are some utterly fantastic options available out there, there are also lots of underpowered solutions that might save you some money upfront, but are just also hampered by compromise after compromise. We love saving money as much as the next guy, though, so we’re always looking for opportunities to save big on the kind of projector hardware that won’t leave you full of regrets — and if you’re willing to act fast, we just might have one for you. Earlier this summer we were telling you about the launch of the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro , a 4K laser projector running Google TV. The interface is already a big win right there, and that bright laser light source give it 2000 ISO lumens output, meaning you’re actually going to be able to see things, even during the day.",

Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out.
