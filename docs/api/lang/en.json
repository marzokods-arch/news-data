    "body": "TL;DR Google broke the Pixel IMS app that enabled VoLTE/VoWiFi on unsupported carriers, but the developer has already released a new workaround. Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

When you’re looking to tweak a picture you just took, Google Photos offers some quick and easy tools for making common adjustments.

If you’ve been using the service for long, it’s likely your image library has gotten a little hairy by now — juggling hundreds or thousands of images across years of albums can be a pain. We’ve recently spotted an upcoming change that might make it just a little easier. Tinkering with version 7.49 of the Google Photos app, we managed to enable a new chip that shows up when viewing a photo that you’ve added to any albums.

Vivo has confirmed that the phones will be available globally, along with the external lens accessory. We thought the vivo X200 Pro was one of the best camera phones of the year. That’s largely due to fantastic long-range zoom and plenty of video options. Now, the company has announced the vivo X300 series, including the X300 Pro. The series consists of the standard X300 and the X300 Pro, and both devices have a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chipset, IP69 ratings, and OriginOS 6 atop Android 16 . The two phones also sport a minimum display brightness of just one nit. Both devices also opt for an iPhone-style design with more rounded corners and a flat metal frame, much like the OPPO Find X8 series last year.",

This virtue has allowed Android to drive the resurgence of various ignored or abandoned form factors, such as decade-old Blackberrys . For Nintendo DS and 3DS fans specifically, it has led to the emergence of Android gaming handhelds armed with not one but two screens . After products from noted portable console makers, including AYANEO and AYN , another manufacturer — ANBERNIC — is throwing its hat into the ring with a new dual-screen handheld.

The update is available for Watch 7 users who had previously enrolled in the One UI 8 Watch beta. A wider rollout for users outside the beta circle and in other regions is expected to arrive soon. The recently launched Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 was the first to taste Wear OS 6 — even before any Pixel Watch model did . In addition to the latest Galaxy Watch 8 series, stable Wear OS 6 is now heading to the older model — the Galaxy Watch 7 — with the upgrade to One UI 8. Besides blessing the Galaxy Watch 8 and Ultra (2025) at launch, Samsung has also been testing One UI 8 Watch on older Galaxy Watch generations. Of these, the Watch 7 is stepping out of beta after more than three months and receiving a stable update. SamMobile noted that One UI 8 Watch has begun to dribble out for the Galaxy Watch 7 in Korea.",

Whether it’s the Snapdragon 8 Elite’s huge CPU performance leap, the continued rise of silicon-carbon batteries, durability improvements, or slick camera hardware, there were several notable trends in this generation. Technology waits for no one, though, and next-generation smartphone processors have already been revealed. We’ve even seen the first next-generation high-end phones in the Xiaomi 17 series . With all that in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to look at the features you should expect in 2026’s flagship Android phones.",

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions. The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi. VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the feature that routes voice calls over a 4G LTE connection, a crucial function now that carriers worldwide are phasing out their 2G and 3G networks.

This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there.

However, if there’s one product that has reshaped my views, it is NotebookLM, which has truly transformed how I consume information, for reasons other than the fact that it takes excessive prompt engineering out of the question. I have offloaded the unexciting aspects of learning to NotebookLM . That includes boring marketing or business newsletters, research papers, and video essays that I want to imbibe the best of, but without watching the idle chatter that those presenters engage in before getting to the point.

Available for $20 per month (or included for free, if you’re a Prime subscriber), Alexa Plus injects extra AI functionality into your Amazon devices, like the ability to engage in more natural conversation-style interactions with Alexa through an Echo device. Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables.

Moving an eSIM from an iPhone to a Samsung one currently requires contacting your carrier. A One UI 8.5 beta is expected to kick off in November. Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

All P6 Pro variants feature a hybrid SIM/microSD slot with 5G data.

After some details surfaced earlier this week, the company officially launched two versions of the new BOOX P6 Pro in China: a traditional black-and-white model and a splashier Kaleido 3 color variant, both featuring built-in SIM support for 5G connectivity. The Pro series marks a major leap for the lineup. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The duo interacts with Gemini in the car like one would with Gemini Live on their phones. The tech will arrive in the US before the end of the year, and the new Mercedes CLA will be the first production car to feature it. Just yesterday, we got an early look at Gemini inside Google Maps , and now, Google and Mercedes-Benz are giving us a first glimpse at how Gemini will soon be built directly into cars.
