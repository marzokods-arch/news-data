    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR A Finnish retail leak has apparently revealed colors and storage models for the Samsung Galaxy S26 series. The listing corroborates a previous claim that the cheapest Galaxy S26 will now offer 256GB of storage instead of 128GB. This would be a long-overdue move as most of Samsung’s rivals have offered 256GB of base storage for years now. Samsung is one of the few manufacturers still offering flagship Android phones with 128GB of storage, as seen on the base Galaxy S25. However, a new retail leak has revealed some good news for the Galaxy S26. SuomiMobiili reports (h/t: SammyGuru ) that an unnamed Finnish retailer has posted color and storage details for the Samsung Galaxy S26 range . The base Galaxy S26 will apparently be available in 256GB and 512GB flavors.",

In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande .

Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

The U.S. rock veterans played a sold-out marathon set at UTAS Stadium in Launceston on Saturday (Jan. 24), marking their first Tasmanian performance in more than a decade and their debut concert in the state’s second-largest city. The show, which ran close to three hours, was the band’s only Australian date on the current visit. Late in the set, Grohl addressed the crowd with a major update on the band’s next chapter, confirming that Foo Fighters have recently completed work on a new record. “We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023’s But Here We Are is complete. Grohl also hinted strongly that fans won’t have to wait long to see the band back on Australian soil. “This won’t be the last time you see us,” he said. “We’ll be back here sooner than you think… and it’s before my next birthday.” Grohl’s birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia befor…",

I was once an avid SwiftKey user, opting for the innovative keyboard early in my Android journey over Google’s simpler default option. The allure of the more efficient and sensibly designed Google alternative eventually drew me away as I upgraded to more polished devices.

I use Notion and have spent way too much time just setting up my system within the app, choosing the correct icons, and making sure the colors match across my pages. Because I spent so much time tweaking it, I feel like I have to put it to use, so I try to write down as much as humanly possible to achieve that feeling of being on top of things that matter.

Is there any one component of mobile tech that’s responsible for more anxiety than batteries? When we aren’t worried about the batteries in our phones catching fire , we’re worried about them losing capacity over time . At the very least, we’d love it if they accurately communicated their capacity to us, letting us know exactly what we can expect from them. Even that might be too big of an ask, though, and that issue is now core to a class-action settlement that could net Belkin customers a few bucks.

Aggregated trending topic stories are presented very similarly to normal news stories, which may lead readers to blame publishers for misleading or confusing titles. Been seeing bizarre, AI-generated headlines in Google Discover? That’s not an accident, Google says. Following an initial experiment last year , the company has confirmed that it plans to continue using AI to whip up titles for certain stories that appear in the Discover feed that lives on Android home screens, without input from the people who write those stories or much attention paid to whether the generated headlines make any sense. As The Verge ‘s Sean Hollister writes, Google has informed the publication that it will continue slapping AI-generated headlines on certain stories in Discover, a decision that, Google says, has been good for “user satisfaction.”",

These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Evidence from Hyper OS suggests Xiaomi is developing its first item tracker, the Xiaomi Tag. The Xiaomi Tag will likely use a CR2032 battery and may come in two versions, including one with Ultra-Wideband (UWB). A global launch is not yet confirmed, but if it pans out, it could potentially democratize Bluetooth trackers and significantly boost Android’s Find Hub network. We’ve seen a handful of Android-compatible Bluetooth trackers released over the years, but the market is largely untapped, if Apple’s success with AirTags is any indication. Motorola recently announced its Moto Tag 2 tracker, but there’s still plenty of space in the market for other Android brands to launch their offerings. It seems Xiaomi has decided to finally enter this space, as a new leak shows off the upcoming Xiaomi Tag. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Between the great hardware, clean software out of the box, and a price tag that skirted well below other flagships, it was the safe recommendation. However, more than that, a OnePlus smartphone has traditionally been a smartphone that was, more or less, fully under your control. If the phone was out of the software update guarantee period, you could install a custom ROM to breathe new life into it. If you didn’t like a software update, you could revert to the previous version. Or, if you just wanted to tinker around with hardware you owned, you could. Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

The idea is simple — Now Brief looks at calendar events with a tagged location, checks where you are, and then works out when you should leave to get there on time.

Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud.

It’s launched one or two each of the last few years, sometimes under its own umbrella and sometimes licensed through CE Brands (now Vitalist Inc.). And yet, you might not have realized it’s done anything in the wearable space since it tried to reboot the Moto 360 several years ago. That’s how forgettable the Moto Watch experience has been. Somehow, though, I’ve always held out hope that something good was on its way. Until now. With yet another Motorola wearable on the horizon, I’ve decided it’s finally time to give up. I don’t think the Moto Watch will ever figure out its true identity, and I think it’s time we all moved on. Here’s why.",

Google was already later than usual when it rolled out the January 2026 update for supported Pixel devices . Perhaps it was a holiday hangover still lingering. But despite the rollout having been initiated over 10 days ago, many Pixel users still don’t have the update. Subreddits dedicated to Pixel phones are rife with users complaining they haven’t received the January update yet. These complaints span across multiple Pixel devices, but we’re seeing the majority of reports for the Pixel 8 and the Pixel 10 series. And these reports are consistent, regardless of whether their devices are unlocked or tied to a carrier. A handful of reports also hint at Pixel 9 or 9a not having received the update either.",

The option will likely be under Settings &gt; Location &amp; Privacy, and accessing it will remove the association between your submitted reports and your account. Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports. That could soon change, as Google Maps v26.04.01 includes code suggesting Google could soon let users delete all their contributed reports across incidents, road conditions, transit, and trip issues.

And while it’s on track to launch as a new device, most people will agree it offers only minor improvements over the Galaxy S25 Ultra.
