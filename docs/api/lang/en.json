I've hauled many discrete GPU-equipped lappys into the office for a spot of real-world testing, and most of them are usually begging to be plugged into a wall socket by lunchtime. Upon hearing Intel's battery life efficiency claims for its new, Panther Lake-based, Core Ultra Series 3 chips, I knew what needed to be done. Top up my Asus Zenbook Duo review sample overnight, take it on my round trip from my Southampton home to PC Gamer Towers in Bath (a roughly 126 mile jaunt), use it for a regular day, and record when it conks out. It's a dGPU-less machine, which means all the graphics hardware is contained onboard the single Core Ultra X9 388H chip at its heart. Despite this, the built-in Arc B390 iGPU delivers some impressive gaming performance for its size, meaning that laptops powered by Intel's new mobile chips (the ones with chonky iGPUs, anyway) can now reasonably be called gaming laptops. Intel says that Core Ultra Series 3 machines can boast up to 27-hour battery life , but my Asus sample is a bit different. It'…",

And maybe the odd handheld eventually, too. The headline news here is the gaming performance, as Intel has supercharged the onboard iGPU of several of its new chips to provide a sizable whack of graphics grunt. I've been testing an Asus Zenbook Duo equipped with the very tippety-top of the lineup, the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H , complete with a 12 Xe3 core-equipped Intel Arc B390 iGPU.

My job, then, is to not only refine Mochi-O into a weapon of war with upgrades and powerups galore, but to care for it and establish a solid bond through feeding it seeds and giving it plenty of pre-battle scritches.

But no, all we got was a single Ryzen 7 9850X3D announcement and no mention whatsoever of the vaunted dual-CCD 3D V-Cache chip. But a new EEC listing from AMD before the weekend has listed a new Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 processor alongside the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and a bunch of Threadripper chips. (Image credit: EEC) To bring you up to speed, 3D V-Cache is AMD's bespoke technology which underlays an extra chunk of L3 cache underneath the processor cores in a Zen 5 CPU package. The benefit of this is that games in particular benefit from all that extra on-die memory, reducing the number of times programs have to dip into slower system memory and therefore boosting frame rates. On chips, such as the Ryzen 9 9800X3D , and the upcoming 9850X3D, that means all eight of the CPU cores get access to a whole lot more cache. But for the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D chips, which have multiple core complex dies (CCD) to accommodate their higher core counts, only one CCD gets the extra cache. With the…",

Thanks to Sydney-based web developer Arin Sarkisian, Doom now runs on a pair of earbuds. More specifically, it runs on the PineBuds Pro , which Sarkisian explains on his site are \"the only earbuds with open source firmware.\" The buds have a CPU strong enough to run Doom with some minor tweaks—the site notes Sarkisian \"cranked [the CPU] up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode,\" providing \"more than enough\" juice to run the game, albeit at around 18 fps. Doom itself also required some tweaking so that the buds' meager RAM could handle the game, but the site explains \"there are plenty of optimisations\" that can cut down on Doom's required 4 MB of RAM.

But he discovered that its cutesy visuals and gentle onboarding belied a game of serious puzzling depth. \"As a puzzle it becomes exponentially tricky. Each asteroid or planet only houses a small number of possible resources, making effective shipping between them vital,\" he wrote in September last year. \"It starts to feel like trying to fit all the components of a circuit board in a functioning layout on the surface of a potato.\" Up to this point, Star Birds' puzzling has been limited to synthetic resource production. Now, though, things are about to get more involved with the addition of organic production chains. Earlier this week, Toukana introduced its Flora & Fauna update to Star Birds, adding alien plants, food production, and a frankly concerning number of tentacles. Much of this revolves around the new star system players can explore. Paradeira is a green and pleasant sector of space bustling with organic life. Primarily, this life can be…",

When I'm in a cramped tunnel full of ghouls with an air-cooled automatic rifle and a depleting supply of .308 rounds, I want to be in claustrophobic first-person. When I'm jogging across the countryside in a duster, or swinging a golf club at Fiends coming from every direction, I want to be in open third-person. Modders have tended to focus on first-person animations, both because it's the more popular view and the easiest to tweak. Which is why it's taken until now for modder Wombat to bless us with a full third-person animation overhaul for Fallout: New Vegas. And yes, it does cover NPCs as well. Enhanced Animations – 3rd Person Movement is apparently the first in a series of planned Enhanced Animation mods.

This is distinct from the irregular preproduction work that came before, as well as the even more blistering, seven days a week schedule he kept during the game's final stretch in 1997. Cain would wake up at 6:00 AM, take care of his cat, then reach the office by 7:00⁠—homemade loaf of bread in hand⁠, recipe helpfully under the video's top comment—to get an early start on coding tasks when there were no meetings to interrupt him.

Before this week's pre-patch, players could create and save outfits, which would apply a sort of 'new skin' over their existing gear. If they got a new piece of gear, it'd pop up in their currently-equipped item, requiring them to visit an NPC to re-apply the transmog over it again.

Pop back every weekend to find out what Jeremy, Josh and Rick have become obsessed with this time, whether it's the canon height of Thief's Garrett or that time someone in the Vatican pirated Football Manager . Before I played No Players Online, I knew nothing about it, except that it was a horror game set in a server for an abandoned multiplayer FPS. In some ways it is exactly that, but in others it is not really that at all. If that description seems confounding, then it is only accurate to my experience with this deeply strange game, which is at once a fairly derivative horror experience and one of the oddest puzzlers I've ever played. Even the history of No Players Online is confusing. I've been vaguely aware of the game for years, but it turns out that the No Players Online I was familiar with is not the No Players Online I just played. The commercial version that launched late last year and costs $15 is based upon a free, short game released back in 2019, developed by Adam Pype with sound design by Viktor Kraus and addit…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. I love a classic videogame dungeon. Give me dark caves and dripping ceilings. Give me puzzle doors and weird keys. Give me traps under every flagstone and monsters in every room. The best dungeons are burned into my brain as some of my favourite levels of all time, lurking forever in the shadows of my memory like a gang of 2d4 skeletons. But how well do you remember your years of excursions in the underworld? Our latest quiz tests exactly that, challenging you to match each ominously titled dungeon to its game of origin. Only the kind of seasoned adventurer who knows their Underearth from their Underdark and their Dredmor from their Deadmines will prevail. It's multiple choice, so even when you're stumped you can at least make a guess—but remember that down in the dark, giving the wrong answer to a riddle can have dire consequences… Let us know how you did in the comments below!",

But a new trailer reveals that The Killing Stone will be ready for business next month, and I'm beginning to think it might be one of the early bangers of 2026. The Killing Stone is a card battler with demonic overtones that owes at least some of its soul to 2021's Inscryption . The meat of the experience is a simulated board-game where you play cards that come to life as little critters. These critters form up in a line on the board, fighting to destroy a lidless eye that represents each player's life. Destroy your opponent's eye and you can move on to the next battle. If your eye gets poked to oblivion on the other hand, well, let's just say the results aren't to your advantage. Surrounding this mechanical core is a narrative meta-layer where you explore the spooky house of an old magus, researching upgrades to improve your chances of beating the game and entreating with its curious denizens. As you can hear in the trailer, the game boasts some hefty voice-acting talent…",

That mod is Marrow , a new campaign for Monolith's deviously difficult and ferociously violent shooter. It's sort of Blood's equivalent of John Romero's Sigil —a continuation of Blood's storyline that concluded with protagonist Caleb slaying his demonic former master Tchernobog. Like Sigil, Marrow restricts itself to Blood's original assets (weapons, enemies etc) to power the experience, focussing instead on using those assets to build large and complex new maps for the game. Episode One of Marrow has been out for a while, releasing back in 2023. Marrow's creator, Nick Palsmier, intended to issue a general release of Chapter 2 as close to the launch of Nightdive's 2025 remaster as he could.

Some of these are fun, quirky spinoffs like Nightmare Kart, while others are more serious efforts to replicate Bloodborne's atmosphere. One of these is side-scrolling soulslike The Last Faith , which aims to do for Bloodborne what Blasphemous did for Catholicism and religious dogma, squeezing out its darkest juices into a 2D, metroidvania-shaped glass.

The reveal has become a case study in how not to announce a game, but what really got people worked up is what Highguard's developer did next: nothing. Highguard is launching on Steam next week, but the studio still hasn't said anything new about it publicly, aside from a tweet today announcing a livestream. Starved for a new trailer to dunk on in the endless competition to win the social media Cynicism Cup, posters have had to settle for generic declarations of Highguard's cookedness.

But Arknights: Endfield, which just came out this week, isn't your typical anime gacha game. For a lot of players, it's actually a surprisingly robust factory builder with some action RPG combat on the side. Rolling for the most powerful characters is only half the game; the rest is building the most efficient material processing plant you can. Now that everyone's realized what kind of game they're actually playing, someone went and built an entire simulator for designing factory blueprints to share with other players. EndfieldTools is currently getting slammed with traffic because it's the best spot for sharing factory blueprints and testing out layouts without having to waste resources in-game. The factory planner is essentially a simplified version of the real thing with tools to simulate how efficient your setup truly is. I haven't made it far enough in the game to understand a lot of what's available, but I can already see how much easier it is to click and place buildings without having to jump through menu…",

I smashed through Fallout 3 in a week and change over Christmas, I'm getting asymptotically close to the end of a New Vegas run I started in November, and I've put a humiliating number of hours (28.2, according to Steam) into Fallout 4 in just the past five days. My cold take: New Vegas is still my favorite entry in the series, including the 2D originals. My hot take: Fallout 4 is a vastly superior game to Fallout 3, and deserves more credit than it gets in RPG snob circles. The writing is much better than you remember, with more interesting quests and characters than Fallout 3⁠. The color, vibrancy, and general art direction look fresh even 10 years on. The gunplay is so much better and more satisfying than the prior 3D Fallouts, and the weapon customization is a genuine advancement over what you see in New Vegas. This is actually the optimal settlement shape. (Image credit: Bethesda) That's not even getting to the settlement building stuff, which Fallou…",

Players loved that tech demo so much the sim quickly rocketed onto Steam's list of top wishlists, where it now sits in slot number 10 alongside big-budget games like Ark 2 and Forza Horizon 6. Well, sharpen your sword and polish your armor, because Half Sword is ready to spill its guts all over early access: it launches Friday, January 30. That's just next week! To celebrate, the developer, aptly named Half Sword Games, released a comically grisly new trailer set to a soundtrack of what I'll call one of the most delightfully unhinged songs ever written for a game in history. Watch and listen for yourself: The trailer begins with some bare-fisted boxing, but that quickly escalates to people's faces being pulverised on the ground or against wooden posts. Then it moves on to combatants wonkily destroying each other's bodies with hammers, axes, and swords. But you've seen stu…",

    "body": "I enjoy a good traced ray, AI-upscaled texture, or 'hallucinated' frame as much as the next person, but I think pixel art remains an important part of any art team's tool kit. Pixel art offers far more than a nostalgic throwback appeal, capable of a level of expression that would give even the most photorealistic polygons a run for their money. So when I stumbled across the Isometric NYC city map project, I was at first properly stoked—and then deeply conflicted. Isometric NYC is the one-man effort of Andy Coenen, attempting to render all of New York City in an isometric pixel art style distinctly reminiscent of the SimCity series . But rather than laboriously building this city pixel-by-pixel, Coenen has instead leveraged multiple AI agents to create this city map. The entire process required much more work than dashing off a handful of prompts, but you are perhaps beginning to understand my sense of conflict. Coenen himself is a software engineer currently conducting AI research at Google DeepMind . He explains that the original idea for Isometric NYC was to use Google's \" Nano Banana to generate a pixel art map from satellite imagery tile-by-tile,\" though Coenen ultimately used…",

That's according to The Verge , which claims that sources have told them staff are using Anthropic's Claude, alongside Copilot, for AI coding tasks (aka vibe coding). Not that they're making the choice subversively; in fact, the software giant has been happy for its staff to try out various AI coding tools, including its own GitHub Copilot, Anthropic's Claude 4, and OpenAI's GPT-5. Apparently, Microsoft started the whole experiment last year , but just in the developer division, resulting in Claude Sonnet 4 being selected as the AI choice for paid users of GitHub Copilot, though the option to use others is still available. The Verge writes that now any staff member involved in 'Experiences + Devices' (i.e. Windows, Bing, 365, Surface, and so on) is being encouraged to experiment with Claude, even if they have no coding experience at all.

Jebs saying Hytale feels very polished is the best compliment we could ever get. He is someone I respect very much, and I know he doesn't talk much publicly about other games, so I appreciate that.
