The past 12 months, however, have seen something of a sea change, with the long-term development of British and Irish talent by labels finally paying its dues: Young and Dean, for example, are a prime example of why faith and patience can embolden artists to reach their full potential.

Luckily for the couple they were taking their lesson at home, because not long into the video Bieber pops back in, this time shirtless, with his underwear on display above his low-riding grey sweats, in a code-violating display that would surely not pass a proper food inspection. The couple appear to be quick studies, though, casually massaging the tuna as they prepare to roll it all up in the nori seaweed wrap.

For the Artemis II test flight, a pair of six-foot-long strakes will be added to the core stage of SLS that will smooth vibrations induced by airflow during ascent. The top simulation is without strakes while the bottom shows the airflow with strakes. The green and yellow colors on the rocket’s surface show how the airflow scrapes against the rocket’s skin. The white and gray areas show changes in air density between the boosters and core stage, with the brightest regions marking shock waves.
