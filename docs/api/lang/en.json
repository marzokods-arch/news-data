A little-known tool in Pro mode — a toggleable zoomed-in viewfinder during manual focusing — enables greater precision with focus peaking visual cues. Pro controls are available on the Pixel Fold, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro series, and Pixel 10 Pro series. Pixel phones pack a great camera setup, even though many would agree that there are even better Android camera phones out there . While Pixels remain great for point-and-shoot use cases, the manual camera mode on the Pixel Pros is a great jumping point for anyone interested in becoming a better photographer. The mode is surprisingly well-equipped, and to this day, people are discovering features that they previously hadn’t noticed. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

One of those is a super compact power bank from Baseus , and the other is this UGREEN 3-in-1 desk charger, which happens to be discounted for Black Friday. It’s down to $44.99 from $59.99 on Amazon . I would pick this charger over Google’s official Pixelsnap Charger with Stand any day, and as a matter of fact, it’s the one charger I’ve decided to keep in my office at all times because of many reasons, the most crucial of which being that it can charge my Pixel 10 Pro XL with its primary Qi2 25W magnetic pad, my Pixel Buds 2a or Pro 2 with a secondary 5W charging pad, and it offers a 5W USB-C port that lets me plug in my Pixel Watch 4’s cable.",

The feature, initially available to Samsung users via the Good Lock module Lockstar, became more widely available with One UI 8 and is set for another upgrade with One UI 8.5 . But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended. For instance, it may not recognize humans or pets and apply shabbily over their faces instead of adapting to the outlines of their heads or bodies.

Despite the OnePlus 15’s global launch earlier this month, folks in the US have been deprived of the opportunity to buy one . The reason for its unavailability, as confirmed by OnePlus at the time of the launch, has been the recent US government shutdown, which ended only on November 12. Now that the ball is rolling again, the OnePlus 15 may finally have a chance at being sold in the US, and recent developments indicate it might happen soon. At the time of the launch, OnePlus had attributed the OnePlus 15’s unavailability in the US to a lack of approval from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission). Thankfully, the certificate, which had been stuck in limbo due to the government shutdown, has finally been released.",

With some, like calories burned during an exercise, it makes sense that the figure’s just an estimate, and we shouldn’t expect it to be precise.

Google’s Nano Banana Pro model , based on the Gemini 3 Pro Image, is one of the best tools available today for generating images. My colleague Mishaal Rahman tried out Nano Banana Pro and walked away impressed . The image model is great for creating and editing images, but you’ll still need to use another app to add annotations manually.

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots. Pixel users can now create a 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspot by going to Se…",

Samsung’s next update may finally address one of the most persistent and overlooked issues with dark mode in recent years: app icons that never adapt to the nighttime theme.

    "body": "TL;DR Android will soon ask if you want to enable Desktop Mode or mirror your screen when connecting to an external display. A new “don’t ask me again” checkbox allows the system to remember your preference for specific monitors. This streamlines the setup process, removing the need to dig through Settings to switch between mirroring and desktop modes. With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , certain Pixel phones gained more flexibility when connected to an external display. Rather than being restricted to simple screen mirroring, they can now project a desktop-like interface via Android’s new Desktop Mode . While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it. Without these peripherals, controlling apps becomes difficult unless your external display has a touchscreen. In these cases, screen mirroring remains the better option, as it allows you to navigate using your phone while viewing content on the big screen.",

Circle Screen isn’t universally available yet. Google’s got a whole bunch of ways to search for stuff on your phone’s screen, from Google Lens to Circle to Search to Gemini. Earlier this year, we saw signs that two of those methods were growing closer together — and now, that project is finally rolling out broadly. Back in May , we got our first glimpse at how Circle to Search-like functionality would play out in Gemini. In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for. The implementation rolling out now saves a step: after calling up Gemini, you just draw a circle around the part of your screen you want to share.",

It also handles hair better thanks to its detangling brush setup, and the base station washes and dries the mop pads with high heat, so you’re not left dealing with damp fibers.

One of them is a circular speaker, which can either rest on a table or be mounted on a wall. The other is a lamp-speaker combo with color shades inspired by soft-serve ice cream. Besides playing audio over Bluetooth, these speakers also support Spotify Tap for easy access to your playlists. In addition to its ease of assembly and affordability, what helps IKEA furniture stand apart from the crowd (of other mass-produced furniture) is its inviting vibe and minimal aesthetic. Gladly, its wares extend beyond what has a few feet and sits on the ground. And one category that IKEA has absolutely crushed is obfuscated, visually stunning wireless speakers. IKEA previously offered Wi-Fi-based speakers in partnership with Sonos under its Symfonisk lineup. Since that has come to an end, IKEA has been exploring its own creations. It has now added two new speaker ranges to its inventory in partnership with Swedish designer Tekla Evelina Severin, who’s popularly known as “Teklan.”",

Webb’s new view of the Red Spider Nebula reveals for the first time the full extent of the nebula’s outstretched lobes, which form the ‘legs’ of the spider. These lobes, shown in blue, are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years. Outflowing gas from the center of the nebula has inflated these massive bubbles over thousands of years. Image credit: ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology)",

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.
