It feels like mobile tech is at an inflection point right now when it comes to all things extended reality (XR). While the idea behind glasses-based augmented reality and mixed reality has been around for years, it’s only recently that the hardware and software powering these solutions have matured to the point where all this actually feels like it might just be commercially viable. As we look forward to what’s next from Google and Android XR , it sounds like Meta’s own XR plans are going a bit sideways. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google Meet can now share your system audio, allowing meeting participants to hear sound from any app or source on your computer. Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage. Now it seems Verizon is making a deal of its own , committing to the use of over 4,400 new towers in the deal. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

That’s why we have rounded up a handful of last-minute tech gift ideas that come in under $100 at current prices and don’t necessarily rely on knowing someone’s exact setup. Several of these are the kind of gifts that still make sense even if the recipient already owns something similar, such as a smart light or a useful accessory they didn’t realize they needed. They’re practical, a little bit fun, and easy to slot into everyday life. And yes, a few of them would also make perfectly reasonable “accidental” gifts to yourself.",

    "body": "For the past couple of years, OnePlus’s “R” series has offered some of the best mid-range Android phones money can buy. The 2024 OnePlus 12R stood out as the best $500 smartphone of last year, while the OnePlus 13R delivered an improved experience across the board, justifying its higher $600 price tag. The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

Homey Self-Hosted Server supports Matter, LAN, and cloud devices by default, with Zigbee and Z-Wave available via an optional Homey Bridge. The software is available worldwide with a free trial, followed by a monthly subscription or a one-time lifetime license. Homey seems to have recognized that there’s a significant overlap between people who like to build out a comprehensive smart home and those who also prefer running their own bespoke setups. With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control. Until now, Homey’s lineup has centered on a combination of cloud-based control and physical hubs, such as Homey Pro. With the Homey Self-Hosted Server, the company is opening up its pla…",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is preparing to update scrolling screenshots so the system automatically deletes the original image after you save the expanded version. This change prevents gallery clutter by removing the redundant initial screenshot once the full scrolling capture is saved or shared. We spotted this quality-of-life improvement in the latest Android Canary build, and it could arrive in the Android 16 QPR3 stable release next March. When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows. Scrolling screenshots are a relatively new addition to Android, introduced back in Android 12 . Since then, Google has barely touched the feature, but it’s finally preparing a small but welcome quality-of-life improvement. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026.

I usually just ignore them until they go away, but when someone with an AT&amp;T logo on their shirt showed up at my door, I decided to answer it just to see how the experience would go. One of my main areas of focus here at Android Authority is cellular service coverage, so I figured it would be nice to have a better idea of what people are up against anymore. And, oh boy, was this an experience.",

Instead of launching the Google app, as it does on other Android devices, tapping the search bar on Pixel phones has traditionally opened a unique search overlay that also enables searching for apps, local files, and contacts, and offers a shortcut to search the web in a relatively modern interface. Unfortunately, if you liked that interface, you’d be disheartened to know it is going away. Instead of the unique interface, Google is replacing it with the search screen we’re used to seeing on other non-Pixel devices.",

With up to $380,000 in total prize funding, NASA’s ORBIT challenges student teams to bring their most forward-thinking concepts to the table, either utilizing NASA intellectual property or conceptualizing their own. Teams are tasked with conducting targeted research, designing early mockups or models, and performing feasibility analyses to refine their ideas. Finalists then advance to a live showcase where they present their work to a panel of expert judges, who evaluate the proposals and select winners based on the teams&#8217; final pitches and responses to questions.

Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network?

The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views.

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

There’s no getting around the fact that you are feeding an immense amount of deeply personal information, from journal entries to sensitive work emails, into a black box owned by trillion-dollar corporations. What could go wrong? Now, there’s no going back from AI, but there are use cases for it where it can work as a productivity multiplier. And that’s why I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of researching local AI . If you’re not familiar with the concept, it’s actually fairly simple. It is entirely possible to run a large language model, the brains behind a tool like ChatGPT, right off your computer or even a phone. Of course, it won’t be as capable or all-knowing as ChatGPT, but depending on your use case, it might still be effective enough.

According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers.

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average.

As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity .

According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co.

Rival T-Mobile’s free line promo does not come with an expiry date, making it a much better deal. T-Mobile’s free line promo is the most well-known promo in the industry, but other carriers also offer free lines from time to time, although they tend to fall short. Verizon is back again with a free line promo, and here’s how you can take advantage of it. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Generic red dots are replaced by emoji-style pins and detailed cards featuring photos, star ratings, and review highlights. The visual overhaul is currently rolling out to English users on both the mobile and desktop versions of Gemini. Google’s Gemini app just got a big update for anything related to location, and it’s making it easier to find places that matter to you. Now, instead of a plain text list with a small map at the bottom, your local search results start with visuals and context inside Gemini . If you’ve ever asked Gemini, “Where’s a good coffee spot nearby?” and had to scroll through lots of text before opening Google Maps , this update aims to fix that. Now, the first thing you see is a map, followed by cards for each place with photos, star ratings, and highlights from reviews, the Gemini team confirmed on X . Android Authority first spotted this feature earlier this month, along with a ChatGPT-inspired redesign to Gemini’s tool menu .",

That friction inadvertently impacts users switching from an Android device to an iPhone or using both OSes at the same time. Now, it appears iOS bugs may also lean into those biases. Several iPhone users noticed an unexplained iOS 26 bug that changes the colors of pictures taken on Android devices and shared with them. Numerous reports on Reddit say that their pictures, when viewed in the iOS Photos app, turn red when they zoom in on the image.
