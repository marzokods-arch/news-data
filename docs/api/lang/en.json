Prior to that, he served in several positions with triple j, the state-funded national youth broadcaster, including breakfast show producer, program director and, later as network head. Despite the recording industry &#8216;s well-reported issues with TikTok, Wards is well-liked in the music business and community, and respected for his artist-first approach, and determination for taking domestic talent to the world.

The End of an Era , a six-part docuseries focused on the biggest tour of the superstar’s career, premiered its first two episodes on Disney+ on Friday (Dec. 12), with further episodes rolling out in the coming weeks. And while The End of an Era could have existed as pure fan service &#8212; and that is certainly an aspect of the opening episodes, with slow-motion shots of an unstoppable Swift and adoring supporters &#8212; the heart of the series is a documentation of singular pop spectacle, unpacking the personalities behind the tour and how they came together to producer something so massive. Of course, that starts with Swift, whose attention to detail is both unsurprising and mesmerizing to witness in the context of pushing the Eras show to become more dazzling. The docuseries showcases the germination of the tour, and how it kept changing &#8212; including the incorporation of a new era, The Tortured Poets Department , as well as recurring and guest stage presences.
