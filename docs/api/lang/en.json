Razer is pitching headphones as a new way to control AI, offering environmental awareness and support for major AI platforms, though it remains a concept with no product plans confirmed. Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair . This year, the company has something equally innovative to share in the form of Project Motoko. At first glance, you’d assume that these were simply a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but underneath you’ll find an incredible amount of AI-powered smarts.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

Perplexity’s latest app release includes code that builds support for Samsung-specific hotword services, indicating device optimization tailored for Galaxy phones and tablets. Perplexity could also potentially arrive as a preinstalled assistant on upcoming Galaxy devices, likely the Galaxy S26 series. Samsung has been collaborating with Perplexity for some time now. Samsung users in the US can already redeem a year’s worth of Perplexity Pro through the Galaxy Store. The company has also integrated Perplexity within Bixby on some of its smart home appliances. Samsung Galaxy phones are also expected to get a Perplexity-powered Bixby experience with One UI 8.5 , and the Galaxy S26 series could even come with pre-installed Perplexity . Samsung’s partnership with Perplexity could go even deeper, as we’ve now spotted hints of an exclusive “Hey Plex” hotword for invoking the digital assistant on Galaxy devices.

    "body": "Credit: LG TL;DR At CES 2026, LG brought back its Wallpaper TV in the form of the LG OLED evo W6. It drops the ugly ribbon cable and forced soundbar of the original version using the Zero Connect Box to deliver an almost cable-free wall-mounted setup. With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",
