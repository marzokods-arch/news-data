After all, the jury acquitted him on the central racketeering and sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The feds overreached and the jury slapped them down, the narrative goes — let’s get those White Parties going again. But the star was convicted, albeit on lesser charges of interstate prostitution.

Combs&#8217; lawyers, on the other hand, want just 14 months — a sentence that would send him home almost immediately on time served. When Combs is sentenced by a federal judge on Friday (Oct. 3), how much time will he actually get? Legal experts told me that it will largely depend on one tricky question: How much the judge separates the “acquitted conduct” that was rejected by the jury from the actions on which Combs was actually convicted.
