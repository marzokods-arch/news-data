It comes with Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, a 5,000mAh battery, and a promise of four OS updates and six years of security updates.

The company has now launched the Xperia 10 VII, a compact mid-ranger that promises to pack a punch without burning a hole in your pocket. Sony Xperia 10 VII specifications and features",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Google could reverse an Android Auto UI change that has upset many users. Instead of using colors from your phone’s wallpaper, Android Auto’s media player could use the album art as the background once again. However, while testing this reversal, Google appears to have messed up another visual aspect in Android Auto. Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance . However, Google now appears to be testing a return to the older design. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

HUAWEI MatePad Pro 12.2 (2025) The HUAWEI MatePad Pro 2025 could almost be my favorite tablet without a few issues. First, let’s go through the specs because they are impressive. It has a 12.2-inch OLED display, and this is one of the best tablets I own for watching content. It offers 2,000 nits of peak brightness and features HUAWEI’s excellent sound tuning. This is probably one of the best-sounding tablets I’ve used in a long time. The tablet’s body is incredibly thin, making it ideal for traveling.",

The editor supports conditions, adds new actions and triggers, and just empowers more complicated automations. While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

London-based electronics maker Nothing fully revealed the design of the Ear (3) in a video released on social media earlier today. The video shows that the earbuds will retain much of the transparent casing the brand has become known for.

Google quickly confirmed the problem, and this week reports that a fix is available to those running Android Auto 15. Despite that news, quite a few Pixel 10 owners share that their problems with Android Auto have yet to resolve. If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

Getting the smart driving companion to work consistently can sometimes be an effort in futility. For example, users recently discovered an issue where Pixel 10 devices would cause Android Auto to freeze . Thankfully, Google has now implemented a fix with the most recent update. However, there’s a new annoying problem on the horizon that’s affecting audio playback. Multiple reports are coming in from Reddit about a bug that’s causing music to stutter and skip when connected to Android Auto wirelessly. The issue looks to be happening regardless of the user’s phone brand. It appears the problem may be connected to Google Maps and Waze.",

YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back at it again with another teardown, this time for the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

Charging phones is finally exciting again! Well, maybe “exciting” is overselling it — and not so much “again,” we guess — but charging is absolutely having a moment. With magnetic Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 series, and fast 25W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Android users are getting in on that MagSafe fun and having a blast doing it. While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand. Unfortunately, some users appear to be buying Pixelsnap Chargers without checking the power requirements first, and are understandably having a pretty frustrating time as a result.",

And we’re not talking performance, either, like how high you can get those benchmark figures, but electrical power: how much charge your phone holds, and how quick and easy it is to get it recharged. Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles .

The description confirms the “Galaxy XR” branding for Samsung’s XR headset. It also confirms that Samsung phones will be able to shoot 3D/spatial images and videos for viewing on the Galaxy XR headset. Samsung teamed up with Google for its Project Moohan headset on the brand-new Android XR platform. Samsung is said to be gearing up to launch the headset very soon , either by the end of this month or the next, depending on which leak you believe. Samsung has now accidentally disclosed that the Project Moohan headset will be called “Galaxy XR,” and that users will be shoot spatial images and videos on their phones to view it on the headset, just like they can on newer iPhones and the Apple Vision Pro. Sammobile reports that a new version of the Camera Assistant app (v4.0.0.3) is available on the Galaxy S25 FE but not yet on other Galaxy devices. This new version of the Good Luck module doesn’t open any exclusive functionality on the Galaxy S25 FE.

This isn’t the first attempt. We’ve seen brands shove heart rate sensors into shoppers’ ears before, and by all means, shoot your shot. Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish. Relying on an earbud to collect your data is like asking a toddler to take your photo; you’ll get something, but it will probably be blurry, crooked, or missing half your head. In this case, you’ll likely have missing stats, shaky data, and dropouts.

Currently, the service only facilitates data sharing between different health and fitness apps and doesn’t track any data on its own.

PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced.

A Telegram user alerted us about the feature, and we confirmed it’s working on our Pixel 9. Last year, Gemini introduced a split-screen shortcut for large-screen Android devices such as foldables and tablets. The feature worked on Samsung devices, the Pixel Tablet, and the Pixel Fold.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority AT&amp;T takes a different approach than Verizon and T-Mobile when it comes to promotions, upgrades, and special deals. While its rivals often advertise free phones with no trade-in required, AT&amp;T rarely offers devices entirely free up front. That can make it less appealing to switchers, but the trade-off is that existing customers typically get the same deals as new ones. The main caveat is that upgrade offers usually require a higher-end plan, whereas new customers can often qualify with even a base unlimited plan. This applies to every deal listed below, unless otherwise noted.",

The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library.

However, Samsung has inevitably criticized Apple’s launch event on Twitter , calling it a “Zzz-note.” The company posted the tweet as part of a competition announcement, where it promises to give away a Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

It’s said that there are three colors: Original Sand Dune, Absolute Black, and Mist Purple. The Absolute Black and Mist Purple SKUs will reportedly weigh 215g, while the Dune color is a little lighter at 211g. Back in June, a leak claimed that the next flagship from OnePlus would have a “SuperBlack” colorway . This black color reportedly has a very high light absorption rate, high enough that “the body looks like a black hole.” But what will this color be called? And while on that topic, what other colors will be available on the OnePlus 15? A new leak may have shed some light on those questions. The leak about the “SuperBlack” color came from trusted tipster Digital Chat Station, who is back with another color-related leak. This time, the Weibo user has revealed what could be the official color names for the OnePlus 15. Additionally, they shared how much each SKU could weigh.",

Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles. But how does that compare to the new iPhone 17 family?",

One of the more exciting aspects of the Pixel 10’s launch was the announcement of the new Pixelsnap accessories . These MagSafe-like items can magnetically snap onto the Pixel 10 without the need for a special case. Now that the Pixel 10 has been out for a couple of weeks, plenty of owners have had the opportunity to use these products. Although they have only been available for a short amount of time, it appears one Pixelsnap accessory is already running into issues. Spotted by 9to5Google , multiple reports are coming in through Reddit about a problem with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. According to the reports, the issue deals with the screws near the hinge, which keep the metal ring attached to the magnetic panel and provide the resistance to prop the Pixel 10 up. These users claim that the screws are becoming undone.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google has delayed releasing the source code for Android 16 QPR1, worrying custom ROM developers who rely on timely AOSP (Android Open Source Project) updates. While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects.

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

Spotify Connect is a lifesaver if you have multiple devices, whereas YouTube Music being bundled in YouTube Premium works out in its favor. Both services have been trying to convert more of their free users into becoming paid customers, and now it seems YouTube Music is borrowing a leaf out of Spotify’s book by paywalling the lyrics feature.

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.
