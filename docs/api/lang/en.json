Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom. So if you're looking to climb the levels and become a master miner, I've got some tips for The Forge first-timers that'll carry you into the late game. Conquer objectives faster by picking up every quest you can (Image credit: FireAtacck / Roblox) Tons of quests in The Forge share overlapping objectives, and if there's a limit on how many you can have at once, I've yet to encounter it. Make your life easier by speaking to every NPC you can and accept whatever tasks they have for you. Most are easy and a nice introduction to the basics—like learning how to mine Stone —while others require quite a bit of grinding.

We didn't call games cozy back in the early 2000s, but were it released today, the slice-of-life adventure game (translated as My Summer Vacation) about exploring a small seaside Japanese town would very much fit the description. So it seems only fitting that the fan translators who did such a marvelous job with that game would wind up getting to do the same for another underappreciated cozy gem—only this time, with official backing. 1999's Milano's Odd Job Collection, out on Steam today , is the first 'legit' project from the fan translators at Hilltop Works, who teamed up with publisher XSeed and emulation-porting house Implicit Conversions to release the game in English for the first time. I think the background of how Milano ended up finally being released in English is maybe even more interesting than the game itself, given how rare it is for fan translations to get the official seal of approval.

    "body": "We've known for some time that Arc Raiders' \"Cold Snap\" winter event was on the horizon, but now exactly when it's happening. According to an Embark X post , the Cold Snap update arrives Tuesday, December 16. According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance? That'd instantly plunge Arc Raiders into the realm of pay-to-win cosmetics, so consider it unlikely, but it would be an interesting wrinkle. 16.12.25 pic.twitter.com/UxQH0nAP1L D…",

Those game studios are obviously of great interest to us, but for the people at Netflix? I don't want to bruise any egos here but, well, not so much . The Netflix disdain was expressed in an investors Q&A earlier this week, when a caller asked if the WBD acquisition would \"enhance or accelerate\" Netflix's gaming ambitions, which have floundered after a hard-charging start: Netflix has closed or sold off the studios it made such a big point of having just a few years previously, and it's biggest idea these days seems to be laying out huge amounts of money for generative AI . Warner, on the other hand, despite some recent major botches of its own, still brings significant gaming strength to the table. That doesn't seem to figure into Netflix's plans, though. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters acknowledged that the WBD pickup would be a boon for his company's gaming division, but not to the extent that it …",

As announced on the official CoD blog today , Activision will no longer make back-to-back Call of Duty games in the same series. The news comes off the back of a weaker than usual year for the franchise , which saw the release of Black Ops 7 just a year after Black Ops 6. Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right,\" the blog reads. \"To be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.

    "body": "The big mystery of the big Game Awards statue in the desert may be solved, and if the sleuthing is correct it does not herald the announcement of a new Elder Scrolls Online expansion. It looks instead to be a tease for the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. Before Larian became known to the world as the developer of Baldur's Gate 3, you see, it was known to RPG nerds as the developer of the Divinity games. The series goes all the way back to 2002 with Divine Divinity, Larian's second game, and stretches to the 2017 release Divinity: Original Sin 2 , one of the best RPGs to come along in years and recipient of our 2017 Game of the Year award . Which brings us to now. As noticed by MP1st , a new European trademark filing for something called Divinity was made today by a German law firm that's previously filed trademark applications for other Larian games. (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Where things really take a turn, though, is in the appearance of a separate filing, made at the same time by the same firm, that doesn't carry the name but does look awfully familiar: (Image credit: Larian Studios (via EUIPO)) Cast your memory back to that big statue in the d…",

Fortunately, thanks to the reveal of shop simulator ReStory during the Wholesome Snack showcase, I no longer have to worry about trying to mend my own belongings and can instead take responsibility for mending others' belongings. In the premiere trailer for ReStory, we get a first glimpse at what life would be like running a repair shop in early 2000s Tokyo. Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny. From the few examples we've seen in the trailer, each item you mend feels like an intricate puzzle. You'll have to snap a tonne of individual pieces back together while rot…",

However, it's quite a deceptive first look. Initially, I thought I was looking at a sweet bug-catching simulator, but it quickly pulls in dating sim elements in a significant change of pace. As you run around, you will in fact catch bugs, but it's what you do with them after that gets me excited to play. Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out. The example given in the trailer shows a butterfly and a slug coming together for dinner, but as you watch them interact it turns out there are by no means a compatible pair. So, it's your job as the bug catcher overlord to find the perfect match for each insect. As you watch these date sequences, bugs will express their likes and dislikes, such as a hard shell or a certain amount of eyes. You know, all those features you probably think of every…",

Though saying that, it might just be me: the trailer alone had me on the verge of tears. In the reveal trailer, we're welcomed to the setting of a summer camp called Camp Pals and given a brief look at what to expect from a day there. While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm.

However, if you're yet to explore the world of Cozy Caravan, then you are in for a treat. But, before you can delve in, you need to make an animal avatar. Rather than this being your typical cat or dog, you're given a wonderful selection of critters to choose from too, including an opossum and raccoon, or even an axolotl if you're more keen on amphibians. Once you've made the impossible selection, you'll be unleashed into the game and get to experience what life as a mobile market is like.

Earlier today, players who've purchased non-deluxe edition digital copies of Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation store and checked for preload details were suddenly treated to updated cover art for the game. And that updated art just so happens to prominently feature our beautiful, spin-kicking son, Leon S. Kennedy. Here's a look: (Image credit: Capcom) Leon's potential inclusion in Requiem has been the subject of speculation since before its first reveal showed the blasted remains of his old Raccoon City stomping grounds—thanks in part to known RE leaker Dusk Golem , who's claimed that Leon is \"not the only playable character, but he is the main character.\" Until now, Capcom has remained thoroughly insistent that Grace Ashcroft is Requiem's protagonist, even as early demos left some of us—like PC Gamer's Morgan Park —with the distinct…",

While that change proved to be a great success in Path of Exile's sequel, it hasn't gone quite so smoothly for Riot, with initial fears that it would unbalance the game now mostly giving way to the opposite problem: players complaining that the controls suck to use. When Riot announced the change in a blog post in August, it framed it as a way to make the game more approachable. “We’ve seen that for new players, WASD is the most familiar control scheme for PC games today, and let’s be real, a lot of us instinctively put our fingers there when coming back to League after playing something else,” the developer said. “By offering WASD as an alternate control scheme, we believe League will feel more intuitive to some players who come from other games.” Soon after the announcement, players were already spiraling into doomsday scenario…",

And while I typically cast such requests into the ether with no real hope that my existence will even be acknowledged, much less responded to, in this case I feel like maybe Ubisoft is ready to throw up its hands and finally cop to the whole thing. Just consider what's happened over the past six months alone: Assassi…",

This fascinating action roguelike feels like a modern spin-off of 2008 god game Spore. Starting as a cute little blob creature, your goal is to survive in an increasingly dangerous ecosystem. Initially you're easy prey, but as you eat food you level up, gaining new genetic traits and (hopefully) rising to the top of the food chain. (Image credit: Odd Dreams Digital) As I set out on my first few runs, what immediately impresses me is the sheer variety of different traits, particularly because a really large selection of them are reflected visually on my creature. I can cover them in scales, fur, or an exoskeleton; give them claws, poison spit, bull horns, or spines; make them huge and lumbering or quick and tiny; and much, much more. It all combines seamlessly, both visually and mechanically—whether I've built the ultimate predator, or (more often) one of God's mistake…",

The latest cohort includes HP, Lenovo, and Dell, all of which have reportedly told customers to expect new year price hikes. Industry sources claim Dell may raise its prices as soon as mid-December, and by as much as 20%. Lenovo on the other hand has apparently told customers that all of its current quotes will expire as of January 1, 2026 (via TrendForce ). Why? You guessed it: memory shortages and surging prices , driven by the demands of big tech's AI pipedreams. HP estimates that memory accounts for around 15 to 18% of the cost of even a fairly standard PC, with CEO Enrique Lores already warning that the second half of 2026 will be a particular challenge pricewise (via Asia Business Daily ). Seeing as PC gaming is expensive as it is, knowing further price hikes are imminent is still a bitter pill to swallow. As such, some have not been shy to voice their displeasure, with Framework for one directly criticising Dell's price hikes.

And I do mean very recently, because it's only earlier today that President Trump said China will be allowed to receive H200 shipments , albeit for a 25% fee (via Reuters ).

It's a proprietary rather than open standard. What really marks this drive out from, say, the even smaller microSD format is the combination of performance and full NVMe 1.4 support. The CL100 measures 15 mm by 17 mm and fits into a slide-in tray that very much resembles a phone SIM tray. A microSD card is just 11 mm by 15 mm, but doesn't offer all the features and performance of a proper NVMe SSD. The Biwin CL100 does. At least, it offers the performance of an NVMe drive with a PCIe 4.0 two-lane interface. On the largest 2 TB model, that allows for maximum read speeds of 3.7 GB/s and maximum writes of 3.5 GB/s.

As shared here by Businesswire (thanks, Automaton ), 3D Investment states that Square Enix has, in the three years since replacing its president , been \"facing the following management issues: (i) a sluggish revenue growth rate and (ii) sluggish profit margins … More recently, SQEX HD recorded massive impairment losses on game development assets, which lack earning power, so SQEX HD is in a very serious situation.\" This is exacerbated by the fact, the shareholder argues, that Square's \"med…",

The actual panel technology has yet to be revealed. However, a number of the specifications that are available (via Display Specifications ) point to a specific subset of IPS tech. Along with the refresh rate, the response time is quoted at 1ms GtG, which is in line with IPS tech. The static contrast is said to be 2,000:1. That would require either VA panel technology, the very latest IPS Black panel from LG or at least a similar IPS-derived tech to LG's IPS Black. Conventional IPS panels top out at 1,300:1 contrast. Given that VA panels tend to be slower than IPS and also typically offer contrast of 3,000:1 to 4,000:1, our money is on IPS for this 1,000 Hz pairing. Likewise, the 2,000:1 contrast makes it very unlikely that these displays use TN panels. VESA DisplayHDR 400 certification is also reportedly in the mix. So, in terms of HDR support, these are entry-level panels and won't have local dimming. It's also worth noting that t…",

But, much like a lot of Minecraft's underwater mobs, they can be quite challenging to track down, let alone tame. With how much of a Minecraft world is covered in ocean, tracking a Nautilus can seem quite intimidating. However, there's actually a pretty solid method you can follow if you're stuck on where to start looking. Here's what you need to do if you want to get an underwater mount for yourself, and how you can tame it once and for all. Where to find Nautilus in Minecraft Nautilus spawn in all ocean biomes in Minecraft, including frozen and warm, which makes the job of hunting one down a little easier. With that said, they don't appear at the surface, and you'll have to delve beyond level 38 to find one .

A number of optional color palettes gave it a bit more pep, like the wine-tinged Bordeaux or the more sophisticated teal of Designer. And then there was Hot Dog Stand, which more or less turned Windows into a carnival. \"The truly funny thing about this color scheme is that all the other Windows 3.1 color schemes are surprisingly rational, totally reasonable color schemes,\" tech blogger Jeff Atwood wrote back in 2005 . \"And then you get to 'Hot Dog Stand.

But it has long-suffering Shenmue fans hopeful: It's been six years since Shenmue 3 dropped (which happened a full 18 years after Shenmue 2), and while Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki has previously expressed a desire to make a new game in the series , there's been no movement toward that actually happening.

Path of Exile 2, however, could be the game at the end of Rogers' \"quest to make the perfect ARPG,\" he told PC Gamer in a recent interview. Despite its differences to PoE 1, some of which have gone away over the last year in early access, \"it was never really about making it feel distinct,\" he says. In the last year, Grinding Gear Games has been navigating the treacherous waters of making a sequel that veers pretty far away from the vibe of the first game. If PoE 1 is a rampage through thousands of monsters, PoE 2 is a dance with far fewer, but more threatening monsters—a fundamental shift in the feel of the game. And not everyone has been a fan of the pivot, especially when any class that feels remotely like PoE 1 inevitably gets gutted in a patch. PoE 1 veterans want to feel like gods and go fast in the new game; Rogers wants combat to feel methodical. …",

He worked on the first iteration of Battlefield 6's level editing/publishing platform during Battlefield 2042 development, back when the toolset was, in his words, \"more like a Battlefield builder than anything.\" In that game, Portal was squarely focused on mashing up different eras of Battlefield. You could pit futuristic jets versus WW2 planes, summon bots, and tweak rules to your heart's content, but without complex scripting or the ability to place new geometry, its creative ceiling was low. \"The people were phenomenal at stretching what we had built to do some amazing things, but they had to really work hard,\" Wiebe told PC Gamer.

The video, titled \"ChatGPT in a real robot does what experts warned,\" is a wider look at the issues involved in the search for superintelligence, the involvement of such systems with the military, and how various AI models respond to somewhat unusual prompts. There is some seriously funny stuff here, in particular an AI 'girlfriend' who ends up calling the host a \"jerk\" before walking off while saying \"it's so good I can actually storm off now.\" But what we're concerned with happens around 10 minutes in ( timestamp ), in a section called \"how far would AI go?\" in these military contexts. First, let's be clear about what we're about to watch. The robots used in the video are supplied by Scan 3XS, a PC and robotics specialist. The model being used in the gun test appears to be the Unitree G1 , which will set you back a cool £21,000 / $28,000. But what's important is that for the purpose of this test it's just a body for ChatGPT: albeit one capable of pulling a trigger. The AI model that is operating the robot, designated Max, is ChatGPT: a human is helping to send comman…",

For $16, you get: Borderlands Game of the Year Enhanced Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Borderlands 2 Borderlands 2 VR Borderlands 3 Tales From the Borderlands New Tales from the Borderlands Tiny Tina's Wonderland: Chaotic Great Edition It's a whole lot of Borderlands for less than $20, and if you happen to want Borderlands 4 you can pick up the bundle with that included for $70. That's a pretty high price for a Humble Bundle, but it effectively means you're paying regular price for Borderlands 4 and getting every other game in the series for free.

Oh yeah, there's also the three other games the company has in development: horror title OD, espionage game PhysInt, and an untitled collaboration with Niantic (of Pokemon GO fame). Kojima's been doing a round of interviews to see out the year, and the latest with the Japanese outlet Ananweb sees him reflecting on all of these game projects. As ever, Kojima says he doesn't think of Death Stranding 2 as \"finished\" because \"I actually wanted to continue until around September.\" Kojima says that the studio's games \"have to be unique and sell to a certain extent. This is difficult. Our previous game, Death Stranding, was too unique, so we had to carefully adjust the balance to broaden the audience for this one.\" The example he gives is a snowy mountain that's twice as high as anything in the previous game: \"When we gathered monitors and played it for the first time, everyone…",

Verified Link: Steam There's a simple reason: I never trusted I could do it without exploding my whole skeleton. Nevertheless I behold the skateboard with a kind of talismanic reverence. It's an implement that grants a different relationship with our earthly geometry. Skating is an almost occultic discipline, its practitioners defying worldly convention to dabble in transcendent matters of slope, rotation, and bodily contortion. Skate Story takes that to an extreme. If Dante Alighieri had known that skateboarding could be a weapon of metaphysical rebellion against hell and reality itself, his Inferno would also have followed a \"demon made of glass and pain\" who's entered into a contract with the Devil to eat the moon in exchange for their soul.
