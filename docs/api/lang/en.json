That’s why we have gadgets like massage guns, foam rollers, and specialized shoes with plates and innovative midsole foams. Sometimes, though, that’s still not enough. When that happens, runners turn to even more extreme measures to get their miles in. We buy shoes with illegal stack heights, pick up fancy compression boots to squeeze the pain out of our legs, and step into exoskeletons to make each step easier.

Two ways for brands to achieve that objective have been to establish their own ecosystems or to replicate iOS-like visual elements. On this topic, my colleague Rita El Koury recently wrote about the profound impact that Apple’s design choices have on Android brands . While most Android purists might disagree, I’m glad that one of my favorite Android brands , OnePlus, is implementing some iOS-inspired features. One of my favorites lets you control accessories, especially wireless earbuds, much more easily. The addition comes with OnePlus’ new OxygenOS 16 interface, introduced to the OnePlus 13 late last month and now rapidly spreading to several older or less premium devices (while the OnePlus 15 arrived with it out of the box).",

    "body": "Bob “Bongo” Starkie, guitarist for the trailblazing Australian rock band Skyhooks, has died at 73 after a year-long battle with acute myeloid leukemia. His death was confirmed Tuesday on the group’s official Facebook page. Skyhooks archivist Peter Green announced the news, writing that Starkie “passed away early this morning” after spending the past year undergoing treatment while still hoping to return to the stage. Green remembered him as the youngest member of the band who “embraced the theatrics” that became a signature part of Skyhooks’ identity — from bold makeup and elaborate stage outfits to the irreverent swagger that helped define the group’s rise. “The music always came first,” Green wrote, adding that performing live “was his absolute joy” and that “music was in his blood till the very end.” Starkie joined Skyhooks in August 1973, replacing his older brother Peter Starkie, who died in 2020 at age 72 following complications from a fall. Peter was one of the musicians who helped establish the early lineup that would go on to dominate Australian rock in the mid-1970s. In a tribute shared through the band’s page , Starkie’s daughter Indiana said her father “peacefully depa…",

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

A wireless charger is usually near the top of that list, and this Belkin Quick Charge Stand has dropped to an all-time low of $14.50 on Amazon. It usually sells for $24.99, so it’s a solid price for a branded 15W charger. The stand delivers up to 15W wireless charging on supported phones and props your device up vertically or horizontally. It’s handy if you want to keep an eye on messages or watch something while your phone tops up. People tend to report steady charging speeds and no major heat issues, which is about all most of us are looking for in a budget Qi stand.",

Each has four controller ports in the front, a power button, a menu dial, and an eject button at the back.

The solution is to update the LockStar module in Good Lock to the latest version. One of the most visually stimulating features One UI brings is called Adaptive Clock, which dynamically wraps the lockscreen clock around the subject in the wallpaper. The feature, initially available to Samsung users via the Good Lock module Lockstar, became more widely available with One UI 8 and is set for another upgrade with One UI 8.5 . But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended. For instance, it may not recognize humans or pets and apply shabbily over their faces instead of adapting to the outlines of their heads or bodies. This issue has recently cropped up after a recent update.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is testing a new “2.4 and 6 GHz” dual-band option for Wi-Fi hotspots in the latest Android Canary build. This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots. Pixel users can now create a 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspot by going to Se…",

In addition to NBCUniversal and Disney, YouTube TV reached a stalemate with TelevisaUnivision, resulting in the loss of Univision at the end of September. Nearly two months later, Univision channels are finally coming back. YouTube TV is not in the streaming game to make friends, and that should be perfectly clear from the multiple carriage disputes it’s had with companies in the content game these past few months. There was that public spat with NBCUniversal , and most recently the service dropped Disney-owned channels for a few weeks until a new deal could be worked out. While those have been back for a minute, there’s been another set of channels absent this whole time — and YouTube TV is only now getting around to restoring them.

Amazon just launched a Kindle Sling Bag, and it has plenty of potential. Functionally, it’s a simple crossbody. Culturally, it’s Amazon acknowledging what readers have been doing forever: turning their e-readers into everyday-carry essentials. Inside, the sling offers a dedicated padded pocket sized for Kindles plus separate slots for accessories like a USB-C cable, headphones, or a small portable charger. The organization system is pretty basic, but most readers don’t need a full tactical pack, just something that keeps their device safe from scratches. There’s even a small, quick-access pocket on the front for keys or other small items.",

A new “don’t ask me again” checkbox allows the system to remember your preference for specific monitors. This streamlines the setup process, removing the need to dig through Settings to switch between mirroring and desktop modes. With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , certain Pixel phones gained more flexibility when connected to an external display. Rather than being restricted to simple screen mirroring, they can now project a desktop-like interface via Android’s new Desktop Mode . While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it. Without these peripherals, controlling apps becomes difficult unless your external display has a touchscreen. In these cases, screen mirroring remains the better option, as it allows you to navigate using your phone while viewing content on the big screen.",
