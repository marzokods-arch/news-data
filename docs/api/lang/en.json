After all, the jury acquitted him on the central racketeering and sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The feds overreached and the jury slapped them down, the narrative goes — let’s get those White Parties going again. But the star was convicted, albeit on lesser charges of interstate prostitution. And these weren’t misdemeanors: Prosecutors want at least 11 years in prison, and the probation office says he deserves seven years. Combs&#8217; lawyers, on the other hand, want just 14 months — a sentence that would send him home almost immediately on time served. When Combs is sentenced by a federal judge on Friday (Oct. 3), how much time will he actually get? Legal experts told me that it will largely depend on one tricky question: How much the judge separates the “acquitted conduct” that was rejected by the jury from the actions on which Combs was actually convicted. That might seem like common sense, but it’s actually a controversial issue and the key dispute between Combs and prosecutors ahead of sentencing. Experts say it’s also a serious challenge for a federal judge: “I…",

If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place.

This limited-time offer is available until November 3 and includes taxes and fees in the monthly price. Visible is likely the prepaid service I recommend the most to those looking for a low-cost alternative to postpaid without noticeably sacrificing network performance, and that’s especially true for its Visible Plus and Visible Plus Pro plans. While the most expensive of these options typically runs for $45 a month (taxes and fees included), what if you could get six months of service for just $22.50 a month ? Starting today, if you prepay for 3 months of service ($135), you’ll get an additional three months for absolutely free. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Update 3, October 1, 2025 (02:02 PM ET): We’ve officially heard back from Samsung about this incident, and the company tells us that it is currently investigating the matter. It’s probably far too early to speculate where that investigation will lead, but we look forward to updating you with any outcome the company ultimately shares.

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority AT&amp;T handles its promotions differently from Verizon or T-Mobile. Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

It is also working on EEG devices that strap around the ear and can be used to study drowsiness or increased activity during specific videos, which can eventually be used for hyper-targeted advertising. Wearables have increasingly been hailed as guardians of human lives. Close-to-medical-grade detection techniques already alert us to certain conditions, even before symptoms progress in the body. While hypertension , sleep apnea , or Atrial Fibrillation can now be commonly detected on smartwatches, AI is enhancing the scope of detection and utility, accelerating detection with fewer data points. With this, Samsung is working on a feature to detect another leading cause of heart failure, right from your wrist.

Over the last decade, many of these services have either become obsolete or been integrated into core features in Android. But they continue to remain in our hearts. Today, we’re recounting legendary apps that helped shape Android and made it more meaningful than the barebones stock version of yesteryears. Here are my top picks for Android apps that had a fundamental — almost irreplaceable — role on Android phones in the past. Most of these apps no longer exist, haven’t been updated in a while, or have undergone radical changes — for the worse — in recent years, but their contributions remain unmatched.",

Some users are seeing that keyboard button change to an arrow/open shortcut, allowing you to quickly open an app right from the keyboard. Google only appears to be testing this with a small number of users, with unclear plans for a wider rollout. The Pixel Launcher ‘s search bar is already one of its best features, allowing you to quickly perform a Google Search or find an app right from your home screen. According to some user reports, it appears that the latter functionality may soon receive a notable upgrade. As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it. If you tap the search button at the bottom right of your keyboard, the Pixel Launcher (annoyingly) searches for the app name on Google rather than opening it.",

It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future. The original piece argued that new hardware, a redesigned Home app, and the integration of Gemini could finally put Google’s smart home back on track. However, the comments reve…",

It’s the first chipset ever to be built on a 2nm fabrication process. The Exynos 2600 production cycle already has a 50% yield, suggesting the chip may be ready in time. Next-gen Android flagships have already started to arrive on the back of Qualcomm’s earlier-than-usual announcement of its Elite phone chipset. After Xiaomi 17, the OnePlus 15 is inching closer to its launch. But while there’s no confirmation about the Galaxy S26 series’ launch timeline, we now have another piece of evidence supporting the fact that it will not be a Snapdragon-only affair . Samsung’s semiconductor division has reportedly kicked off mass production of the slated Exynos 2600 chipset. Korean news outlet The Bell states that Samsung has not only achieved this feat earlier than expected, but it has accomplished it while increasing the wafer’s yield to 50%, up from 30% in the first quarter of the year.",

However, if history is any indication, I think you should look elsewhere. Security cameras are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them are so cheap that it’s ludicrous to consider something as expensive as a $100-200 Nest Cam. Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this. But after careful consideration, I couldn’t justify paying this much on a Nest Cam and committing to a monthly subscription. I looked into Nest Cam alternatives and landed on the TP-Link Tapo C225 () instead. I couldn’t be happier with my choice. Here’s why.",

Using this feature, up to 20 devices can connect to the same audio, which is excellent whether you want to share your music or watch a movie with a large group of friends. However, when you’re allowing other people to connect to your audio stream, you must either pair another pair of headphones manually or scan a QR code using another phone that’s already connected to those headphones.
