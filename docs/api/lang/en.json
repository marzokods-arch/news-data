    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority A smartwatch, to me, is a vital companion for my phone. It helps me effectively manage my low self-control to use the phone, while allowing me to stay on top of notifications and important calls. If you, like me, willingly stick with Android and want to access apps that sync with your phone directly on your wrist, then Wear OS is your best option. Therefore, the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are two of the best smartwatches with Wear OS you can buy. The Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are both from distinct lots that may not typically appeal to the same kind of users. If you already own a Samsung phone, and don’t mind sticking to the comparatively less restrictive ecosystem (than Apple’s) , the Galaxy Watch is the way to go. If you cherish the best of Google and want the latest features — which will eventually trickle down to all devices — from Wear OS, the Pixel Watch 4 may be the right pick for you.",

Although I’ve seen many users recommend this app across various online forums, I haven’t spent much time exploring all its features. And wow, there’s a lot to uncover here. Not a smooth transition At its core, AIO Launcher is unlike any other home screen on the market. It’s decidedly different from traditional products like Nova Launcher and Smart Launcher, but I can’t quite compare it to other niche launchers. The best way to describe it is as an amalgamation of Kvaesitso’s endless scrolling home screen and Niagara Launcher’s app drawer, but this isn’t a bang-on description.",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software.

The Miyoo Mini Flip has the same 2.8-inch screen as 2021’s Miyoo Mini, but apart from that, the company hasn’t announced specs or pricing.

Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.

It’s added new Photographic Styles to the mix, reworked the camera app to give it a more straightforward interface, and finally upgraded its camera hardware with a significantly improved 4x telephoto sensor . Unsurprisingly, it has me reaching for the iPhone camera more than ever before, and it’s making me wonder whether the Pixel 10 Pro really has my favorite camera system. So, to settle things once and for all, I decided to put the two giants to the test. I set out to grab a series of snaps across some of the most common focal lengths to see if I really still liked Google’s processing the best. Here’s what I found.",

    "body": "Credit: Amazon TL;DR Amazon updated its Kindle Colorsoft FAQs with a candid disclaimer. The company says that black-and-white Kindles, like the Paperwhite, offer crisper text. Colorsoft screens still suit comics and PDFs, but trade sharpness for color. Color E-Ink might be all the rage these days thanks to the Kindle Colorsoft lineup, but even Amazon is admitting there’s a trade-off. The company has updated its product FAQs to note that while its Colorsoft screens deliver a “high-quality reading and writing experience,” the black-and-white Kindles, such as the Paperwhite and Scribe, still offer slightly crisper text. As spotted by Good e-Reader , Amazon added near-identical wording to the FAQ pages for both the new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and the cheaper 16GB Colorsoft model . The company explains that the color layer responsible for bringing illustrations to life also changes the screen’s texture and brightness. If you’re after the sharpest black-and-white reading experience, Amazon suggests checking out its monochrome Kindles instead.",

Pixel users can expect features like auto-themed app icons, an expanded dark theme, icon shape customization, and much more. Since QPR2 is going to be a big update, Google is working to ensure it doesn’t bring a ton of new bugs, so the company rolled out a new beta today to find and fix them before release. Google rolled out Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 earlier today to all supported Pixel devices, from the Pixel 6 series to the new Pixel 10 series. In terms of changes, the update doesn’t bring as many new features as QPR2 Beta 1 or QPR2 Beta 2 , but it does still fix a ton of bugs and introduces a new security patch level.",
