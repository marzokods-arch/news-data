    "body": "With the release of Android 12 back in 2021, Google made a somewhat controversial change to the Quick Settings panel. Gone were the individual toggles for Wi-Fi and mobile data. In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

The achievement adds to a standout year for women on the ARIA albums tally. Dean becomes the ninth female artist to land a No. 1 album in 2025, joining a list that includes Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde and Taylor Swift — a run that’s shaped much of the year’s chart narrative. Dean is also doubling up at the top. Her single “Man I Need” clocks a fifth straight week at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the fourth solo female artist to lead the singles tally in 2025, alongside Lola Young, Doechii and Swift. The year’s singles race has largely been driven by women, from Rosé’s extended reign with “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars to the surprise dominance of “Golden” by fictional K-pop group HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters .

Google is now relaxing the deadline, and instead says that transition will continue as we move into 2026. Right now, Google Home users are starting to experience the transition to Gemini , but for all our mobile devices, the ball got rolling on the big Gemini switch months and months ago. Back in March, Google announced its plans to replace Assistant on nearly all Android phones with Gemini by the end of 2025. With the year now rapidly drawing to a close, Google’s got an update on those plans for us. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Instead of Windows 11 or an ROG Ally-style Xbox interface, this Legion Go 2 version is expected to run SteamOS. SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen.

Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while.

Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu.

But my colleagues’ initial reactions to the phone shook that conviction. In their initial testing, my colleague Robert Triggs found the new phone running at nearly scorching temperatures . That’s a good thing if you’re near the North Pole, helping Santa pack gifts for kids. But for the rest of us mere mortals, those temperatures — I’m talking about nearly 53°C (127°F) on the surface, were bothersome, and especially harrowing for mobile gamers who intend to use it for several dozen minutes, if not hours, holding the phone in their hands while fragging foes in leading FPS games.",

Compared to existing foldables, it may be wider than Google’s Pixel Fold, but not as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to announce the device by late 2026, though shipments might not stabilize until mid-to-late 2027 due to production ramp-up issues. The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year. While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

The update includes 163 new characters, featuring additions like a distorted face, fight cloud, and orca. You can view these new emoji right now if you install the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 on a compatible Pixel. Emoji play a core role in how people communicate online, allowing us to express ourselves with playful images and symbols rather than just text. New emoji arrive each year to expand our expressive range, and to ensure they appear correctly on everyone’s device, regardless of the platform, they are codified in the Unicode standard. The latest version — Unicode 17.0 — dropped on September 9, 2025, introducing over 160 new characters. While the stable release of Android doesn’t support them yet, that is set to change with next year’s third quarterly release of Android 16 . Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience.

The deal reflects Verizon’s rent-instead-of-own strategy, following its exit from tower ownership last year, which has become the industry norm for all major US carriers. Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage.
