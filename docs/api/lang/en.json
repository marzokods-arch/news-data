That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested. Read full article Comments",

Then, in July , the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare \"closeout\" plans for their spacecraft. Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending. Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio. Preliminary efforts to shut down active missions were put on hold . Read full article Comments",

Acting as a shadow library and a search engine for other shadow libraries, Anna's Archive aims to archive books and other written materials and make them widely available via torrents. Its data sets have also been heavily used by AI companies to train large language models. In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna's Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy of the most streamed songs.

    "body": "Soon, even loafing around on the couch won't help you steer clear of AI. TV makers are busily integrating AI models into the experience, and Google is no different. At CES, the company announced a big expansion of Gemini features on the Google TV platform, starting with TCL smart TVs. Google began integrating Gemini with the TV Streamer box this past fall, but the new expansion brings some of the company's most popular AI features to TVs: Nano Banana (image) and Veo (video), which offered a huge leap in visual fidelity at launch and have only improved with subsequent updates . Both models will be part of the TV experience, allowing users to modify or create new content. Google Photos AI remixing in Google TV. Credit: Google The Google TV platform connects to Google Photos, allowing Gemini to access those images with your approval. Gemini can generate a slideshow of your choosing on the spot, but it can also feed those images into Veo or Nano Banana. Using Gemini voice controls, you can remix a photo or turn a still image into a video. You can also enter a solo prompt to generate a totally new image or video with Google's AI on your TV.

On Saturday, X Safety finally posted an official response after nearly a week of backlash over Grok outputs that sexualized real people without consent. Offering no apology for Grok's functionality, X Safety blamed users for prompting Grok to produce CSAM while reminding them that such prompts can trigger account suspensions and possible legal consequences. \"We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary,\" X Safety said. \"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\" Read full article Comments",
