Or choose the even brighter Dangbei DBOX02, also on sale for just $1,099. A nice digital projector is a fantastic way to add some size and spectacle to your next movie night, and while there are some utterly fantastic options available out there, there are also lots of underpowered solutions that might save you some money upfront, but are just also hampered by compromise after compromise. We love saving money as much as the next guy, though, so we’re always looking for opportunities to save big on the kind of projector hardware that won’t leave you full of regrets — and if you’re willing to act fast, we just might have one for you. Earlier this summer we were telling you about the launch of the Dangbei DBOX02 Pro , a 4K laser projector running Google TV. The interface is already a big win right there, and that bright laser light source give it 2000 ISO lumens output, meaning you’re actually going to be able to see things, even during the day.",

NASA/GSFC/Solar Dynamics Observatory It looked like the Sun was heading toward a historic lull in activity. That trend flipped in 2008, according to new research. The Sun has become increasingly active since 2008, a new NASA study shows. Solar activity is known to fluctuate in cycles of 11 years, but there are longer-term variations that can last decades. Case in point: Since the 1980s, the amount of solar activity had been steadily decreasing all the way up to 2008, when solar activity was the weakest on record. At that point, scientists expected the Sun to be entering a period of historically low activity. But then the Sun reversed course and started to become increasingly active, as documented in the study , which appears in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. It’s a trend that researchers said could lead to an uptick in space weather events, such as solar storms, flares, and coronal mass ejections. “All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,” said Jamie Jasinski of NASA’s Jet Pro…",

    "body": "One of the challenges many teachers face year after year is a sense of working alone. Despite the constant interaction with students many questions often linger: Did the lesson stick? Will students carry this knowledge with them? Will it shape how they see and engage with the world? What can be easy to overlook is that teaching does not happen in isolation. Each classroom, or any other educational setting, is part of a much larger journey that learners travel. This journey extends through a network of educators, where each experience can build on the last. These interconnected networks, known as Connected Learning Ecosystems (CLEs), exist wherever learning happens. At their core, CLEs are the collective of people who contribute to a young person’s growth and education over time. Educators at the August 2025 Connected Learning Ecosystems Gathering in Orono, ME engaged in discussion around using NASA data in their learning contexts. Recognizing this, NASA’s Science Activation Program launched the Learning Ecosystems Northeast (LENE) project to strengthen and connect regional educator networks across Maine and the broader Northeast.

Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out. Not only does the lack of contrast look bad, but it also makes it difficult to read any white text in the window.

Phone cameras, with their ever-evolving megapixel counts , especially take center stage in this rivalry, as brands continually vie to outdo one another. Recently, 200MP has been the current gold standard for cameras on flagship Android phones. Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 .

Emulate NASA announced a trailblazing experiment that aims to take personalized medicine to new heights. The experiment is part of a strategic plan to gather valuable scientific data during the Artemis II mission, enabling NASA to “know before we go” back to the lunar surface and on to Mars. The AVATAR (A Virtual Astronaut Tissue Analog Response) investigation will use organ-on-a-chip devices, or organ chips, to study the effects of deep space radiation and microgravity on human health. The chips will contain cells from Artemis II astronauts and fly side-by-side with crew on their approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. This research, combined with other studies on the health and performance of Artemis II astronauts, will give NASA insight into how to best protect astronauts as exploration expands to the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

    "body": "TL;DR Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max provides more transparent marketing than most other fast chargers. The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

Three iPhone 16 series models occupied the top three spots, but two Galaxy phones beat the iPhone 16e. The iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the list, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Xiaomi Redmi 14C 4G also made appearances. Apple and Samsung tend to dominate the list of most popular smartphones each quarter. Now, Counterpoint Research has announced the top ten best-selling phones of Q2 2025, and it’s mostly business as usual. Counterpoint Research revealed that iPhone 16 series handsets were the top three most popular smartphones in Q2 2025 . The iPhone 16 was at the top, followed by the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and then the iPhone 16 Pro. Curiously, the iPhone 16 Plus was entirely missing from the top ten list. So we can perhaps see why the company changed tack and launched the iPhone Air last week.",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

We first heard about this problem one week ago, with online forums and social media filling up with reports of new Pixel 10 series owners who were struggling to get their Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch 7, and Galaxy Watch Ultra models to connect over Bluetooth.

Unlike most prepaid brands, Gigs-powered services can openly advertise that they run on AT&amp;T’s network. Carriers are increasingly making it easier for independent companies to launch their own wireless brands. Last year, T-Mobile unveiled “ Your Name, Our Wireless ,” a program where virtually any business can set up its own carrier, with T-Mobile doing most of the heavy lifting. Now AT&amp;T is taking a similar step, though with a few twists. Instead of running everything directly, AT&amp;T is working with Gigs, a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) that provides the back-end tools needed for others to create and manage prepaid services on AT&amp;T’s network.

Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others.

Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users.

Leaks suggest the camera kit could feature a magnetic photography grip and an external telephoto converter. OPPO recently renewed its partnership with Hasselblad to co-develop a “next-generation mobile imaging system.” Android flagships offer some of the best camera experiences you can carry in your pocket, and most users will be served just fine with them. Some power users want more out of their Ultra phones, but you can only do so much within the physical constraints of a smartphone. Xiaomi has experimented with lens modules that attach to your phone , realme has experimented with attaching a camera lens to the phone sensor , and vivo went mainstream with the X200 Ultra’s external lens .

Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all.

The bug may be linked to a recent update to Google Maps and Waze. Users are switching to Bluetooth streaming to fix the problem. Although Android Auto is great, it isn’t without its faults. Getting the smart driving companion to work consistently can sometimes be an effort in futility. For example, users recently discovered an issue where Pixel 10 devices would cause Android Auto to freeze . Thankfully, Google has now implemented a fix with the most recent update. However, there’s a new annoying problem on the horizon that’s affecting audio playback. Multiple reports are coming in from Reddit about a bug that’s causing music to stutter and skip when connected to Android Auto wirelessly. The issue looks to be happening regardless of the user’s phone brand. It appears the problem may be connected to Google Maps and Waze.",

The teardown reveals just how easy it would be to repair the flagship phone. Google made the battery and display especially easy to remove. As other brands continue to make their smartphones increasingly difficult to repair, it appears Google has gone the opposite direction with the Pixel 10 . The Pixel 10 Pro XL has now been fully disassembled in a new teardown video. This video reveals that Google had repairability in mind when designing the flagship phone. YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back at it again with another teardown, this time for the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Before the teardown even begins, JRE points out that Google released a 234-page repair manual for the device for free. Google also has a 239-page manual for the Pixel 10 Pro and a 228-page manual for the base model.",

Charging phones is finally exciting again! Well, maybe “exciting” is overselling it — and not so much “again,” we guess — but charging is absolutely having a moment. With magnetic Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 series, and fast 25W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Android users are getting in on that MagSafe fun and having a blast doing it. While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand. Unfortunately, some users appear to be buying Pixelsnap Chargers without checking the power requirements first, and are understandably having a pretty frustrating time as a result.",

Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones.

Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish. Relying on an earbud to collect your data is like asking a toddler to take your photo; you’ll get something, but it will probably be blurry, crooked, or missing half your head.
