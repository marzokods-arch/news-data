Over a waltzing melody, Lopez goes full Broadway, as she belts her way through the John Kander and Frank Ebb-penned classic about love, seduction and death. &#8220;Sooner or later, in sunlight or bloom/ When the red candles flicker, she&#8217;ll walk in the room,&#8221; she sings on the track. &#8220;And the curtain will shake and the fires will hiss/ Here comes her kiss.&#8221; Alongside the new single, JLo also shared a set of new photos from the film, depicting her character dressed in a shimmering green gown and spiky black bangs, posed in a prison cell and against a massive web.

With the Pixel 10 series, Google has also launched the Pixel Care Plus program for $0 battery repairs, though that is an insurance program. If you prefer taking matters into your own hands, you’d be glad to learn that the Pixel 10 series has made battery repairs slightly easier than before, but a lot can still be improved. The good folks at iFixit took apart the base Pixel 10 to see just how repairable it is.

But not only has the full band made it to each of the 22 dates on its much-anticipated stadium tour — the lads&#8217; first tour of any kind since breaking up in 2009 — but Oasis has been receiving the best reviews, the most attention and the overall greatest feelings that it&#8217;s been able to claim since the mid-&#8217;90s, when it was arguably the biggest band in the world.

    "body": "BMX is bringing solid-state tech to battery packs with a 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh solution. Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Although this will still be an early access, I can’t wait to get my proverbial hands on it because I’m sick of Google Assistant’s glitches . The inconsistency, frequent bugs, and silly downgrades have taken the joy out of using a “smart” speaker, to a point where I find myself arguing with it more often than using it. Gemini, however, has been a lot more interesting to use on my Pixel phones and watches, and I can’t help but think that this will be a huge upgrade for everyone. Here’s why.",

This bug is technically different, but the end result is the same. Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency. Unlike previous Pixels, the call went through. However, the user only heard what they describe as “garbled beeps, shrill electronic screeches, and the occasional ghost of a human word buried in the noise.” The user tried four times, but faced the same issue.…",

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025.

On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo.

With this launch, XGIMI sets its sights squarely on home theater heavyweights like Epson and BenQ. The Horizon 20 Series comes in three variants, the Horizon 20, 20 Pro, and flagship 20 Max, but it’s the Max that steals the spotlight. With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room.

But this evolution comes with a new concern: over-saturation. There are now well over a dozen reputable prepaid carriers, along with a seemingly endless wave of smaller providers. In 2025 alone, at least five new mobile services have either been announced or even launched already, including Klarna Mobile , SmartLess Mobile, Trump Mobile , Gerald BNPL Mobile, and an upcoming service from MrBeast .

The Galaxy Tab S11 replaces the Plus model in a more compact form but with similar power to the Ultra. The Ultra has a massive 14.6-inch display and is both thinner and lighter than last year’s model. Samsung is refreshing its flagship Android tablet lineup today with the introduction of the new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. These tablets come with incremental changes over the previous Galaxy Tab S10 series, and we’ll walk you through all of those. Let’s start with the immediately apparent change: the naming. With this launch, Samsung is eliminating the Plus variant — for now, at least — and reviving the standard Galaxy Tab S11, which features a smaller 10.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution. A similar lineup rejig is expected of the Galaxy S26 series , where Samsung is likely to eliminate the Galaxy S26 Plus and rename the base Galaxy S26 to S26 Pro.",

So when the latest GPT-5 model launched last month, it felt like a release OpenAI couldn’t afford to get wrong.
