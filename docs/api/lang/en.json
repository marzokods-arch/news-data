Set to drop on Tuesday (Dec. 2) on Netflix, the four-part documentary includes never-before-seen footage of Combs in the days leading up to his arrest last September. Combs’ attorney, Michael Tremonte , says in a Monday (Dec. 1) demand letter that the footage was recorded by the rap mogul’s employees and then “illicitly disclosed” to Netflix later on. According to Tremonte, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos first approached Combs about making a documentary back in 2023, but Combs rejected the idea when it became clear he wouldn’t have creative control. Netflix wanted to “punish Mr. Combs for refusing to play by its rules,” Tremonte says — so the company gave the producing gig and allegedly stolen footage to his longtime rival , 50 (Curtis Jackson). “The evidence of Mr. Jackson’s vicious animus against Mr. Combs is overwhelming.

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a type of technology that helps machines and computers have “thinking” abilities similar to humans. Devices using AI can learn words and concepts, recognize objects, see patterns, or make predictions. They can also be taught how to work autonomously . AI is often used to help people understand and solve problems more quickly than they could on their own. AI includes: Machine learning: This type of AI looks at large amounts of data and learns how to make fast and accurate predictions based on that data.&nbsp; Deep learning: This type helps computers operate much like the human brain. It uses several layers of “thought” to recognize patterns and learn new information. Deep learning is a type of machine learning.&nbsp; Generative AI: A human can use generative AI to create text, videos, images, and more. It is based on deep learning.

A lawsuit alleges the CEO withheld $1 million in wages and fired executives without authorization, followed by widespread service outages and reports of full service shutdowns. The CEO has reportedly fled to Brazil, and customers are struggling to recover account information or get clear answers on what is going on, making it urgent to transfer out as soon as possible. Last year, I wrote about a great new promotion from Mobi. At the time , I explained that this was an established carrier, even if most people have never heard of it, as its primary market is Hawaii. In my exact words, “Mobi is no fly-by-night operation, and you can absolutely trust them.” Welp, that didn’t age well. For years, Mobi was a trusted brand with a lot of potential, but suddenly it’s all come crashing down, as first reported by Fierce Network. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Sgr B2 is the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from our central supermassive black hole.

MIRI has both a camera and a spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. MIRI’s view reveals colorful stars punctuated occasionally by bright clouds of gas and dust. Further research into these stars will reveal details of their masses and ages, which will help astronomers better understand the process of star formation in this dense, active galactic center region.

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR MKBHD is shutting down the Panels app at the end of this month, citing issues with finding the right development team fit. You can no longer buy collections, and you must download existing wallpapers before the app is removed. Users will receive automatic pro-rated refunds for active subscriptions, and the app code is promised to be open-sourced after shutdown. Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified . Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Marques has announced that Panels is shutting down. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The feature reduces the steps required to swap SIMs after Google previously removed the SIM selector from the compose bar and buried it inside the profile page. The new method for switching SIMs is a helpful improvement, but still redirects to the profile section instead of switching SIMs instantly. Being able to quickly and easily switch SIMs while texting is an important feature for Google Messages users who use two different lines on the same phone. However, earlier this year, Google made that simple action more frustrating by burying the SIM switcher deeper in the UI and adding unnecessary extra steps to the process.

Buoyed by burgeoning industrial and agricultural sectors, the city’s population rose by 1.7 million people over the past four decades as its footprint on the West African landscape expanded several times over . Amid bustling new networks of roads, residential neighborhoods, markets, and workshops, lie signs of a much earlier era, when the city was the seat of a powerful pre-colonial kingdom. Remnants of ancient earthworks, thought to be among the longest in the world, can even be seen in images of the city captured from space. Benin Iya (sometimes called the Benin Earthworks, the Walls of Benin, and the Benin Moat) is a vast, cellular network of interlocking earthen walls, ramparts, and ditches that radiate outward from a central moat at the heart of the city. Built in sections over hundreds of years between the 7th and 14th centuries, the system was key to marking defensive, political, and economic boundaries and played an important role in maintaining order and stabili…",

I’m cautiously excited about the prospects of my favourite mobile OS on bigger screens, though we won’t see it in consumers’ hands until sometime in 2026, and there’s still a lot we don’t know. Building a great modern laptop OS isn’t easy. Google will need to get the UI right, ensure excellent driver and peripheral support, make software easy to find and install (including tools outside its ecosystem), and work with reliable hardware partners. That’s a lengthy checklist — and we won’t know how well it’s been met until products hit the shelves.",

Rather than taking it as an invitation to unplug and unwind, Twitter users began freaking out, reading it as in support of YouTube pause-screen ads. YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

The solution is to update the LockStar module in Good Lock to the latest version.

The feature, initially available to Samsung users via the Good Lock module Lockstar, became more widely available with One UI 8 and is set for another upgrade with One UI 8.5 . But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended. For instance, it may not recognize humans or pets and apply shabbily over their faces instead of adapting to the outlines of their heads or bodies. This issue has recently cropped up after a recent update.",
