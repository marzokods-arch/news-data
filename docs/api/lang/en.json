Footage of Pooh Shiesty back home and celebrating regaining his freedom emerged on social media on Monday. While fans were elated, many were surprised, since Shiesty&#8217;s original release date was slated for April 2026. The Federal Bureau of Prisons database system also revealed that the &#8220;Back in Blood&#8221; rapper was no longer in BOP custody. Shiesty (real name Lontrell Williams) had been behind bars in federal prison since 2022, serving a 63-month sentence on firearm conspiracy charges. The charges stemmed from an October 2020 shooting in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla. Prosecutors argued that Pooh Shiesty and two others met up to make a deal for marijuana and high-end sneakers, but an altercation transpired outside the Landon Hotel and the two sellers were shot. Both survived. Shiesty was indicted on four counts related to the shooting. After posting bond, the rapper was arrested for a shooting at the King of Diamonds strip club in Miami in May 2021.

This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

How far would you go to get a stolen phone back?

Lock down your data, sure (if not full-on erase everything), but what then? Just give all your info to the police and hope for the best? You might not have a lot of faith that reports like that can actually go anywhere, but today we’re hearing about a major police action in the UK that broke up a phone-smuggling ring, and it all got started by tracking one stolen phone.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority The holiday season marketing seems to creep closer and closer every year, and Amazon is back again, trying to outpace everyone before Black Friday with its Prime Big Deal Days. Lucky for us geeks and tech lovers, though, this is an excellent opportunity to grab some great products at a discounted price to start enjoying them a bit earlier than holiday shoppers. I’ve been a Pixel user since 2017 and have tried nearly every Pixel, Pixel Watch, and Pixel Buds out there. So, I’m here to help you weed out the dud deals among Google’s discounted hardware, and find the ones that actually make the most sense — you know, the ones I’d actually buy if I didn’t already have them in front of me.",

This isn’t a revolutionary product by any stretch of the imagination, but I do feel like Google’s headed in the right direction with this one.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is currently looking to expand access to its Nano Banana editor by integrating it across apps and services. We’ve uncovered evidence of Nano Banana preparations in Google Lens and Circle to Search. The Lens integration appears slightly further along, and mirrors what we’ve already seen from Search AI Mode. Nano Banana might be the best thing to happen to Google’s AI offerings in a while, and over the last few weeks we’ve had a lot of fun checking out what the system can do — even if it does seem to struggle a little with varying aspect ratios . We’ve already seen hints that Google has big plans for the tool, like integrating Nano Banana with Search AI Mode , and today we’re looking into a few more places where Nano Banana appears to be getting ready to make an appearance.

From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home.

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update is expected to include a new automatic call screening feature. Previously leaked code suggests that the feature will enable an AI assistant to answer and transcribe calls automatically. New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. One UI 8.5 is destined to be the next big update for Galaxy phones and tablets, and it will be a bigger deal than One UI 8. Leaks suggest that Samsung will reserve most of its newer features and bigger changes for this x.5 release. We have also found out that One UI 8.5 will be based on Android 16 QPR2 , which will also bring all the new QPR features to Samsung’s devices. We’ve also spotted that automatic call screening is coming to Galaxy phones , and it seems Samsung still has more improvements in the pipeline for this feature.

As the competition over wireless customers continues to heat up between the big three, we’ve seen T-Mobile begin to outshine its competitors in some ways. To combat this, Verizon and AT&amp;T are both working hard to win new users.

Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance.

It’s new AI-powered “Bring your bill” tool analyzes rival bills and applies comparable pricing and promotional credits to match or beat them. The matched rates are locked for 36 months, but prices will rise afterward, making it a short-term value play rather than a permanent discount. Verizon has a well-earned reputation for solid network performance, but at a much higher price than the competition. Over the last few years, this has changed a bit as T-Mobile has become a major leader in 5G and beyond. The truth is that all three major carriers now offer fairly similar features and performance overall, though it ultimately depends on where you live. What really sets carriers the most is quickly becoming price and value. That’s not an area that Big Red usually excels at, but with its newest promotion , it’s promising to get more competitive here than ever before. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A decade and a half later, I consciously stick to Android phones.

More than just nightmare fuel, the incident highlights a design flaw across the entire industry. Smart rings, for all their promise, lack an emergency exit. Trapped by my own tech Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority Unlike watches or bands, rings don’t unbuckle (or un-Velcro) for easy removal. They only come off the way they go on: sliding past knuckles. If a finger swells, whether from heat, hydration, or a malfunctioning battery, the device can quickly become a vise. In the case of one unlucky Galaxy Ring user , battery swelling turned a well-fitting device into a finger trap, grounding his flight plans and sending him to the ER. The fear of having a ring of any kind stuck on my finger is very real. That’s exactly what happened to tech creator Daniel (@ZONEofTECH).

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
