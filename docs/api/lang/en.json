If my memory serves me right, it was around 11 years ago that we first entered the PC market with Yakuza 0,\" recalled Yokoyama. \"Until then, we had only released our games on PlayStation, and they were exclusively in Japanese, made specifically for the Japanese market. \"The Yakuza series itself was originally created with the concept of 'Japanese people making a game for Japanese people,' so we never imagined it would be accepted globally. But once we properly localized the language and created an environment where players around the world could enjoy it, the PC market embraced it in a big way. That acceptance helped our studio grow and pushed us toward globalization.\" Yakuza 0 on PC was certainly my introduction to the series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio finally bridged that gap with some of its finest work.

Tom's Hardware spotted numerous eBay listings for the Xbox Ally X priced as high as $2,500. For context, the MSRP is $999 for the Xbox Ally X or $599 for the base Xbox Ally. Both devices are set to launch on October 16. If you want to snag a Xbox Ally, it's best to avoid eBay entirely. At the time of writing, pre-orders are still open for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X at Best Buy , Asus , and Microsoft (if you're outside the US, you can check the official Xbox pre-order page to find pre-order options in your region). This is a pretty pricey handheld as it is, all things considered, so don't let a scalper trick you into paying double.

A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything.” Both Final Fantasy 16 and 7: Rebirth underperformed in sales according to a May 2024 internal report that was made public last September. Notably, the report was written before either game got its eventual PC port. FF16 came to PC in September 2024, 15 months after PS5, and Rebirth in January 2025, just under a year out from PS5. Square Enix is one of the only non-first party companies to still do this, and unlike Rockstar, no longer commands the kind of universal, \"drop …",

Does this seem like a fun or even reasonable way to play Silksong? Not at all. The toughest Hollow Knight bosses are finely tuned bullet hell puzzles demanding precise play. Doubling all those projectiles looks like it turns the game into pure chaos. Even legendarily tough videogame duo bosses like Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls are balanced with the numbers advantage in mind, all but doing the martial arts movie thing where the goons only go at the hero one at a time. Skong Boss Doubler has no such concessions to fun play, it's just \"There are two Last Judges now. Good luck. Champions adjust.\" But it's a really, really funny bit, part of the back and forth conversation between players, modders, and memers over this game.

So, while things might get off to a rocky start, issues will get smoothed out as those ideas are refined. As reported by GamesRadar , in an interview with Edge Magazine, 2XKO director Shaun Rivera commented on Riot's hopes (and fears) for the game, stating, \"We're the type of team where we want to try stuff. Sometimes it's going to land and sometimes it's going to whiff, but we will be trying things. I want to set those expectations for players that something we try might go wrong or it might not be good, but we'll address it.\" Rivera also noted that \"it's going to be a little bumpy when we get out,\" although that's to be expected with any early access game. Even if 2XKO wasn't in early access, though, Rivera makes the case for a little leeway, adding, \"I do want to call out, though, that we're a team of people making a fighting game for the first time in a sense, and we don't have …",

He went on to add that, \"Technology and console aside, our workflows and the way we built our worlds throughout each iteration, for Forza Horizon 6 [we took] lots of learnings from past games.\" One of the \"past games\" that influenced Horizon 6 most was (somewhat surprisingly) the Hot Wheels DLC for Horizon 5, as Arceta explained: \"We actually developed a new way to create those orange tracks that go around the road to get the best quality and have it be authentic [to Hot Wheels].

People at the show were lucky enough to get hands on with Fambotic, a cozy farming sim with adorable robot companions. For those of us at home, the trailer in our Tokyo Direct still gives a good glimpse at what it's all about. For your viewing pleasure, we've got the zombie carnage of Killing Floor 3, the cartoonish and charmingly British Earth Must Die, and one of the coolest games we've ever seen, Tenshattack, where you play as a train carriage that's also the best skateboarder in the world. If you want to rewatch the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct in f…",

Don't Lie was shown off for the first time during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, and the trailer gave me chills. Junko is a \"hikikomori,\" someone who secludes themself at home, away from the outside world. Following a therapeutic program, Junko finds herself alone again, desperately trying to reconnect with two of the people she met during the process. One is Shinji, the protagonist of Don't Watch. The game is all first-person, and you'll venture throughout Juno's apartment and her own, crumbling psyche which is conjuring up liminal spaces and terrifying hallucinations. The trailer shows off the mix of hyper realistic interiors like swimming pools and hallways covered in notes, as well as a scary, eye-covered monster inspired by the Dodomeki, a Japanese folklore spirit. There are so, so many eyes. To contrast the scares is a fully-playable versi…",

Part of that I attribute to its original fantasy world where it feels like the devs, unshackled by the aesthetic constraints of a 20-year-old series, were able to make something far more grandiose than grimy streetfights. Who better, then, to bang out the soundtrack than Yuka Kitamura, mastermind behind the tunes of Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice? A studio recording was revealed during today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, interspersed with some new clips of the game's combat. It's all snarling strings and portentous vocal melodies, and given that it's performed by a live orchestra, it's a level of production value the sidescrolling beat 'em up is treated to less often than I'd like. Stylistically, it's perfect for what you'd expect from musical backing in a fantasy videogame. The boss footage is no slouch either, and only ma…",

Also clock that style meter in the top right; this is a game that takes after Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. The triple threat character setup means you can launch an enemy into the air with one character, switch to another, and send them crashing back down in a matter of seconds.

You'll meet Tea Practitioner Nami, a white cat called Taiko, and a disgruntled fisherman. The gang's all here. You play as a monk who can literally ride the wind, using the clouds as platforms to walk on or skimming across the water gracefully. Meeting a talking cat doesn't seem so farfetched now. We also see more of the poem-making in action. You'll get to craft haikus based on the environment around you. So, when you encounter the fisherman, you can try to cheer him up by choosing from a list of words you've gathered and making the best verse you can think of.

One mysterious figure has dark antlers and eyes filled in white, another's face is wrapped up in a head scarf, with only a long eyelash and serpentine eye exposed, and another is some sort of mouse mage. As well as richly-colored landscapes and locales, we get a look at the action-heavy combat, too. Our hero can rapidly dodge out of the way of incoming attacks and deliver their own flurry of deadly follow-up strikes. The enemies look like a real challenge.

If you've seen the trailer for Join Us, the co-op (or singleplayer) open world survival sandbox Wolf Haus Games revealed today at the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, you probably have a few questions. I sure did after watching events in the trailer escalate from typical survival activities like farming and base-building to visions far more perplexing, like a tie-dyed bus with multiple laser-sighted heavy machine guns on the roof and a towering squid monster invading our planet from dimensions unknown. There was also a man riding a pig. You don't see that every day. I couldn't just walk away from a trailer like that, so I talked to Joe Dietsch, co-founder and CEO of developer Wolf Haus Games, to get a few more details about Join Us. According to Dietsch, in Join Us you're sent by an \"omnipresent cult leader\" into a rural area of the country, and \"it's your job to essentially start a new franchise there. You can kind of think of it like you're franchising a Burger King. There's the HQ, but you're being sent out to start your own version of this cult in a new environment.\" Once the…",

Of course, you don't play as the cult's true head honcho in Join Us; you're a franchise owner of sorts, building a personalized wing of a much larger doomsday cult in the rural United States. You'll build a remote compound, conceal yourself from local scrutiny, and recruit the psychologically vulnerable who you can detect with target-highlighting \"leader vision.\" It's like Batman's detective sight from the Arkham games, but for emotional manipulation.

You can then replay that movement, allowing the protagonist to, in the first example, cross a large gap by first recording themselves walk the length of the gap on a flat surface. But that's not all this power is good for. If there's a wall that's too high to jump over but you went up an elevator nearby, just record your motion in there and you'll simply float above the obstacle. I'm sure there are a huge number of platforming puzzles that can be created with a clever system like this. If you're on a spinning platform you can record a circle, or if you do a series of jumps you can dart around obstacles in the air without a care in the world.

The twist is that it also throws in co-op and some mechanical elements à la Satisfactory.

It's also got a charming '70s and '90s retro-futuristic style, and gives the bots some sweet bunny ears.

This thing even has a quad barrel attachment, which reminds me of the shotgun in Bulletstorm. Next is the MKR-350 Assault Rifle, which looks awesome when you start modifying it and adding all the attachments. It appears to be a solid all-rounder: real bread and butter weaponry that should be useful just about anywhere. Finally, the M14 EBR MOD 0.

During today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, we got a new look at Gravebound, an upcoming third-person extraction shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world where glowing numbers do indeed pop out of your targets. This is a PvEvP experience, so you'll have to contend with deadly robots as well as other players going after the same loot you are. There's some bullet hell-style chaos here. One of the enemies fires streams of creeping, malevolent orbs as well as missile-like projectiles that shoot straight up in the air before heading right for you on a diagonal. I might have to bust out the protractor to avoid getting hit. We also see an arena where circles of electricity force you to dance around them lest you get zapped. Luckily, you have a variety of weapons to deal with these foes: From shotguns and sniper rifles—where each pellet causes its own number to pop up above an enemy's head, fantastic—to assault rifles and pistols. There's a free public play test for Gravebound that starts right now. So,…",

Kiwami 3 isn't like the other remakes of the older games in the series, according to Yokoyama, who we spoke to during a visit to RGG headquarters in Japan. \"Instead of simply adding mini-games or extra story content, we've added an entirely new, standalone game called Dark Ties,\" he said. \"This allows players to experience the story from a completely new perspective as a different protagonist.\" Dark Ties is included with Yakuza Kiwami 3, and stars Yoshitaka Mine, a character from Yakuza 3 who was once a businessman but has turned to a life of crime.

We do, however, have an explanation from Rockstar's cofounder as to why Bully 2 never saw the light of day. Speaking to IGN at LA Comic Con (via Eurogamer ), Dan Houser explained that the project ended prematurely due to a lack of \"bandwidth\" among Rockstar management. \"I think it was just bandwidth issues, Houser told IGN. \"You know, if you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want.\" It's a fairly broad explanation, but it falls roughly in line with previously stated reasons for Bully 2's.

Billie can fly on a broomstick just like a witch, and can use an umbrella to glide gracefully like Mary Poppins. But that's not all, she can run along walls as though she's the Prince of Persia, and uses an assortment of gadgets to get through each level, like bombs, swords, and some sort of projectile launcher—it looks like the umbrella refashioned to shoot gusts of compressed air. There's still more. Billie can also turn invisible and slide around on water by turning it to ice right as she steps on it. I'm excited to see what kind of platforming challenges will be on offer.

Indeed, Awaysis looks like a souped-up classic Zelda but it plays a bit like Gang Beasts or Human Fall Flat in that physics are everything. In its latest trailer, which popped up at today's PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct, there's a detailed look at how ramps, concaves, and half-pipes in the environment cause players to slow down, speed up, and fly to ludicrous heights like they're marbles in a miniature skate park. When the game first debuted , developer 17-bit described both Gang Beasts and pinball as inspirations, but it's a little hard to conceptualize until you see it in action.

One of these is a timid squirrel that Moomintroll finds scurrying about in the attic. As we see during the trailer above, he runs out into the frosty world, following the squirrel's tracks and telling them it's okay to stay inside where it's nice and warm. I love the art style—it looks like you're playing through an old Disney movie like 101 Dalmatians or Bambi.
