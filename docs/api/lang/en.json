    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Elon Musk’s SpaceX may build its own phone with satellite internet connectivity. The company is reportedly looking to expand to other products, including mobile devices. The device may differ from traditional smartphones, but details on that are currently limited. Elon Musk’s SpaceX recently acquired xAI , making it the highest-valued private company yet. But the rocket maker does not want to stop there, and is now exploring other markets for products even loosely related to space. After dominating satellite-based internet and direct-to-cell services with its Starlink venture, SpaceX may expand into making its own smartphones, Reuters reported earlier today. The phone could feature built-in hardware to use Starlink’s internet services, offer direct device-to-device connectivity, and support SpaceX’s recently launched Stargaze space-tracking service.",

The strategy mirrors Samsung’s traditional pre-order perks, though it’s unclear whether this offer will expand to the US. Google officially confirmed the Pixel 10a will launch on February 18, with pre-orders beginning the same day. Google has finally confirmed that the Pixel 10a will launch on February 18 . We’ve seen plenty of leaks around the phone’s design and even its price , but Google has yet to share final pricing information. Now, one retailer has gone ahead and rolled out a pre-release deal for the Pixel 10a, one that Samsung usually reserves for its Galaxy S-series launches (but may, ironically, cut back with the Galaxy S26 series).

The changes include new settings to customize the frame’s thickness, curvature, and color. It also organizes the editor’s options using a cleaner interface. I don’t know about you, but for me, Google Photos is the closest thing to a digital time capsule . I’ve used it to back up my photos longer than any social media app has, and I expect to do so until Google lets the app live. Besides automatically generated memories, you can also revisit memories by creating collages within the Photos app. But if you use the built-in Collage Editor in Photos, you might find it limiting compared to other third-party apps. Thankfully, Google is now testing new features that let you tweak collages to your taste and keep you from having to look for alternatives .

    "body": "Credit: YouTube TL;DR A few hours from release, MANGMI has added free microswitch modules for early buyers of the Pocket Max handheld. The device features a 7-inch OLED screen, Snapdragon 865, and swappable control modules. Super Early Bird pricing is $199, but it faces stiff competition from the AYN Odin 2 Portal. MANGMI is less than a day away from launching the cheapest 7-inch gaming handheld on the market, the Pocket Max , but the deal just became a little sweeter. Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

Tips about upcoming smartphones can turn up anywhere, and as we try to sort through all the rumors and theories surrounding upcoming devices, that can often mean looking at tips that don’t originate in a language we natively speak.

In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI.

The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets. With the proliferation of specialist handhelds and more powerful gaming phones, compact Android gaming tablets don’t come around very often these days. However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes. In the accompanying text, Lenovo refers to the device as the “Lenovo AI Tablet Legion Y700,” with the AI part feeling almost obligatory in 2026.

YouTube attracts creators from all around the world, and while that means there’s almost always going to be some great new content out there that’s targeted at you, it sucks when the video you most want to watch isn’t available in your language. Google’s been working hard for years to break down those kind of barriers, though, most recently introducing automatic dubbing into multiple languages.

This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks. While Project Astra is still under development, we’re seeing evidence detailing some of its aspects. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

How many smartphone brands will be left by the end of 2026?

It’s almost enough to make you think there won’t be anyone left but Samsung and Apple before you know it. And as we wait to see what fate has in store for these companies, we’re getting some small reassurance that at least one minor player intends to keep going with new phones.

    "body": "TL;DR Some Android Auto users report Google Maps losing the car icon when switching back to split-screen mode. Navigation still works, but the car marker disappears until Maps is force-closed on the phone. Several users say switching back to the default blue arrow icon may stop the issue, at least for now. Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

It topped charts, with average peak speeds of 260Mbps overall and 310Mbps on 5G, while Verizon could only achieve 130Mbps. T-Mobile also ranked first in consistency and reliability, as per the report. Ookla, the company behind the iconic Speedtest.net, has released fresh insights about the leading carriers in the US based on their network speeds. According to this report, T-Mobile has emerged as the top service provider for the second half of 2025, with the highest download speeds. It repeats this feat after being established as the fastest carrier in the first half of 2025 as well. This report, according to Ookla, is based on speed tests performed by millions of users across the US. According to Ookla’s findings, T-Mobile’s average network speed stood at roughly 260Mbps, while its average 5G speed was nearly 310Mbps. Verizon, on the other hand, only recorded an average top speed of about 130Mbps, less than half of T-Mobile’s.",

The technology could debut on the OPPO Find X10 series and the photography-focused HUAWEI Nova 16 series, scheduled for launch later this year or early next year. A square sensor allows users to take landscape or portrait selfies without physically rotating the phone by cropping into the sensor. One of the most underrated upgrades on the iPhone 17 series is the new 18MP “Center Stage” front camera. While the camera itself is great, the party trick is that it uses a square sensor. This allows users to take selfies in landscape and portrait orientations without physically rotating their phone, as the company crops into the sensor for the shot. Android users could soon join in on the fun, as Android brands have started exploring a square selfie camera for their upcoming phones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

    "body": "TL;DR Users on Reddit report that apps previously accessible on their Nest Hub displays have disappeared without explanation. Similar reports have been going around for years, but it seems that more users lost access to apps this week. We’re not sure what’s causing this. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Update: February 2, 2026 (3:37 PM ET): Shortly after we initially published our coverage of this Nest Hub app issue, Google shared a message in the original Reddit thread, acknowledging the problem and stating that work was underway on a fix. Over the weekend, Google followed that message up with the announcement that the missing-app problem was now resolved. We can confirm that everything seems back to normal on our own displays.",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year Google started supporting a landscape mode UI for its Phone app. Eventually a new option to lock the app in portrait arrived for beta testers. That setting is now broadly available, as Google addresses confusion surrounding the feature. The software on our phones is constantly being updated, so we’re well aware that the appearance and functionality of apps can change on even a day-to-day basis. But last year, Android users found themselves scratching their heads about one change in particular: Google’s Phone app adding support for a landscape-style interface . Was it a bug? Was it a feature? Who was even asking for this in the first place? After a few bumpy months, it now looks like we’re finally at the end of this weird saga.
