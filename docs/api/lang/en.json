The official announcement is yet to come, which should provide clarity on which models will gain access to the Android 16-based update first. Nothing OS 4.0 includes new features that leverage AI and other content, like the controversial Lock Glimpse feature. Android 16 publicly debuted in June, but Nothing users have been patiently waiting for their version of the latest release for months. Nothing is laser-focused on making AI features a core part of its operating system, whether it be an Android derivative or a future fully-custom OS . After the long wait, Nothing announced the Nothing OS 4.0 open beta in late October, which allowed users to finally test the Android 16-based update. Now, the company is confirming exactly when Nothing phone owners will get public access to Nothing OS 4.0. In a post on the Nothing Community site, Nothing confirmed the official announcement and rollout for Nothing OS 4.0 will begin this Friday, November 21. “We know you have been eagerly waiting for the general release and want to say a special thank you to our Beta testers for prov…",

    "body": "TL;DR The Abxylute 3D One is a new gaming handheld with an 11-inch glasses-free 3D screen. It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

Samsung and major carriers in the region have urged consumers to update their phones or replace them. An Australian citizen recently lost their life after being unable to call 000, Australia’s national emergency service line, on their old Samsung phone . The deceased was a customer of Lebara, a carrier that’s part of Australia’s TPG Telecom Limited and operates on Vodafone’s network in the region, and was unable to call Triple Zero despite having an active service. TPG informed the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) that the incident occurred on November 13 and that no network outage was detected at the time.

The charging case may also include speakers similar to Apple’s AirPods cases for sound-based locator features. We’ve shared plenty of information already about the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro , which is expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year. Thanks to our leaked renders, we have a good idea of what the earbuds will look like in both white and black colors. We are also aware of new features, such as Head Gestures, that could potentially delight Samsung fans. We’ve now spotted one more new feature coming to the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, which could allow users to easily locate their phone with the click of a button.

Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 .

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment. Of course, I have a thermometer with me at al…",

Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini overlays have been two remarkable ways to let Gemini view content from other apps. But their application remains limited since the overlay closes as soon as we switch back to the other app. The other alternative is to share your screen with Gemini Live , but that may not match the regular interface in terms of functionality. Now, Google may be working to partially solve that by allowing Gemini to interpret another app’s content, though the application may be limited to a specific set of devices.

In simpler terms, your employer will now be able to read your RCS chats in Google Messages despite end-to-end encryption. Encryption will still work when messages are traveling between devices, but employers will be able to use common archival apps to keep a record of RCS messages for legal and compliance purposes. Google says employees will see a notification when archival is active on their phones. Google is rolling out a new RCS message archival feature for fully managed Pixel phones. The system is designed to help companies comply with strict rules around record-keeping and legal requests for employee communication.

You can find the best and worst days and times to shop based on your US state, giving you the inside scoop on holiday prep. The secret is to run errands on Tuesday afternoons, as that’s when shops and post offices are often less crowded. The holidays bring time off work and connection with friends and family, but they also come with travel, traffic, and plenty of errands. Thanksgiving is the most-traveled holiday in the US, with over 80 million people expected to hit the roads, board trains, and fly on planes this coming week. After that, December holidays lead right into the new year. To help you ace your holiday travel and preparations, Google is sharing a few tips based on Google Maps data to save you time while avoiding traffic. Thanksgiving is first, so let’s start there. Traffic is 14% more congested than usual between 10 AM and 4 PM the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which falls on November 27 this year.

The Translate app may gain a persistent notification, allowing you to continue using Live Translate even if you switch to a different app. Google also appears to be prepping for Live Translate on XR glasses. In August, Google rolled out an update to the Translate app that introduced Live Translation. Powered by Gemini, this feature allows you to have a real-time back-and-forth conversation with others in a different language. Not only are your words converted into another language on screen, but you can also turn on audio playback to hear the translation spoken out loud.

Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",

Completing focus sessions rewards you with virtual items that can be used to decorate your avatar’s room. Meanwhile, Pokemon TCG Pocket was the best overall game in 2025. The game, which actually launched in October 2024, is a virtual take on the Pokemon card game.",

Smart rings may be one of the trendiest fitness tracking form factors of the moment, but one company is making the case that health tracking belongs on your ear. Lumia today announced Lumia 2, a smart earring that tracks blood flow to your head in real time. According to the company, the device offers insight into energy, focus, and mental clarity. It’s a bold pitch for what Lumia calls the “world’s first smart earrings,” but it’s also one built on clinical roots rather than consumer fashion. Lumia originally developed its sensing tech alongside researchers at Johns Hopkins, Duke, and Harvard to help patients with chronic blood-flow disorders. Now, the company wants to make that same technology more accessible by packaging it inside a jewelry-like earring back it calls the Lumia Core.

If you want to go a step further, lock your phone away. The advice always sounds great until you actually try living with it. For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world. We need maps, banking, authentication , messaging, and the small conveniences that make everyday life function smoothly. That tension between wanting less and needing enough is where most of these experiments fall apart. At least they do for me.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting. That means you don’t have to worry about shooting in portrait or landscape mode and can defer the decision until you edit the clips.",

However, OnePlus made no mention of the phone, besides briefly stating it would be “coming soon.” Fortunately, the company has now begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, which is likely to raise our expectations for a launch soon. OnePlus’ sites for the UK and India have already begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, showcasing a silhouette of the upcoming phone.

It’s believed this move is meant to improve profitability, suggesting that these savings won’t be passed on to consumers. Samsung is also tipped to release an Exynos-powered Galaxy S26 in Asia. Recent leaks suggest that Samsung will use Exynos or Snapdragon silicon in the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus, depending on the region. Now, another source has chimed in, while adding more details. Chosun Biz (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Exynos 2600-equipped Galaxy S26 will primarily be sold in Asia, including Korea. This comes after ET News reported last week that the S26 and S26 Plus will receive Exynos power in Korea and Europe, but Snapdragon silicon in North America. ET News added that the S26 Ultra will be equipped with a Snapdragon chip globally.",

Google also said AI Mode will eventually be able to find flight and hotel reservations, but didn’t share when that’ll be. Google’s AI Mode is rolling out a flashy Labs feature more broadly. Starting soon, all users will be able to ask AI Mode to both find restaurants that meet certain criteria and to find reservations at those restaurants, without having to sign up for any betas or experiments. AI Mode has had an ongoing agentic experiment you could opt into to let the search engine look for appointments and event tickets on your behalf. Google’s shared that, starting next week, AI Mode’s ability to hunt down reservations at restaurants is graduating from experiment status and will be available for everyone.",

With Canvas, you can now ask specific questions and improve results to suit your budget or other preferences. Meanwhile, Google is also expanding its AI-powered flights tool, called Flight Deals, globally. Google is continually improving the AI-powered Search experience to make it one of the few apps you use, whether for homework, shopping, or everyday searching. Earlier this month, we learned that the AI Mode in Search is getting better at helping you choose the proper attire for the upcoming holiday season . Now, Google is adding more features that will simplify planning your vacation. In July, Google introduced Gemini’s Canvas feature to AI Mode in Search. This update was primarily aimed at helping students study more effectively, where the Canvas would allow them to seek detailed responses on specific aspects of the initial result. Now, Canvas in AI Mode is being expanded to help travelers make better itineraries.",
