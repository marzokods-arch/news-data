This (up to) 27-item bundle from Magpie Games contains a couple of other solid systems, too—Avatar Legends (based off Avatar: The Last Airbender) and Root: The Roleplaying Game are included, alongside the gothic horror TTRPG Bluebeard's Pride—which sees players acting out different aspects of a newly wed's psyche as she uncovers the misdeeds of her new captor. I cannot recommend Masks enough. I kid you not, I am literally going to be playing my regular Tuesday game this evening. It's the third Masks campaign I've played with this group, in which I'm an Outsider who's starting to properly unravel her feelings about her people's past attempts to conquer Earth (they're aliens in a comic book, so they did a pretty bad job of it). Unravelling feelings is what the entire system's about, really. Masks is all about writing a comic book with your friends, rather than dealing 70 d…",

A simple enough concept, but let's just say this one spiralled a bit. And then some. This incredible desk contains 74 hexagonal frames, 44 of which house 37 active RGB cells. Each multi-layered cell can display its status via perspex inserts and multiple LEDs (via Hackaday ). Between the cells are pathways along which the bees travel, again with RGB lights. All told, there are 3,745 LEDs. It's all controlled by software that Full Stack Woodworking also built. And the resulting bee hive simulation is utterly beguiling. But hold that thought, because this labour of love deserves describing. This is a hugely complex desk build. Just making the top layer of the cell frames from African hard wood was an incredibly involved process, requiring several steps to prepare uniformly thin strips of wood ready to be laser cut. Full Stack Woodworking worked three sessions a day making the top hex frame layer—before work, after work, and before bed. And it took 25 days to …",

Earlier this year it released its ninth expansion, Grasping Fortune, and now it's gearing up for number 10: Poison Song . This is a big one. Well, they're all big ones, but this is a big one for a new reason . Poison Song means players are finally getting \"one of the holy grails that TR players [have] been waiting for more than twenty years—the ability to join House Indoril.\" This is either the most hype-inducing sentence you've ever heard, or completely meaningless (if you are normal), so let me try to break it down. Base Morrowind let you join any of three different Houses—Morrowind-native political factions that, conveniently, pretty much mapped to each corner of the Fighter-Mage-Thief triad. There was Hlaalu, the Empire-sympathetic merchant guild; Redoran, the traditionalist fighter sect; and Telvanni, dickhead wizards who live in mushrooms.

Taro was shown an image of a signed copy of the Nier Reincarnation OST being sold on Vinted, a site typically used for more noble purposes, like reselling clothes or old books. Mind, flogging a signed something-or-other isn't inherently scummy (times are tough!) but what isn't great is faking the signature entirely. \"This autograph is a fake. I include small unknown features in my real autographs to prevent reselling, so I can tell when one isn’t genuine,\" Taro says, before adding that \"I've confirmed that nearly half of the autographs being resold are actually fake, so please don't buy them.\" Oof. This has naturally led to a flurry of people asking whether or not their autographs are genuine, or sharing genuine ones—which sort of defeats the point, though I imagine ol' Taro switches it up from time to time.

Though the 8BitDo Retro R8 owes arguably both its greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses to that commitment. The version I have my hands on is the N edition. Based on an old school Nintendo Entertainment System (NES, to you and me), it's covered in a pale, warm-toned grey colouring, punctuated with a smattering of reds and blacks, plus grey on the base. It's perhaps the most interesting-looking mouse I've tested in years, and the same can be said about the translucent green Xbox edition . The second you pick up this mouse, you will feel every one of its singular design choices. The ends are angular, rather than the grooves we've come to expect from most mice, and the left and right side-buttons are recessed into the frame of the mouse itself. That means you have to get leverage over the opposite side of the mouse to get enough space to jam your finger in. These side buttons …",

But that doesn't mean I'm not excited for Ten++, which is a sizeable new update adding even more levels I doubt I'll ever finish. The free update includes new levels for the solo, multiplayer and race modes, as well as six new color schemes and \"a few assorted bugfixes\".

Our Fraser's already played it and found that, while it might not be the RPG its ancestor was, it's still a rollocking vamp story. Bloodlines 2 is due out October 21, and you'll have to wait for its full launch to actually play. No advanced or early access here, folks. In fact, not even much in the way of pre-order DLC since Paradox sheepishly folded the Toreador and Lasombra clans into the base game. Still, if you just… love spending money, there's still a little time to preorder and get a \"Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox\" for your haven. To be fair, the Bloodlines 1 OST does rip, but I'm not entirely sure it rips hard enough to get me to pre-order a game.

I have found why. Turn Uniform Infantry Aiming Off, scroll down to find zoom sensitivity smoothing, turn that off. Go back to Uniform Infantry Aiming, turn it back on & put the coefficient at 0!\" I wouldn't say my aim has felt off in Battlefield 6 so far, but I went ahead and tried Torbis' tweaks to see if I noticed any immediate difference. The verdict? Yep, ADS aiming on mouse does feel more precise now, though I'm not sure all the tweaks listed are actually necessary.

Since then, the ministry says that the NSA used 42 types of \"special cyberattack weapons\" to disrupt the internal network systems, and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024—although no evidence was provided in the post to backup these claims. \"The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself,\" the post continues. \"Repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats.\" After discovering the breach, the min…",

After adding 15 new cards in September's The Lost Arsenal update , the game continues to deliver on its promised roadmap. The second payload of post-launch content is called Echoes From the Void, and it will be arriving November 5. I spoke with Shiny Shoe game designer Colin Krausnick about the two new bosses arriving in the update, what new artifacts are on the way, and how these new threats will complicate existing strategies. Main things to know about this update: Echoes From the Void is introducing two new bosses: The Fleshweaver, and Stryx and Hallow Echoes From the Void is releasing Nov 5, for free The Fleshweaver becomes an alternate boss for Arkion, in Ring 3 Shiny Shoe says: \"When Fleshweaver is attacked, it creates a Fleshling minion in the train on the current floor and loses one stack of Mass.

Arc Raiders pulled in a peak concurrent player count of 189,668. That makes it Steam's 89th most-played game by concurrent players, per the keepers of the scrolls over at SteamDB . It's ahead of GTA 5 Enhanced, Dune: Awakening, and Football Manager 2020, and just a hair off the personal records of Warframe and Stellar Blade. It's worth nothing that the game hit its peak pretty early in the server test, mind you. Right as things picked up, we brought you news that the game had slipped just part 185,000 players. The mathletes among you will note that 189,668 isn't too much more than that, and indeed the game reached that peak on the first day of the Server Slam.

Speaking to Variety , Xbox president Sarah Bond says that you can blame Asus for that one, as the pricing was based on its feedback. \"We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware,\" said Bond. \"That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices. \"I feel really good about the value that we're giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware.\" It's been well-received by reviewers overall, that's for sure.

It's a list designed to represent the passion of our global team of over 30 writers and editors. If you're wondering why Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is back on the list for the first time in years, it's because Josh made a fully animated powerpoint presentation that he delivered to the team while dressed up as a pirate. Not everyone went to those lengths to advocate for their chosen favourites, but you can be sure every pick is a game that at least a few people on staff care deeply about. As always, the key question when creating a list of the best games is: What does it mean to be the 'best'? Is it a canon classic—a game that can't be ignored for its legacy to all of PC gaming? Is it an original idea, offering up something that's never been seen before? Or, more simply, is it a finely crafted masterpiece—the pinnacle of its chosen genre?

The momentous news came, appropriately enough, alongside a shot of Liu and his own sleepy dog, though the shot of the script itself had the writer's name cunningly edited out. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for this project, based on—if you've somehow forgotten—2012's open world crime game of the year. The film was originally announced back in 2017, with Donnie Yen set to star. Then things went quiet until Yen himself said it had been canned earlier this year. That's when Liu entered to take up the banner. The rights to Sleeping Dogs belong to the game's publisher, Square Enix. You might reasonably think, with Square Enix being kind of weird about its properties in general, that it might bear some responsibility for the movie's rocky road so far.

The announcement trailer, shown above, starts with a direct trailer for the TV show before cutting to executive producer at Marvel games Danny Koo and head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios Brad Winderbaum. It's a very 'we are reading a press release off a teleprompter' video, but it did reveal some key details about the upcoming mode. Players will get to hop in as Thor, Magik, Blade, the Punisher, and—Jeff the Shark. One of these things is not like the others, though I'm personally very excited to see that cute little guy chew through hordes of the undead. This also implies that Jeff is somehow immune to the Hunger, which is concerning. Maybe he only wants to eat other sharks. Trying to stop them from protecting their limbs are, well, the zombies—but also boss battles, like undead Namor and the \"Queen of the Dead\", which appears to also be …",

Benzies was one of the key leadership figures that had overseen GTA's rise from a pioneering open world romp into a global cultural phenomenon, and Barb's first big project was supposed to be Everywhere: a multiplayer RPG in a futuristic open world where, ultimately, players would be able to author their own experiences. Everywhere was hugely ambitious and backed by the staggering sums that Benzies' reputation could attract: Barb had raised £233 million by 2024, and by the end of that year boasted 448 staff. But it didn't have a game it could release and, with Everywhere's ambitious scope, a decision was made at some point to shift focus to MindsEye, which had begun as an in-game experience that was part of Everywhere. MindsEye released in June this year and has been a disaster. Within weeks of the game's launch there was news of mass layoffs at Barb, the true scale of which is only now becoming clear. Earlier this month a scathing open letter was signed by 93 former Barb employees , allegin…",

That's not because it's not worth the $150 asking fee, but that, in the months I've been watching its stock, it has sold for $100 / $110 almost as much as it has $150. Though it's not on sale right now, I've seen it discounted at both Amazon and Best Buy multiple times over the last few months. At this price point, I can't recommend a single 4K webcam on the market over this one, assuming you'll actually get the use out of 4K. 4K is still a bit of a niche even now. Some software doesn't support it, and others (like Discord) require you to have access to a subscription for 4K webcam streaming. Even if your software supports 4K resolution, a small cam on top of a stream on Twitch or YouTube generally won't justify such a high resolution. When some 4K webcams cost upwards of $200, that extra cash never feels worth it for my use cases. However, down to $100, it makes a lot more sense, and isn't too far from the prices of standard 1080p webcams. With its look and price point, the Insta360 Link 2C is a natural competitor to the Obsbot Meet 2 , which is still the cutest webcam I've ever used, almost a year after first using …",

The long-running answer has been to try out DOSBox and its modern \"forks,\" or modified versions, but it can be a bit of a pain to get started if you're new to emulation. Enter DOSBox Pure , once an impressive core for the open-source emulation frontend RetroArch—if that sounds like gibberish, it just means you go outside enough—now a standalone app that can easily load ZIP files, mounted CD and floppy disk images, DOS exes, and so on. It's a pay-what-you-want download on developer Schelling 's itch.io page, and after giving it a quick look myself, the app is slick and straightforward right out of the box. There's step-by-step use instructions on that page as well if you have any trouble getting your games running⁠—you'll have to bring your own files, with storefronts like GOG being one potential source. From there it's got plenty of modern settings to tweak and soup up your DOS games of choice: rebi…",

Microsoft has already recognized the union. The CWA shared quotes from various developers supporting the motion in its announcement. Game designer on the Hearthstone team and organizing committee member Dominic Calkosz said, \"My coworkers, as individuals, have voiced many concerns over the years, but it is easy for any company to ignore individuals. \"We chose to organize in pursuit of a collective voice and a force of solidarity that the industry cannot ignore.\" Another committee member and QA analyst Carol Blean stated in the same post, \"I support our union because we deserve to be heard and respected … Real solutio…",

Two heavy hitters—the reboot of Bungie's venerable shooter Marathon and Embark's fresh up-and-comer Arc Raiders —are nearly here, and both have had a chance to gear up with playtests. Speaking with PC Gamer US editor-in-chief Tyler Wilde, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins said the shared timing made for a fortuitous opportunity. \"It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen,\" Watkins said. \"It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.\" Of course, Arc Raiders and Marathon are different games, but it's hard not to compare the two. Timing aside, when PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park played both back-to-back earlier this year, he noted \"both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit,\" adding he was \"skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.\" For Watki…",

If you long for the simpler times back when enemies just smoked you and got it over with, you might take a shine to Classicvania and Zelda-inspired adventure game Mina the Hollower , the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games.
