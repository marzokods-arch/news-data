Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has recorded the sounds of electrical discharges —sparks — and mini-sonic booms in dust devils on Mars. Long theorized, the phenomenon has now been confirmed through audio and electromagnetic recordings captured by the rover’s SuperCam microphone. The discovery, published Nov. 26 in the journal Nature, has implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, and habitability, and could help inform the design of future robotic and human missions to Mars. A frequent occurrence on the Red Planet, dust devils form from rising and rotating columns of warm air. Air near the planet’s surface b…",

You’re encouraged to share your stats with others to get a bonus. If you don’t see the Year in Review yet, try updating the app. Duolingo has started rolling out its 2025 Year in Review, giving you a tidy summary of how much you’ve used the app this year. Mine just appeared, and while my stats prove how much time I invest in the app, I’m far from fluent in my chosen language, so it’s also a reminder that Duolingo can be more about engagement than learning . The company hasn’t made a big announcement this time around, but its campaigns page now reads: “Year in Review 2025 is here. What did you achieve?” and reminds you that you may need to update the app before the recap shows up.",

Lee and the PHANGS-HST Team This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the spiral galaxy NGC 4535, which is situated about 50 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo (the Maiden). Through a small telescope, this galaxy appears extremely faint, giving it the nickname ‘Lost Galaxy’. With a mirror spanning nearly eight feet (2.4 meters) across and its location above Earth’s light-obscuring atmosphere, Hubble can easily observe dim galaxies like NGC 4535 and pick out features like its massive spiral arms and central bar of stars. This image features NGC 4535’s young star clusters, which dot the galaxy’s spiral arms. Glowing-pink clouds surround many of these bright-blue star groupings. These clouds, called H II (‘H-two’) regions, are a sign that the galaxy is home to especially young, hot, and massive stars that blaze with high-energy radiation. Such massive stars shake up their surroundings by heating their birth clouds with powerful stellar winds, eventually exploding as supernovae. The image incorporates data from an observing program designed to catalog roughly 50,000 H II regions in nearby star-forming galaxies like NGC …",

When we’re anticipating the next generation of one of our favorite mobile devices, we get very excited when the first specs start arriving. Right away, we’re going to be comparing those against existing models, looking at what’s getting better, what’s staying the same, and what — god forbid — is getting a downgrade.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google has quietly removed the option to call your smart displays from the Google Home app on your phone. The “Call Home” feature allowed you to call the smart display from your phone while using the same Google account. A Redditor noted the option has vanished from the app following the recent redesign. The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices. As noted by Reddit user chelitazz , Google appears to have removed the “Call Home” button from the Google Home app on Android.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR Sideloading files to Wear OS usually requires complex ADB commands, but the new Wear APK Install app offers a simpler solution. The app creates a Wi-Fi file server, allowing you to transfer APK files from a phone or PC browser and install them directly on the watch. This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user. Thankfully, there’s a new app on the block that makes it easy to install APK files on your smartwatch, while also offering file manager functionality.

The Kobo Remote offers remote controlled page turns, months-long AAA battery life, and basic audiobook controls. Early demand wiped out the first batch, but a restock is scheduled for December 15. Kobo has officially started shipping its new Kobo Remote, a compact Bluetooth accessory that lets users flip e-reader pages without touching the device itself. The tiny, tactile controller for next- and previous-page turns isn’t a novel idea (third-party remotes have been floating around for years), but this is the first branded option built specifically for Kobo’s ecosystem, and it should offer the most seamless compatibility.

The leaked image comes from Android Headlines , which didn’t disclose its source. The phone appears in two finishes that look like a dark graphite model and a bronze-green one, and both look quite different from the smoother eco-leather style of the standard Edge 70.

According to Altman, the company has more to do to improve the quality of its core product — specifically in personalization features, speed and reliability, and allowing ChatGPT to answer more questions. In order to focus on these goals, Altman reportedly says in the memo, OpenAI is delaying planned additional features like ads in ChatGPT, AI agents for shopping and other tasks, and a digital personal assistant called Pulse.",

It will offer maximum payments to $7,500 and a new claim deadline of December 18. Eligibility is based on the severity of leaked data, with payouts ranging from $100 to $7,500. Claims can be filed online with a Class Member ID or by mailing a printed form, and payments are expected in early to mid-2026. We first reported on a major AT&amp;T data breach settlement back in August , which at the time was set to pay up to $177 million in total, with impacted customers able to claim upwards of $5,000. While this was originally supposed to happen back in November, it seems the dates and planned payouts have shifted a bit. As first reported by IBT , the final breakdown will see some users paid as much as $7,500, and the new deadline to file is December 18. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Every single phone, Android or otherwise, has an IMEI number . The IMEI number is a unique identifier that identifies a device on a mobile network, much like a personal identification number. It’s generally a good idea not to reveal or broadcast your phone’s IMEI number, just to avoid sharing it with malicious actors.

Once started, users can pinch the stems on their Buds 3 to pause or resume translation. With the Buds 4, Samsung appears to be upgrading Interpreter to let you initiate a translation session through that same pinch gesture. With December now upon us, 2026 is right around the corner, and the new year is set to bring us all manner of new product launches. One of the first we’ll be looking forward to is Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series, but we’ve got more than just phones on our radar, as we’re also anticipating Samsung’s next generation of Galaxy Buds earbuds. We’ve already taken an early look at the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro design , as well as previewed some animations showing off new Buds 4 functionality .

The ANBERNIC RG 477V, which was thoroughly leaked last month , is a new vertical handheld that brings together the best components of the company’s 2025 releases in a new form factor. As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games. The video also shows exceptionally small bezels, which isn’t the case for other vertical handhelds like the Retroid Pocket Classic .",

In fact, I originally switched to Android (Google Pixel 2 XL “panda edition,” which is still one of my favorite designs) specifically because I liked the images that Google’s camera app produced. Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",

A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings.

However, if you know where to look, some devices are actually cheaper today than they were last week, and a few are actually on some of our favorite pieces of tech.

    "body": "TL;DR Google Gemini has been working on a new “projects” option, much like ChatGPT already offers. Projects will allow you to sort files and chats around particular topics. After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.
