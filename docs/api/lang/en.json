The Kickballer fires bouncing projectiles, and when you hit a shot, it'll fire a second one for free, leading to some very high damage numbers and game-breaking visuals. However, you can't farm it right away. If you haven't been doing side content, then you've likely glossed over what you need to do without even realising it. Don't worry, though, here's how to get this game-breaking shotgun.

To even unlock this boss, you need to complete the Null and Void side mission and its follow-up quest, All Charged Up , which becomes available after beating the Rush the Gate main mission. You can start Null and Void by speaking to Rush just south of The Launchpad, near Idolator Sol's crashed ship that you'll have visited earlier in the main story.

There are so many broken builds it's untrue , and players are running around with \"infinite damage\" builds that nuke bosses in under 10 seconds… which is either great or terrible, depending on your mood. But it's probably why, in the first week of release, players have fought bosses 63 million times and defeated 55 million of them. Pretty good hit rate, and the numbers come from developer Gearbox itself, which has released a loot package for all players to celebrate… erm, all the looting. The rewards come in the form of a Shift code, Gearbox's little data-hoovering service that it uses because it can, and is called the Break Free Pack. It includes a vault hunter skin, a legendary ripper shield that scales to your level, and two ECHO-4 drone skins: the code is JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R. More interesting were the stats Gearbox released alongside the code, which include the enlightening fact that four-and-a-half million players have managed to kill themselves with grenades so far, while around two million of you shot exploding barrels while just being …",

The developer, Techland, has stuck to using its internal C-Engine software package, though it's been \"heavily modified and upgraded\" since its implementation in DL2. With Techland posting some seriously heavy system requirements and Nvidia partnering once more for RTX and DLSS additions , I was concerned that Dying Light: The Beast would be joining a growing list of recent games that don't run very well on PC. Having tested the game on a broad range of hardware, I can tell you now that it's actually all fine, even when the performance is lower than you'd like. This is especially true if you stick to 1080p or 1440p, and even though Dying Light: The Beast proudly wears an 'I love upscaling' t-shirt, you should have no problems getting a respectable frame rate on most modern gaming PCs. What's very odd, though, is that at the time of writing, there are no ray tracing options whatsoever. There was in the first review version of the game I tested, but a subs…",

A tale about someone who lives in Mr Rogers' Neighbourhood gradually coming to realise they actually live in Omelas or something. I guess that, and only that, is why I'm not Margot Robbie, who is the one Hollywood has actually tapped to make a The Sims movie for some reason, and whose production company is set to draw inspiration for the project from the Barbie film and the Lego Movie (via The Direct ). That's per one of the film's producers, Roy Lee, who told The Direct that \"Somewhere in-between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be.\" Which, great. Let me read that a few more times to see if I can figure out what it means. Nope, no luck. Okay, let me try to break it down for myself. I think we can take from this that The Sims movie will be something resembling a comedy, probably a family movie rather than a straightforward kids' film, and that its humour will be pretty universal but maybe dip into the more esoteric every now and then—you know, like the bit where Barbie chats about fascism. Also, maybe Ryan G…",

A spin-off of a popular game from a different developer, jumping on a new genre bandwagon, and seemingly built mostly with reused assets. But over the last few years I've played a lot of different Vampire Survivors imitators, and all the way through DRG:S's run in early access, I think it's been the king of the pack. It's creative, it's charming, and it genuinely bridges the gap between two wildly different games. (Image credit: Funday Games) As the swarms chase you, you're able to shape the landscape around you against them. For anyone who's been following that early access journey, the 1.0 release won't come as any startling reinvention. But it's a really confident fleshing out of the structure and features around that excellent core gameplay loop, and the result is that a roguelik…",

They booted up Doom on an old PDA, expecting it to crash at some point. That's because every time the game demo would run and then reset, the engine would store a new variable. Then it'd start up again, and again store a new variable. All in one long string until, blam-o, it'd crash due to an overflow—the data exceeding the possible bounds of the value used to store it. Though how long it'd take to crash was all theoretical, until it wasn't. Minki ran a physical test on an old PDA—you don't need much to run Doom, as proven by that time someone played it in a PDF file , or a badge for a hacking conference , or even on its own box . They then left the game running, which would cause the demo to loop over and over, to see how long it'd take to crash.

They aren't strictly necessary (I'm not sure they all count towards 100% completion), but each one is a challenge you'll want to encounter if you're a completionist. These mementos aren't available until Act 3, mainly because the quests don't spawn, or you don't have the relevant movement abilities like Silk Soar. Below, I'll explain how to get every memento.

    "body": "Little Nightmares 3 has released a short demo ahead of its launch on October 10, which will be the first hands-on look we've got at the new setting: The Nowhere. More specifically, the demo whisks you straight to the main city of the game, the Necropolis, a desolated location lost to time and sat in the middle of a desert. As is the way with any Little Nightmares game, you won't be able to navigate this landscape without the threat of a horrifying monster watching your every move. This time though, rather than some bloodthirsty mannequins or an angry teacher with an unsettlingly long neck chasing you, you're being hunted by a giant, monster baby. Yep, that's right. Who needs a gentle introduction to the game with a smaller beast when you could have a giant baby on your tail instead? Throughout the demo you'll also get to play as the new protagonists, Low and Alone, both of whom boast different weapons you'll have to figure out how to use. For Low, that means a trusty bow which can be used to hit high targets or cut through ropes, whereas Alone relies on a heavy wrench perfect for smashing barriers or manipulating machines. Of course, both of these weapons are essential for any ene…",

Atrocious mids, swampy highs, lows with the callous insouciance of a neglectful husband*. I refuse to subject my ears to that. Well, now I won't have to, and my CS2 career can finally bloom. In an update earlier today, Valve announced that the game's 'nades are almost irresponsibly hi-fi. They \"now have unique higher-fidelity sounds for draw, inspect, pin-pull, and throw.\" Our long national nightmare is over. Also, other things, but I fail to see how they compare in significance to our new crystalline 'nades. Most promising, I think, is the addition of cs_script, \"a JavaScript based scripting system for Counter-Strike maps\" that can now be used by community mapmakers. This opens the door to a whole bunch of buckwild possibilities, like community-made custom CS2 game modes (you can see an example of the scripting language in action in this X post from Gabe Follower ). That aside, you can now peer at other players' loadouts while spectating, there's a new Genesis Collectio…",

But there's one character we all severely underestimated, Amon. Looking at his skill trees, he's a bit…bland compared to the other characters , and after picking him as my main Vault Hunter, it's not far from the truth. He's generally quite clunky and just doesn't have as many broken perks as the other characters. Well, it turns out that Amon is secretly the most busted character of the bunch (and that's saying something), thanks to a potentially unintended interaction between the Berserk and There Is Only Death perks, and the Groundbreaker specialisation. The kicker is that all you need to do is punch. The goal is to stack as much bonus damage as possible from Berserk (cryo) and Groundbreaker (kinetic). You might question how we benefit from Groundbreaker, since it only triggers on non-melee damage, but the bonus cryo damage applied to melee from Berserk actually does the trick. So, every time you punch, you deal increased damage and infinitely stack even more bonus damage for the next punch. M…",

If you were hoping for some more boss nerfs or perhaps fewer obstacles on the way to bosses, then give up all hope ye who enter here. No, the latest Silksong patch—which is currently live in the public-beta branch on Steam, but will roll out officially in the coming days—is mostly about making sure the bosses themselves don't keep making dumb mistakes. Spoilers follow, but this includes: Preventing the Savage Beastfly in Far Fields from getting stuck under lava, preventing Shrine Guardian Seth from exiting the battle arena mid-combat, and making sure Lugoli stops \"flying off screen and not returning during battle\". I like a tough metroidvania and wouldn't advocate for any difficulty tweaks, but I know there are plenty of players who are frustrated with Silksong's difficulty. I guess the message is clear: if Silksong is too hard for you, keep trying . There's the chance Team Cherry will tweak dif…",

Redditors have been compiling the evidence pointing towards a VR hardware reveal from Valve on Wednesday, including multiple VR-focused YouTubers traveling to the Pacific Northwest. Competitor Meta is actually hosting its annual Connect event on September 17th and 18th, but multiple influencers have confirmed they won't be at the event (which is in Silicon Valley, not Valve's native Bellevue, Washington). Notably, Valve timed its last big VR reveal of the Index to coincide with a Facebook developer event in 2019.

That would be such a fundamental bug that it would effectively break the game. Anyway, I loaded in, did some testing, and you can probably guess where this is going. We are investigating an issue where players are unable to respawn in Solo Ops activities after dying. We are attempting to solve this issue as soon as we're able. More information will be provided when available. September 16, 2025 From my own experience, once you die the respawn button will appear after the usual countdown, but cannot be interacted with. In order to start playing again you either need to go to orbit (ie, leave the activity) or switch characters. Which is as big a problem as it sounds. The bug even seems to extend to Patrol zones, although I was occasionally able to self-revive. Quite how long it will take to fix is anyone's guess, but as you can tell by the tone of Bungie's tweet, this is a four alarm fire. You cannot have players trying to complete every solo activity in the game on a single life. I would love to tell you I'm surprised that a bug of …",

This will be most exciting if you don't own Escape from Tarkov yet and have been holding out for this very moment. If you already own it and want to play it through Steam, though, you'll need to buy it again and link your Steam account to your existing Tarkov profile, Battlestate confirmed in a blog post. It's all on the same servers so you won't have to buy the Steam version to play with Steam players, and you've always had the option of adding Tarkov as a non-Steam game to your library if all you want is the ease of access and the overlay. But all the other big features—friend list synchronization, Steam achievements, lifelong playtime tracking—will be exclusive to those who buy it through the platform.

Bloody fistfights, car chases, a diving tackle through a window—all to unravel a mystery that hits awful close to home for our grizzled protagonist. \"Sam Fisher is back and this time, the mission is personal.\" Again! It hits all the narrative and aesthetic beats I expect out of a modern spy thriller, and through that lens, I think it looks pretty neat. There's a mysterious wristwatch with coveted blueprints inside it somehow and yes, they plug it into a giant wall of green monitors, and yes, I eat that kind of thing up. But short of a few referential nods, I think the trailer is sadly a little light on Splinter Cell vibes specifically. It's a lot of action and energy for largely methodical, unhurried stealth games. My favorite moments in Splinter Cell never involved big fist fights or car chases, they involved silently panicking as guards circled me hiding in the one safe shadow in a patrol-filled room. Guns and brawls were a sign things had gone wrong, and I was most elated when the only enemies that ever saw me ended up unconscious in a crate somewhere. Okay, maybe that wouldn't make …",

Several Unique items and their powerful guaranteed stats will have new Chaos variants that are even more powerful than normal and can be equipped in new slots on your character. The idea is that a Unique that could only drop as gloves before can now show up as a pair of boots or some other piece, which opens up all kinds of combinations and new builds. \"A lot of us in the office are fans of card games, and what you do in card gaming is you typically build a deck from a bunch of different cards,\" game designer Aislyn Hall explained when asked about the inspiration for Chaos Armor on the stream. \"When I'm building my character in an ARPG, or a Diablo, I think about it in the same lens.\" Diablo 4 seasons have never felt this experimental.

One of the developers heavily affected was Zenimax Online Studios, the maker of The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), which saw the cancellation of an MMO codenamed Blackbird alongside an unspecified number of layoffs.

The GPU-Z readout makes for some interesting reading, showing 4480 shaders, 96 ROPs, and 280 TMUs—oh, and 12 GB of VRAM, a whole gigabyte more than the released card.

With the cooler removed, the chip itself looks a lot like the stock TU102 die—although as another eagle-eyed redditor has noticed, it doesn't have any markings showing the model designation. So, why did we end up with a less-powerfully-specced variant in the…",

    "body": "Switching to an open world, Borderlands 4 is massive and packed full of sidequests and activities to complete, though these generally don't give you tons of experience to level up. Completing it all once is all well and good, but you won't want to trudge through every single quest again on an alternate character. That's where the best XP farms come in, netting you heaps of experience to level up fast and with less effort, so you can focus on your favourite bits. If it's your first run through the campaign, I'd generally recommend just completing the story and exploring the open world—there's little reason to grind before then. Nevertheless, with the max level currently set to 50, and the campaign tier skip only taking you to level 30, you'll have a long way to go when levelling up alternate characters . Best Borderlands 4 XP farms The two best ways to farm XP in Borderlands 4 are to complete bounty contracts and grind drill site activities , with the latter being even better when you're playing in co-op. Both options also give you tons of money and loot (there are vending machines to sell items nearby, too), including unique legendary gear, so you'll be getting more than just XP. …",

The only N2 chips AMD has planned for next year, as far as we know, are server CPUs, not GPUs. AMD's next major AI GPU release, MI450 , is expected to be on TSMC N3 silicon. Nvidia currently uses a version of TSMC's N4 node for all its GPUs. N4 is actually a refinement of N5, which dates back to 2020. Meanwhile, the first chip made on TSMC's N3 technology, the Apple A17 Pro SoC for iPhones, debuted back in 2023. Consequently, Nvidia is now bumping up against what's known as the reticle limit with its Blackwell generation of GPUs . That's a physical limit on the size of an individual chip that can be etched onto a wafer. That physical size in turn puts a hard limit on how many transistors can be squeezed into a si…",

Though you might have assumed that you could just take the item to Forge Daughter to get it fixed up, you can actually repair it in three different locations, giving you three potential versions of the Silkshot tool that it grants you. This tool is effectively a silk gun, firing projectiles at enemies, but the nature of those projectiles changes depending on which repair method or vendor you pick. Below, I'll go through all three Silkshot options and where to find them, plus I'll explain which I think is the best. Remember, you can only choose one version of Silkshot , so decide which you'd prefer before rushing off to Forge Daughter. How to repair the Ruined Tool in Silksong You can find the Ruined Tool in Weavenest Murglin in Bilewater (Image credit: Team Cherry) You first find the Ruined Tool in Weavenest Murglin in the southeast of the Bilewater area and can then repair it in three possible locations to get the Silkshot tool—essentially a Silk gun you can use almost like a Silk Skill.

So, why not take this inherent strength and pair it with a massive 90% damage boost? That's exactly what you get with the Hot Slugger . There are well over 100 legendary gear items in Borderlands 4, and the Hot Slugger should be near the top of your list, no matter which character you're playing. It's powerful, sure, but you also spin it around like a cowboy when you reload it, and that's just cool. How to get the Hot Slugger in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can get the Hot Slugger from Callous Harbinger of Annihilating Death, the final boss of the Craven's Nook Order bunker in the Bones of Sanctuary , to the east of Terminus Ridge. You'll need to progress the campaign until you can leave the Fadefields region, as not only is this area far away, but you also need to remove the armour on the door—just look over the ledge to the left of the door, and you'll find a bio canister that you can throw at it to unlock the bunker. Enter the bunker, fight your way to the end, and beat Callou…",

There's no time pressure, and you can't go bankrupt—if you ever run out of money you can just wait until it ticks back up again, and you even get a little car you can use to drive around asteroids picking up chunks of bonus cash to speed things along. (Image credit: Toukana Interactive) Layers are gradually added—you start combining and transforming resources to get new ones, and then you're setting up networks moving resources between asteroids to get things where they're needed. But the production lines still feel simple and easy, and I was lulled into a cosy sense of security. It's what I expected from the new game from the developer of Dorfromantik.
