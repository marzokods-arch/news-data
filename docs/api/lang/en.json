The annual broadcast, returning Dec. 31 beginning at 8 p.m. ET, sees Ryan Seacrest return to lead the Times Square broadcast alongside Rita Ora, who is back for her second consecutive year helping count down the iconic New York ball drop. This year’s telecast will once again span several U.S. cities. Chance the Rapper will host from his hometown of Chicago, where he’ll guide the Central Time Zone countdown from the city’s live celebration. In Las Vegas, the show pairs NFL legend Rob Gronkowski with performer and presenter Julianne Hough, who makes her Rockin’ Eve co-hosting debut. Details for the Puerto Rico broadcast are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The multi-city structure has become a hallmark of the franchise, allowing the special to cross between stages, countdowns and performances across multiple time zones. It’s also one of ABC’s most durable draws: last year’s edition drew more than 29 million total viewers at midnight, buoyed by performances from Carrie Underwood, Sabrina Carpenter, Lenny Kra…",

The behind-the-scenes episode documents the band stepping onto the biggest stages of their career, performing to stadium-sized crowds across the country as Oasis returned to Australian venues for the first time in more than a decade. The new video follows Ball Park Music from soundcheck through to showtime, capturing the emotional and technical build-up before the house lights drop. The band — who have long cited Oasis as formative influences — are shown tuning up backstage, taking in the scale of the stadium, and reflecting on the surreal nature of opening for one of the most culturally dominant bands of the ’90s and 2000s. View this post on Instagram “It’s hard to even describe what it feels like to open for Oasis,” the band say in the episode. “We’ve all grown up with their music and to suddenly be standing there, playing before them, it’s surreal.

He explained that the symptoms began after a show in New Orleans, where he experienced a sudden, intense head pain and blurred vision. Despite performing through the discomfort, he later sought medical attention in Houston, where doctors informed him he had experienced a stroke. “I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,” he told the crowd. “I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’” He added that his first reaction was thinking he had “let everybody down,” before joking that he felt like he was “copying Jamie Foxx” — whose own stroke in 2023 made global headlines.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M.
