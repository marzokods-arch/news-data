Despite months of rumors, hopeful manifestation and just plain pleading for another round of dates in 2026, Gallagher seemed to shut the door on all that talk over the weekend when he responded to a plea from a supporter to &#8220;announce the 2026 dates mate.&#8221; And then, with with a seven-word dagger to the hearts of the Bucket Hat Nation, Gallagher responded, &#8220; we&#8217;re not doing anything in 2026 mate .&#8221; Gallagher also threw cold water on persistent whispers that the band was preparing to stage a long-awaited return to the site of one of their biggest shows ever at Knebworth in their native England. When an Oasis fan group posted that the current odds are &#8220;1/2 with William Hill to play at Knebworth next year,&#8221; the singer was clear: &#8220; ITS NOT HAPPENING .&#8221; Specifically, answering another fan who plainly asked &#8220;Knebworth next year? your so ignorant neve…",

Evidence found in the Google app shows a pop-up warning about “discarding conversation” when changing settings. The feature mirrors a recent YouTube experiment but is currently incomplete, with no input box actually available yet. YouTube has recently begun testing the ability to allow users to customize their feed , giving them control over what they are recommended to watch next. The twist, though, is that this ability is facilitated through an AI chatbot that users must interact with by entering prompts. While it’s unclear whether YouTube will graduate this experiment into a permanent feature, it seems Google may be looking to bring this AI chatbot-powered custom feed to Discover as well.

It’s not like a camera or a fingerprint reader, where you instantly know why it’s part of your device. It sits on the back of the phone with no single, obvious purpose, which might explain why many Pixel owners forget it’s even there. But, as it turns out, lots of others are using it in all sorts of ways. A recent Reddit thread asking how the thermometer “contributes to your life” spiralled into an interesting catalogue of real-world uses, from checking toddler fevers to proving a hotel room’s AC was broken. That thread sparked our curiosity, with my colleague Rita using the Pixel 10 Pro XL to track down potential insulation problems at home . She also asked you how you tend to use the thermometer in an article poll, and it turns out this supposedly gimmicky feature is surprisingly helpful. We’ve compiled a diverse range of uses here.",

The shadow and brightness sliders have returned to their original positions after being swapped earlier this year. The Pixel Camera app offers several quick-access sliders that appear when you tap anywhere in the viewfinder. These sliders let you adjust shadow levels, brightness, and white balance before taking a photo. Now, Google has made a small change to these sliders. Earlier this year, the Pixel Camera 10.1 update switched the places of the shadow and highlight sliders. Now, 9to5Google reports that the Pixel Camera 10.2 update reverts the positions of these sliders. Check out the outlet’s screenshots below.",

Update, December 10, 2025 (02:00 AM ET): The article mistakenly mentioned that Android 16 QPR2 removed some functionality in the Recents screen. These changes are in the Android Canary 2512 release. The error is regretted, and the article below has been corrected accordingly. Original article, December 9, 2025 (01:56 PM ET): What’s worse than Google removing a genuinely useful feature from Android? Well, a few things, certainly, but high on that list we’d have to put “not even realizing the tool existed until it’s already being removed.” And sadly, that may be the case for a lot of you with this neat trick in Android’s Recents screen.",

    "body": "X-ray: NASA/CXC/Univ. of Chicago/H. McCall Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the universe held together by gravity, containing up to several thousand individual galaxies and huge reservoirs of superheated, X-ray-emitting gas. The mass of this hot gas is typically about five times higher than the total mass of all the galaxies in galaxy clusters. In addition to these visible components, 80% of the mass of galaxy clusters is supplied by dark matter. These cosmic giants are bellwethers not only for the galaxies, stars and black holes within them, but also for the evolution and growth of the universe itself. It is no surprise then that NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed many galaxy clusters over the lifetime of the mission. Chandra’s X-ray vision allows it to see the enormous stockpiles of hot cluster gas, with temperatures as high as 100 million degrees, with exquisite clarity. This blazing gas tells stories about past and present activity within galaxy clusters. X-ray: NASA/CXC/Univ. of Chicago/H. McCall; Image processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/N.

The feature likely works by changing which internal key codes and axis values are transmitted to games. Last month, I shared evidence that Google is working on new gaming features for Android 17 . These include support for remapping buttons on gaming controllers and potentially a virtual gamepad. At the time, I wasn’t able to show off any of these features as the menus were incomplete.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.

AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web.

Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected.

Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Galaxy S26 Ultra has been certified by the FCC, confirming its chipset. The certification validates that both US and non-US models of the Galaxy S26 Ultra will feature a Snapdragon chipset. More specifically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 runs the Ultra model across all regions. The Galaxy S26 is set to launch sometime in early 2026. The exact launch date remains unclear, with leakers divided on whether Samsung’s last-minute changes (or rather, the reversal of those changes) to the lineup could lead to a delay. Similarly, there have been speculations about the chip of choice, with leaks suggesting Samsung might equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the other two models, with an Exynos chip instead of a Snapdragon in some regions. While the launch date remains uncertain, a recent certification might put speculation about the chipset to rest. The Galaxy S26 Ultra recently visited the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), which certified it ahead of the launch. The certification document (via The Tech Outlook ) includes different variants carrying SM-S948B, SM-S948B/DS, SM-S948U, and SM-S948U1, where U refers to the US variant, while B refers to the international variant…",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL.

    "body": "TL;DR PocketBook is selling large wall-mounted E Ink posters. The displays use color E Ink for a matte, print-like look with extremely low power usage. Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

According to users’ reports, the display on their Pixel 10 randomly freezes after the phone has been resting for a while. This isn’t the first display bug that the Pixel 10 users have been facing. The December Pixel Drop, which arrived exactly a week ago , was primarily aimed at eradicating a punch list of issues troubling users of the Pixel 6 and above. But in fixing those bugs, Google may have triggered a handful of new ones. After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

The “Magnet Wireless Battery Pack” was found on a certification page in the Wireless Power Consortium’s database. The product may further hint at Qi2 support on the Galaxy S26. It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

Of the 14 categories, Sunshiner is by far the most common type, while Philosopher and Trailblazer are the rarest at 0.1%. The spread reflects how many people use YouTube for lighter content, with only a tiny slice focusing on niche or deep-dive viewing. YouTube’s first full Recap seems to be going down well. In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with. There are 14 in total, and each one comes with a matching animated character designed by 3D artist Eva Cremers. You can see some examples of the characters below.",

The film also pulls in global moments like major cricket matches and a reference to the first American pope. Google already shared the top trending searches of 2025 last week , but now it has released the video version. The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 beta introduces a dynamic lock screen clock that more intelligently adapts to your wallpaper. While One UI 8.0 focused on people and pets, this update pushes the tech to recognize and adapt to almost any background. The new feature automatically rearranges the clock and widgets to prevent them from covering important parts of your photo. Samsung might just reignite your love for your lock screen with a smarter clock. The company just kicked off the One UI 8.5 beta program for the Galaxy S25 series, and one of the standout features is a big update to the lock screen clock. Now, it changes from a simple timestamp to a dynamic design that adapts to any wallpaper on the lock screen. The official changelog says the new “automatic lock screen layout” makes sure wallpapers with people or pets always fit just right. You don’t have to adjust anything yourself as the layout changes on its own. This means your clock and widgets move around so they don’t block important parts of your photo.",
