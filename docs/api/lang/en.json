Thanks to YouTube user isfooPoE , we now know its possible to kill some of the toughest bosses in the game without wearing a single piece of gear. Loot is king in PoE 2, as it is in any other action RPG, but it's also apparently optional if you're playing a monk with the power to shock bosses in one swift strike. IsfooPoE's build requires nothing but a set of unarmed skills that do a surprising amount of damage without any items to supplement them. Their fight against Arbiter of Ash is mighty impressive to watch, mostly because it's the clearest example of the soulslike bones in PoE 2. IsfooPoE dodge-rolls out of the bosses swings like they're in a FromSoftware game. The boss has the power to set the entire room on fire and it still can't land many hits on a dude wearing nothing but a t-shirt and pants. The high damage largely comes from a skill that triggers lightning strikes when you dash. Those lightning strikes then explode the ice walls isfooPoE puts around the boss.

And that's just the first episode, which launched into early access last year . Fans have been eagerly awaiting the second episode since then, but a development update on Steam confirmed yesterday that it won't hit its old release window of \"before the end of 2025.\" That said, it did share some exciting details, as well as a brief teaser. The teaser shows off a thing of beauty as hilarious as it is genuinely cool: a first-person car chase where the player smokes a cigar, blasts foes with a tommy gun through each window, and maneuvers with one foot on the steering wheel and another on the gas. If nothing else, it seems like the second episode will lean in even harder to the over-the-top comic book action. The rest of the update shows off some new areas, story comics, and teases Delia, a \"fully controllable NPC companion\" that responds to commands like \"move there,\" \"stay here,\" and \"shoot that fuckin' guy!\" It looks…",

And according to its new owner, it has some big goals for next year and beyond when it comes to expanding its library of classic games. Announced today , GOG will now be in the hands of Michal Kicinski. Kicinski isn't some random suit, however, he was a co-founder of GOG when it started in 2008 under CD Projekt Red—which he also co-founded. Everything about GOG will stay the same, including the games available on the platform and everyone's library of games. Kicinski preached GOG's goal of being a place for \"freedom, independence, and genuine control,\" over the games you own in the announcement post. \"This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision,\" the post reads. \"We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.\" It's also pointed out in the post that GOG has plans to \"undertake even more …",

I came away from the presentation with a big ole' meh. That changed the first time I reared up as a bear and slapped a zombie with my big, meaty paw. Say what you want about the pacing change between PoE2 and its predecessor, I really do find the combat to be more fun. Early bosses especially have that tough soulslike feel, and having to do more than just activate Righteous Fire and meander through loot explosions actually makes me enjoy the game more. That's in part down to how the skills are designed to make you use them in concert and the monsters themselves, but perhaps the biggest factor is the new character rigs that have let GGG make some really satisfying skills. When the druid rears up on its hind legs in bear form to smack things with Maul, you feel huge . The smacks are meaty and crunchy, and when you slam back down to do the second part of the…",

Last year, I made my 2025 hardware wishlist , and I absolutely nailed it when it came to Valve's products. Three in a row, literally. Steam Machines ? Yep, here they come. Steam Controller ? You bet. And a new Steam VR headset —do you even need to ask? (Image credit: Future) And listen, I can already hear the 'shotgun approach' and 'broken clock' sniggers at the back, but I shan't hear it. I am now a tech prophet, and that's that. I know it's true because I say so, and the fact that I say so can be trusted because I'm a tech prophet. Don't think about that too much.

Looking back, 2025 was a year where cozy games really broke the mold and appealed to a wider audience. Notably though, I found that I didn't just spend hundreds of hours in a dozen farming simulators. This might be a conscious effort on my part, because other than becoming infatuated with Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, I actually didn't sink much time at all into finding my next farming obsession. So if you want to do the same, here are my favorite cozy games from 2025. Top six cozy games of 2025 Once Upon a Katamari POCO The Guardian of Nature Vending Dokan!: Kozy Kiosk Out and About Hello Kitty Island Adventure Some other games I spent more time than I like to admit playing, but didn't quite make the top six: Ritual of Raven, Discounty, Instants, Is this seat taken?, and Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time .

I've always liked the idea of a charging dock conceptually, but I've never quite committed to getting a bit of gaming gear with one for a specific reason: I'm a bit lazy. I was worried I'd pay a premium for a bit of hardware, and then forget to charge it, so end up leaving it plugged in anyway, thus removing the whole point of getting it in the first place. Well, I and all my hubris didn't account for two ways that 8BitDo's Retro R8 would counter those points. First is that its retail price is $50 (with it going as low as $35 already). The second is that it looks so good, I can't help but put it on its well-earned throne. See, the Retro R8 I reviewed earlier this year comes in an NES-style theming, with a smattering of whites, greys, reds, and blacks. It looks incredible next to my 8BitDo Retro keyboard . The stand itself plugs into the PC via a USB Type-C cable, and you can pop a dongle from the bottom of the mouse into the stand. This means, with just a single cable, it can both charge the mouse and work as a wireless receiver. This i…",

It utterly swept the Game Awards, becoming the highest winner in the show's 11-year history and being the first studio debut to nab the coveted Game of the Year award. We love to look back on years by the games that defined them: 2023 was very much The Year of Baldur's Gate, and Elden Ring was the videogame mascot of 2022. But honestly? It doesn't feel quite right doing that this year. 2025 has been home to a dizzying array of incredibly cool, and interesting concepts nailed by development studios of all sizes. And I kind of love that, at least for me, I can't pinpoint a single game that has represented my entire year. (Image credit: Sandfall Interactive) Clair Obscur is not excluded from this praise—its homage to JRPGs of the late '90s with Sandfall's French twist is well-deserving of its success—but I don't remember the last time I was able to dive into so many new games that were, well, different.

However, 2025 has seen the rise of several reasonably-priced contenders that can swim remarkably close to the pricier players for minimal expense, and that's the sort of development I can really get behind. Each of the three microphones below is very well-priced for what it delivers, and also happens to be one of the best mics we've tested all year. All that's left now is to give one of our contenders the best microphone of 2025 award, so we'd better round up our nominations into one big capsule-shaped basket, hadn't we? If you're looking for the cheapest of the cheap, look no further than the Amazon Basics USB Condenser Microphone .

But at the same time, it feels like that devotion to nostalgia holds it back, with a short campaign and few incentives to replay.

But with that said, the vast majority of the low-poly art I've seen has been digital. There's nothing wrong with that, and I've loved scrolling through endless works from a huge variety of talented creators. However, the moment I laid eyes on the work of Lasher , a UK-based oil pastel artist, I knew I was in for a treat. The first piece I found from Lasher was a low-poly Chao which popped up on my TikTok feed, which I immediately fell in love with. The second I played Sonic Adventure DX on my family PC back in 2004, I became slightly obsessed with these little creatures and each time I see them in any form, be it digital or physical art, clothing, or even something as simple as plushies and figures, I form an instant connection with it.

In the old days I had no choice but to resort to amateurishly recording sound tests onto tape so I could carry some sweet chiptune bangers with me at all times. In more recent years I've gone spelunking in places like iTunes, but inconsistent regional availability, seemingly random tags that omit or misspell an artist's name or list soundtracks under a generic publisher label can make game music frustratingly hard to find. Thankfully, things are getting better—and especially on Steam. I can buy and listen to standalone soundtracks in a click or two. Capcom has enthusiastically embraced this new distribution method, offering over 100 albums on its store page , from headliners like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6 to games' that aren't available on Steam.

After all, the basic archetype for a good one is pretty much sorted at this point—a comfy headband, two earcups, a microphone, and a great set of drivers. I thought I couldn't really be surprised by a new model, but the Fractal Design Scape changed all that for me in 2025. It's got the same recipe, sure. But in terms of the experience it delivers, it feels like Fractal Design has taken all the things I love about a really good set of gaming cans and elevated them to new heights. I'm convinced it's the way all wireless gaming headsets should be from this point onwards, and that makes it the best thing I've personally tested all year. The Scape is a lesson in refinement. For a start, it's got a grown-up chassis design. No garish colour schemes here, just a flat black, matte finish with some subtle, recessed RGB lighting.

The now-ubiquitous portmanteau we use to describe the genre is, in itself, a reference to it being fertile ground for cross-pollinating ideas. Metroid's exploration dovetailed nicely with Castlevania's gothic stylings and Symphony Of The Night's surprisingly in-depth RPG elements, which Hollow Knight dials down the in favour of death mechanics and boss runbacks from Dark Souls. In recent years, we've seen plenty more experiments, with last year's Animal Well winning no shortage of praise by trading combat for ARG-adjacent layers of puzzling and cipher-cracking.

So if I must sin, I may as well see just how many forbidden phrases from the style guide I can use at once. 2025's brand new Ninja Gaiden 4, despite being a visceral action romp with more bloody decapitations than you can shake a stick at, is ultimately a bit of a mixed bag . At its core is a pulse-pounding combat system that echoes the greats of yesteryear, but it's rough around the edges.

That glimpse, created over two weeks by an ILM artist, was Star Wars: Field Guide : a two-minute fizzle reel of AI-generated blue lions, tentacled walruses, turtles with alligator heads, and zebra-stripe chimpanzees, all lazily spliced together from the shuffled bits of normal-ass animals. These \"aliens\" were less Star Wars than they were Barnum & Bailey. It felt like a singular embarrassment: Instead of showing its potential, generative AI just demonstrated how out of touch a major media force had become. And then it kept happening.

Remarkably, it's not even close. Its previous peak is from when it released into early access in 2018, at just over 33,000 players, and this holiday season has brought it screaming past 57,000 a few hours before I wrote this article (it's settled down to about 35,000 now—still a notch above the old record). The game has been good the whole time, but there are a few probable causes for this sudden surge in spire slaying. As SteamDB notes , the 2025 winter sale brought Slay the Spire to a historic low of $2.49; while the site only records sale history two years back, I don't recall it ever being quite this cheap. As everyone rushes to burn their Steam wallets on the best deals, such an acclaimed game for the price of a pack of gum is a no-brainer.

Instead of taming wild animals, you transform into monsters you've \"recorded\" to cassette tapes. There's also the fusion system, where any two monster forms can be mixed and matched to get new ones complete with original pixel art and a mashed-up name.

The time of extreme skill ceilings and the pursuit of metallic ranks defining every new multiplayer FPS is behind us. The escalation of gaudy, overpriced cosmetics created a distaste so palpable that Call of Duty had to desperately change its game plan. The two biggest shooters this year cost money, and there were no major free-to-play releases. The theme of this new era, as I see it developing so far, is remembering that shooters can be both casual and thrilling. High fun, low emotional investment. An old guard of life-consuming live-service games remains a vibrant and popular part of this genre, but they're once again sharing the space with—and even adopting the attributes of—a more casual breed.

This year didn't leave me with a lack of things to talk about, either. If anything, it was almost too busy for even the most enthusiastic of survival crafting sickos. I spent months bouncing between my sandstorm-battered home in Dune: Awakening, then bug-infested dwellings in Grounded 2, and cobbled-together cubicles of Abiotic Factor. It's just, well, I really love the thrill of collecting giant piles of junk. Then there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of taking all that junk and turning it into things. And if you give me a monotonous little chore to do on the side? That's just icing on the cake.

But not every tip you hear from other players is true. Below, I've picked a handful of Arc Raiders myths, and you'll have to figure out which ones are true and which are false.

Every year, vendors fill the market with a veritable mass of new motherboards, all vying for your attention and wallet. There are so many that it would be almost impossible for anyone to review and test them all (unless they gave up eating and sleeping for 12 months), but we managed to get through nearly 20 of them. Some of them were actually launched last year, but they're still relevant in 2025, because of the way that motherboards follow CPU release cycles. AMD and Intel released their latest generation of processors in 2024 ( Ryzen 9000 , Core Ultra 200S ), and the first series of motherboards that came with them were all sporting the high-end chipsets (i.e. X870/870E and Z890). The mainstream chipsets (AMD's B850 and Intel's B860) didn't really appear in great numbers until the start of this year. Common features that we all loved to see were: Wi-Fi 7, lots of fast M.2 slots for SSDs, user-friendly BIOS/UEFI interfaces, and quick-release mechanisms on the main PCIe slot for graphics cards and M.2 heatsinks. We also saw big improvements in the rear IO p…",

It's been a relatively quiet year for new gaming CPUs, as AMD and Intel launched the bulk of their latest processors back in 2024. Ryzen 9000-series chips first appeared in the summer, with the Core Ultra 200S range making an appearance a few months later in October. Since then, retailers' listings have mostly been filled with non-overclockable or low-power versions, but AMD did drop a few niceties for us in 2025. Admittedly, most of them weren't much of a surprise, as the Ryzen 9 9950X3D was expected right from the launch of Zen 5. And the same is somewhat true of the Ryzen AI Max and Max+ processors, better known as Strix Halo. AMD announced them at CES , and we didn't have to wait too long before we saw mighty APUs in use in the Framework Desktop and even in some handhelds . The real surprise was the Ryzen 5 7500X3D . Basically just a cut-down Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it pretty much popped out of nowhere in November, and given that AMD had already launched the Ryzen 5 7600X3D in August, few folks expected another version of it (we're still waiting for a Zen 4 ve…",

Even though there has been a strong trend of co-op games in the past few years, Aggro Crab and Landfall weren't expecting Peak to explode in popularity. \"When we flew to Sweden to release the game with the Landfall team, we were ready to hit the launch button and go into vacation mode,\" Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman told GamesRadar . \"That quickly became a pipe dream.\" Everyone immediately fell in love with the game about elastic little guys waddling up mountains together and the developers quickly pivoted to supporting it with bug fixes, new items, and new maps. And now, six months later, the game is still thriving. Earlier this month, Peak had an in-game concert by rapper bbno$ like it was Fortnite. It's all mighty impressive for a game that has still maintained its charming game jam-like quality—something Kaman said was important to maintain as the studios updated it.

Whether you were the type of kid who asked your parents for a pony for Christmas each year, the type to head down to your local riding school each weekend to muck out, or you just had stacks of books with pretty horse pictures in, let's all take a moment to be honest and say there's a horse girl in each of us. 2025 has tried, and in most cases succeeded, to coax this inner demon out in every which way it possibly can. And, even as someone who has literally never sat atop a horse, I have no shame in admitting that I was the first to fall. However, if you haven't noticed your gaming library or day-to-day life becoming infected with these powerful beasts, it's probably because you haven't realised just how significant horses have been. Because I'm not talking about the games that are basically ranch simulators for the most part. Although they have had their time in the spotlight, with the full launch of The Ranch of Rivershine, Barbie Horse Trails, and Sound of Horses, it's more so a plethora of updates and expansions that have put a particular emphasis on horses, which has led me to believe that 2025 has been the y…",

Despite a lacklustre GPU generation and the RAMpocalypse , this year's PC gaming hardware has made me very happy. That's because 2025 has seen some meaningful, non-gimmicky leaps forward in competitive FPS gaming hardware. And no, I'm not talking about unreasonably high refresh rates on monitors—although the ones from Asus I saw at Gamescom did impress me, whether OLED or TN —I'm talking about peripherals. On the mouse front, we've had a big leap in how light a sturdy wireless gaming mouse can go with the 36 g Corsair Sabre V2 Pro . But then there's what a mouse sits atop: the humble mouse pad. I can't say I thought my years of testing and writing about PC gaming hardware would lead to writing so much about a mouse pad, but here we are: My favourite piece of 'hardware' from this year was a mouse pad. The pad in question, the SteelSeries QcK Performance , isn't just your run-of-the-mill mat, though. Hear me out. Over the last couple of decades of PC gaming, I've tried variations on what have ultimately been the same kinds of mouse pad. Rubber base, cloth top…",

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Nothing says \"dollhouse simulation game that doubles as a satire on capitalism\" quite like 97 paid expansion, game, and stuff packs. The Sims has been churning out DLC before people even knew what to call it, and 25 years later we're practically drowning in all of the extra add-ons and doodads you can hand over your precious money for. But just how many of them can you actually name? Can you still recall all seven original Sims expansion packs from memory, or have you somehow catalogued all 52 of the expansion, game, and stuff packs that are in The Sims 4 as of this quiz going live? Yep, you read that right—The Sims 4 alone accounts for over half of the paid DLC available across the entire series. That's even excluding the fact that I've deigned not to include kits in this list—there are simply too damn many of them (48 at the time of writing, almost all of the rest of The Sims 4's DLC combined) and are churned out at such a rate that I imagine there'll be anothe…",

    "body": "2025 was a year of highs and lows for me. Not for personal or professional reasons, but rather because I got weirdly obsessed with the height of videogame characters. It started with the surprising revelation that every FromSoftware protagonist outside of Elden Ring Nightreign is exactly 5'7\", a fact I learned from a YouTube investigation by FromSoft savant Zullie the Witch. I'd always assumed FromSoftware protagonists were taller than this. I'm not sure why, but it's probably due to how Anglo-American entertainment media has programmed my brain to perceive heroic archetypes as tall, dark and handsome. So finding out that all FromSoft's dodge-rolling warriors are the same height as me was surprising, leading me to think more deeply about how we represent height in games. Some of this manifested in bizarre tangents, like when I bugged Arkane Studios level designer and The Black Parade director Romain Barrilliot to help me figure out the height of Garrett from Thief. Interestingly, it turns out that Garrett's height varies across the games. He's exactly six feet tall in Thief: The Dark Project , slightly taller in Thief 2: The Metal Age (though this extra couple of inches may be pur…",
