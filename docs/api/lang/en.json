A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",

We’re breaking it down further, looking at the biggest live acts, genre by genre . Today, we continue with R&amp;B. One could spin R&amp;B’s overall performance on the Boxscore charts in one of two ways. On one hand, there are just five R&amp;B acts on the overall top 100, which is fewer than any year since 2018, and half of 2023’s total. On the other, R&amp;B artists made up 12.3% of the top 100 acts’ total revenue &#8211; the genre&#8217;s second-highest share ever, totaling nearly $1.5 billion. With so few R&amp;B acts in the top 100, the genre’s upper tier does heavy lifting. Two grossed more than $300 million, with a third over $200 million and a fourth over $100 million. Last year, only one R&amp;B artist cracked nine figures. This top-heavy pile-up is even more impressive considering the genre’s biggest touring act ever out grossed all of them while detouring to country music.

    "body": "TL;DR A new rumor says that a future Samsung phone could feature a camera with a variable aperture. This development would evidently be aimed at competing with Apple, whose 2026 iPhones may feature similar hardware. The Samsung Galaxy S9, released in 2018, featured a variable aperture over its primary camera sensor. It’s been rumored for months that next year’s iPhone Pro models could incorporate a camera with a variable aperture, a feature Samsung’s Galaxy S9 phones offered way back in 2018. Now, a new rumor says that, to keep up with Apple, the dominant Android manufacturer might revisit the idea in the future. According to a post by Digital Chat Station on Weibo (spotted by Wccftech ), Samsung is currently testing variable aperture designs based on the assumption that next year’s iPhones will feature similar tech.",

Four of his first five films as a director had soundtracks that made the Billboard 200 album chart. One went double-platinum and won a Grammy; another went gold and sent its title song back into the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Reiner received a Grammy nomination for the All in the Family soundtrack (best comedy recording, 1972), an Oscar nomination for best picture ( A Few Good Men , 1992) and seven Primetime Emmy nods – five for All in the Family (outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series) and two for the HBO Max show Albert Brooks: Defending My Life – outstanding documentary or nonfiction special and outstanding directing for a documentary/nonfiction program.

Getting sick on Earth is nothing to sneeze at, but for astronauts on deep space exploration missions, the risk for contracting diseases may be elevated due to altered immunity. The Human Health and Performance Directorate&#8217;s Immunology/Virology Laboratory is ideally suited to study the effects of spaceflight on the immune system. When immune cells do not function properly, the immune system cannot respond properly to threats. This may increase susceptibility to infectious disease. Altered immunity can also lead to latent virus shedding, which is the “reawakening” of certain viruses we contract in our youth by which stay with us through adulthood. Reactivation of these viruses has been observed in some crewmembers. Conversely, when immune activity heightens, the immune system reacts excessively, resulting in things like allergy or persistent rashes, which also have been reported by some crewmembers during flight. Working in collaboration with the Human Research Program, the Immunology/Virology Laboratory is active…",

Most apps and services aim for feature parity between the two platforms, and when they don’t, it’s often iPhones that win, not Android phones — sadly. But that’s not the case with one particular Spotify feature that only exists on Android because it could technically only exist on Android: App shortcuts. I’m specifically talking about the ability to make unlimited home screen app shortcuts for any Spotify artist or album. Let me walk you through it.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We spotted that Google is testing a less intrusive placement for the Remix button in Google Messages after user complaints. The Remix option has been relocated from image overlays to menus or UI edges in several views. There’s still no way to disable Remix, and it remains unclear when or if these changes will be rolled out. Google Messages’ new Remix feature hasn’t exactly had the warmest reception. We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Now, an update to the Apple TV app for Android adds Google Cast support for casting to smart TVs and displays.

Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays.

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average.

As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co.

New code found in the Spotify app suggests a specific “Reduce animations” toggle is coming to the app. This feature could help users with motion sensitivity or those who simply find the autoplaying visuals too distracting. Spotify gives users plenty of reasons to switch over to its service . Features like Spotify Wrapped set up the whole year-in-recap trend, while the service has also been leaning into AI to help curate your next playlist . These additions have come at a steady pace, but the app also needs a cleanup — or at least, an option to disable some of the distractions.

While iOS 26.2 doesn’t fix it, some folks have also figured out a fix Apple has long attempted to keep Android and related services out of reach for its users . That friction inadvertently impacts users switching from an Android device to an iPhone or using both OSes at the same time. Now, it appears iOS bugs may also lean into those biases. Several iPhone users noticed an unexplained iOS 26 bug that changes the colors of pictures taken on Android devices and shared with them. Numerous reports on Reddit say that their pictures, when viewed in the iOS Photos app, turn red when they zoom in on the image. The same does not occur while viewing the images on a device running iOS 18.",

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops.

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price. Suddenly, a flat screen feels less like a staple and more like a convenience I’ve been overvaluing out of habit.

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

Doomscrolling short-form videos on social media and a writer’s job that requires me to stare at walls of text (and write them too) have made me incapable of finishing a book. I’ve long considered it a shame, as once upon a time, I could read and finish an entire Harry Potter book in a day. But now, I can barely cross a few pages before losing my concentration and floating away. If you find yourself in a similar situation of being unable to read through a book anymore, here’s a new app that could help you bring back your reading habit, one sentence at a time.

High-end 16GB RAM models may nearly disappear, and 12GB and 8GB models could see massive reductions in availability as makers revert to 8GB and 4GB RAM, respectively. Phone makers are caught between pricing pressures and reduced availability of consumer-grade DRAM as RAM manufacturers prioritize HBM supply for enterprise customers. 2026 isn’t shaping up to be a good year to buy a new phone, or any new tech in general. We’ve heard reports that phones are about to become more expensive due to RAM inflation . Now, new reports suggest that phone specs could actually start going backwards because of RAM inflation.

We already know that foldable phone repair costs can be pricey, but you might want to brace yourself if you damage the TriFold’s screen. Tipster yeux1122 reports on their blog that it costs 1.657 million or 1.834 million won (~$1,123 or ~$1,243) to fix the Galaxy Z TriFold’s folding display.
