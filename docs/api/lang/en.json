Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.)

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 37-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them.

She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career.
