    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority I love my Pixel , but it’s missing a few important features I mentioned in my post that was published yesterday . That got me thinking that I should perhaps switch back to a OnePlus phone, after years of using Pixels. I don’t need the latest and greatest, and I don’t want to spend more than around $600 on a phone, so the OnePlus 15 is out of the question. But there is an upcoming phone from OnePlus that has a lot of the features I want and fits within my budget, and I’d be willing to trade my Pixel 9a for it — but there are three things holding me back.",

That’s why we have gadgets like massage guns, foam rollers, and specialized shoes with plates and innovative midsole foams. Sometimes, though, that’s still not enough. When that happens, runners turn to even more extreme measures to get their miles in. We buy shoes with illegal stack heights, pick up fancy compression boots to squeeze the pain out of our legs, and step into exoskeletons to make each step easier.

On this topic, my colleague Rita El Koury recently wrote about the profound impact that Apple’s design choices have on Android brands . While most Android purists might disagree, I’m glad that one of my favorite Android brands , OnePlus, is implementing some iOS-inspired features. One of my favorites lets you control accessories, especially wireless earbuds, much more easily. The addition comes with OnePlus’ new OxygenOS 16 interface, introduced to the OnePlus 13 late last month and now rapidly spreading to several older or less premium devices (while the OnePlus 15 arrived with it out of the box).",

    "body": "Recently, I’ve been thinking about what my dream phone would include — specifically, which specs, features, and overall design. Let’s start with a massive battery, say 7,500mAh with fast charging to boot. Then, it needs great cameras, such as a 200MP telephoto lens and 4K 120fps LOG recording, to meet my professional videography needs. Add tiny bezels, a bright display, and a vapor chamber for cooling. Let’s include 512GB of storage as well, just to be safe. Interestingly, if you put all that together, you get the OPPO Find X9 Pro. I’ve tested many phones this year, from the Galaxy S25 Ultra to the Pixel 10 Pro XL , but none have excited me as much as the Find X9 Pro. Let me explain why.",

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

Over the past week, many Analogue 3D customers finally got their consoles after more than a year of waiting. Now, another N64 FPGA console is close to release, and unlike the minimalist black and white console from Analogue, it’s a much more faithful, and colorful, console. The ModRetro M64 was briefly revealed earlier this week, but today we got a full look at three transparent colorways: green, purple, and white. Each has four controller ports in the front, a power button, a menu dial, and an eject button at the back. On the back of the console, there’s a USB-C power port, HDMI out, two USB-C ports, and an SD card slot.",

And no, this time we’re not talking about ill-conceived tariffs torpedoing the economy. Earlier this year, Samsung shared the unthinkable: It was about to start serving advertisements on refrigerator screens in our kitchens.

Last year, Google introduced the Restore Credentials API within Android’s Credential Manager, aiming to solve one of the most significant friction points of switching phones: Getting logged out of all your apps. A year later, Google has shared an update on how this has progressed, and this small change has helped Uber reduce manual logins by an estimated 4 million logins per year!

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

Samsung’s next update could also give app icons a subtle 3D redesign with drop shadows, appearing in both light and dark modes.

Samsung’s next update may finally address one of the most persistent and overlooked issues with dark mode in recent years: app icons that never adapt to the nighttime theme.
