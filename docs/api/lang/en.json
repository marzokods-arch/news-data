    "body": "Credit: Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority The Galaxy S26 series isn’t even official yet, but the mood around Samsung’s next flagship launch already feels unusually flat. New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",

    "body": "I’ve spent the last decade chasing a very specific kind of device. My love for all things E-Ink is well documented, and for years I’ve wanted a device that can combine the benefits of E-Ink with the versatility of a full-fledged tablet . I want a single device that can swap out my paperback, take notes as responsively as an old-school notepad, and handle a modern digital workflow without breaking a sweat. It sounds simple enough. We’ve had E-Ink readers for years, and we have had tablets for even longer. The logical endpoint, the holy grail, would be a fast and fluid color E-Ink reader. Imagine a screen that can render comic books in full color, handle highlighting for PDFs, and manage color-coded calendars, all while giving me the benefits of all-out sunlight readability and battery life. Sounds perfect to me. I’ve spent years chasing a device that can merge the magic of E-Ink with the flexibility of a real tablet. On paper, the Boox Note Air 5C is exactly that device. It’s certainly not the first color E-Ink tablet on the market, but it does strike an effective balance of hardware, software, and support to seemingly bridge the gap between a Kindle and an iPad.

In a new beta, the app is working on adding support for satellite and terrain imagery, as well. With all three views, you’ll also be able to toggle on traffic density data. Google Maps is one of the most useful tools the company has ever created, and it’s all too easy to take what it offers for granted. Sure, we had stuff like MapQuest before it, but from basically the moment Google Maps arrived it started showing everyone else how mapping should be done. In the years since, its 3D imagery and first-person Street View photography have made distant corners of the world accessible in ways they never were before. And now, it looks like Google’s finally getting around to letting the Find Hub tap in to more of these fantastic Maps assets.

Earlier on Monday night, Ross featured among the Top 6 finalists, each of whom was tasked with performing two songs — one contemporary and one classic. Ross went with ABBA ’s classic “The Winner Takes It All,” and opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour.” Each coach entered the finale with one artist selected from the Playoffs: Ralph Edwards for Snoop Dogg, Aubrey Nicole for Reba McEntire, Ross for Niall Horan, and Jazz McKenzie for Michael Bublé. Two additional finalists — Max Chambers from Team Bublé and DEK of Hearts from Team Niall — earned their spots through viewer votes. When America’s final votes were counted, Horan once again got the rub of the green. The former One Direction star can now boast three consecutive wins as a coach, becoming the first coach in the history of the show to win their first three seasons. The Irishman is just the second coach (after Blake Shelton) to win three in a row. Ross…",

Who did Carpenter write “Manchild” about? Drink. What was the most unhinged thing she’s done to impress a crush? “I don’t think I’ve tried to impress anyone,” Carpenter responded. “That’s such a boring answer.” Yes it is.

Not long ago, a special joint initiative by Billboard China and Tencent Music culminated in the 2025 Billboard Global No.1s China honors, where Zi Yu emerged as the country’s representative winner. After two rounds of fan voting and recommendations, the rising Mandopop artist clinched the No. 1 spot with his song “Quagmire,” earning him the title of China’s Global No. 1s honoree. Released in August this year, “Quagmire” became Zi Yu’s first single to reach No. 1 on the Tencent Music charts. And beginning this summer, his popularity began to soar rapidly. Several subsequent singles such as “Too Deep,” “Say It Before Sunrise” and “Sunny Day After Rain” all went on to top the TME Uni Chart. He became one of the very few highly popular young artists in recent years to score five No. 1 hits in his debut chart year. Meanwhile, his music festival schedule has grown increasingly packed, and he recently announced his solo concert. Zi Yu is like a vibrant fish leaping into the vast ocean.

Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network?

This development would evidently be aimed at competing with Apple, whose 2026 iPhones may feature similar hardware. The Samsung Galaxy S9, released in 2018, featured a variable aperture over its primary camera sensor. It’s been rumored for months that next year’s iPhone Pro models could incorporate a camera with a variable aperture, a feature Samsung’s Galaxy S9 phones offered way back in 2018. Now, a new rumor says that, to keep up with Apple, the dominant Android manufacturer might revisit the idea in the future. According to a post by Digital Chat Station on Weibo (spotted by Wccftech ), Samsung is currently testing variable aperture designs based on the assumption that next year’s iPhones will feature similar tech.",

As first reported by PiunikaWeb , a Google engineer recently marked a related issue as “fixed” on Google’s public issue tracker.

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

Google hasn’t yet forgotten about your previous-gen earbuds and has just rolled out a new firmware update for the original Pixel Buds Pro. From what we can tell, this marks the first publicly acknowledged update for the earbuds in quite some time. According to a post on the Pixel Buds Pro Help Forum , firmware version 5.11 is now becoming available. Google says the update focuses on bug fixes, performance improvements, and security updates, but doesn’t share any specific details beyond that.",

A lot has changed in a year, with AI generation tools making a big leap forward. Nano Banana Pro is a lot better than Imagen 4 used in my post last year, as it has the ability to create more realistic images, ditching things like super smooth skin and that perfect bokeh effect in some cases. The tool also allows me to make minor changes to specific parts of an image, which was impossible a year ago, since Gemini just created a brand new image when I asked for a change.",

There’s no getting around the fact that you are feeding an immense amount of deeply personal information, from journal entries to sensitive work emails, into a black box owned by trillion-dollar corporations. What could go wrong? Now, there’s no going back from AI, but there are use cases for it where it can work as a productivity multiplier. And that’s why I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of researching local AI . If you’re not familiar with the concept, it’s actually fairly simple. It is entirely possible to run a large language model, the brains behind a tool like ChatGPT, right off your computer or even a phone. Of course, it won’t be as capable or all-knowing as ChatGPT, but depending on your use case, it might still be effective enough.

According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers.

The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co.

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

It will launch on December 25 at $34.99, but you can get an early bird discount, bringing the price down to $29.99. Earlier this week, ANBERNIC revealed the full specs of its upcoming Game Boy-like vertical handheld, the RG 477V . Although we don’t know what the launch price will be yet, it’s safe to assume it will be over $200. If you need a dose of Game Boy nostalgia but want that experience at a more affordable price, you may be interested in Gamesir’s upcoming mobile controller. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
