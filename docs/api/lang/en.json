TL;DR The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, is expanding its mandate against Android use for official purposes. According to reports from the Israeli media, IDF officers with ranks above Lieutenant Colonel are now banned from using Android phones. The IDF believes rival forces can install malware on Android devices to access troops’ locations or saved files. The never-ending Android vs iOS clash is taking a political turn with Israel now picking favorites. As the Gaza war wages for over two years, the Israeli administration is planning steps, it thinks, that might limit cybersecurity-related incidents. In this endeavor, Israel is planning to expand its restrictions on mobile phone use to senior officers beyond a certain rank, banning Android phones for official use.",

You can no longer buy collections, and you must download existing wallpapers before the app is removed. Users will receive automatic pro-rated refunds for active subscriptions, and the app code is promised to be open-sourced after shutdown. Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified . Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Marques has announced that Panels is shutting down. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The rising British singer-songwriter called out the platforms last week after fans discovered third-party listings priced at more than 14 times the original cost — in some cases surpassing $1,000. In an open letter, Dean described the unchecked resale market as “disgusting,” “vile” and fundamentally “exploitative,” urging companies to “do better” to protect fans. On Wednesday, Ticketmaster responded with a rare concession: a commitment to cap future resale rates for Dean’s tour and to begin refunding fans who paid above face value on its platform. “We support artists’ ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. @OliviaDeano, we will cap resale prices on our site at face value and hope other resale sites will follow,&#8221; Ticketmaster initially replied.

It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M.

That’s why we have gadgets like massage guns, foam rollers, and specialized shoes with plates and innovative midsole foams. Sometimes, though, that’s still not enough. When that happens, runners turn to even more extreme measures to get their miles in. We buy shoes with illegal stack heights, pick up fancy compression boots to squeeze the pain out of our legs, and step into exoskeletons to make each step easier.

While most Android purists might disagree, I’m glad that one of my favorite Android brands , OnePlus, is implementing some iOS-inspired features. One of my favorites lets you control accessories, especially wireless earbuds, much more easily. The addition comes with OnePlus’ new OxygenOS 16 interface, introduced to the OnePlus 13 late last month and now rapidly spreading to several older or less premium devices (while the OnePlus 15 arrived with it out of the box).",

YouTube’s Twitter account is one of the more innocuous things you’ll find on that increasingly distasteful platform, and beyond occasionally sharing news of feature additions or the latest content to arrive, it tweets some pretty harmless messages : “it’s a stay-in-and-watch-videos-with-friends kind of night,” “ when your watch history is more accurate than your horoscope ,” or “thankful for creators who inspire us every day .” But earlier this week, the account really stepped in it — in a way that the people running it probably never anticipated.

The ModRetro M64 was briefly revealed earlier this week, but today we got a full look at three transparent colorways: green, purple, and white. Each has four controller ports in the front, a power button, a menu dial, and an eject button at the back.

But as reported (via SamMobile ) by several existing users, Adaptive Clock has not been working as intended.

OnePlus is gearing up to launch the OnePlus Ace 6T in China next week, and this phone is widely expected to be launched globally as the OnePlus 15R . We already know a few specs about both phones, and the company has now revealed battery details for the Ace 6T. OnePlus confirmed on Weibo that the OnePlus Ace 6T will have an 8,300mAh battery. This would be 1,000mAh larger than the OnePlus 15’s already gigantic battery (7,300mAh). OnePlus isn’t skimping on charging speeds, either, as the phone will have 100W wired charging.

First, it was RCS coming to the iPhone (in whatever watered-down form it arrived), and now, with Google making AirDrop interoperable , the walls between the two ecosystems suddenly don’t feel that high anymore. Google has done a mammoth job here. Getting AirDrop to play nice with Quick Share on Pixel 10s, while keeping security intact, is a big deal for the “community effect” iPhone users have always enjoyed. I know I won’t feel left out when people around me AirDrop videos they took of the stage at a concert just because I’m carrying a Pixel. While this is just a start, Google could take on a bunch of other areas and make them more seamless for both Android and iPhone users, bringing down the ecosystem walls brick by brick.",

Walks, in particular, can rely on step data rather than GPS, resulting in potentially inaccurate figures. Wearables like smartwatches are utterly packed with sensors, and in using them we gather all sorts of data. But just how accurate are all of those numbers? With some, like calories burned during an exercise, it makes sense that the figure’s just an estimate, and we shouldn’t expect it to be precise. Other numbers, like how many steps you’ve taken, we’d assume were exact figures. Which of those camps would you think distance measurements fall into?

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots.

Samsung’s next update could also give app icons a subtle 3D redesign with drop shadows, appearing in both light and dark modes.

Samsung’s next update may finally address one of the most persistent and overlooked issues with dark mode in recent years: app icons that never adapt to the nighttime theme.

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images. Award: $55,000 in total prizes Open Date: November 25, 2025 Close Date: January 19, 2026 For more information, visit: https://www.topcoder.com/nasa-crater-detection",
