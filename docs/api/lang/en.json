When massive corporations like Google and Disney butt heads with each other, the reverberations can continue for a lot longer than you might expect. Back at the end of October, after the two failed to reach a new deal, Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV . That was the outcome everyone expected, but then things started going further: First we saw the Google Play Store and Google TV drop sales of Disney titles . And then Disney’s Movies Anywhere service stopped syncing with Google Play and YouTube purchases.

Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology) Using its Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured never-before-seen details of the Red Spider Nebula, a planetary nebula, in this image released on Oct. 26, 2025 . NIRCam is Webb&#8217;s primary near-infrared imager, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations. Webb’s new view of the Red Spider Nebula reveals for the first time the full extent of the nebula’s outstretched lobes, which form the ‘legs’ of the spider. These lobes, shown in blue, are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years. Outflowing gas from the center of the nebula has inflated these massive bubbles over thousands of years. Image credit: ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology)",

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.

It gains access to your Android after being installed via an APK file, and then monitors your phone’s interface, chats, and even button presses. It then recreates fake banking app UIs to steal your banking data, and places restrictions that prevent it from being uninstalled. Update, November 25, 2025 (11:27 AM ET): Google has reached out to Android Authority with a statement regarding the Sturnus malware. A spokesperson tells us: Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect , which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVyfNGZUns I’ve been dipping in and out of classic game emulation for years now, but one trend that I hadn’t really appreciated until recently was the use of “spoof” APK versions that you won’t find in the Google Play Store. In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

At first glance, the new Honor Choice Bee AI Projector Air looks like a basic compact projector, but it also supports stylus input and gesture controls. In other words, the device can turn your wall into a makeshift writing surface. It’s an odd combo that is definitely niche, yet potentially useful for your next game night. For now, the device has only launched in China, but it introduces a unique angle to the budget projector space. The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling. For specs, Honor lists 1080p resolution and 280 CVIA lumens of brightness. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI 2.0, USB, and a headphone jack. It also features a built-in 5W speaker.",

If you’ve been circling the idea of going super-ultrawide, this is the kind of price that makes the jump a lot easier to justify. The Samsung G95C monitor isn’t subtle. It’s a massive 32:9 curved DQHD panel that essentially gives you the screen real estate of two 27-inch QHD monitors stitched together without bezels getting in the way. The steep 1000R curve wraps around your peripheral vision, and paired with its 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync Premium Pro, it’s built for fast, fluid gameplay rather than just looking dramatic on a desk.",

Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s own virtual assistant Bixby may soon be powered by an AI chatbot. Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",

That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters.

This means that transferring copied content between Android devices currently requires a third-party tool. Fortunately, that could change in next year’s Android 17 update, as we’ve spotted evidence that Google is working on a ‘ Universal Clipboard ’ feature.

Fast-forward to 2025 and I’m more convinced than ever that this is the case, as OnePlus follows up the excellent OnePlus 13 with the polarizing OnePlus 15 . This also comes after the OnePlus 10 Pro was followed by the OnePlus 11. I recently wrote an opinion piece outlining my admittedly crazy theory about the two companies. I also included a poll asking readers whether they thought OPPO was trying to ruin OnePlus. Well, the results are in, and here’s how you answered it.",

    "body": "As a longtime Gmail and Google Photos user, I’ve always had my eye on Google One subscription plans. For the better part of a decade, I tried just about anything to avoid paying up for Google One storage , pushing the free 15GB of cloud storage to its limit. Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",
