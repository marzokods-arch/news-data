    "body": "Metallica closed out the Australian leg of their M72 World Tour with a tribute to two of the country’s most influential rock acts, performing covers of AC/DC and Rose Tattoo during their Nov. 15 concert at Sydney’s Accor Stadium. The gesture came during the band’s signature “doodle” segment — the stripped-back interlude led by guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo — which has become a staple of the current tour. The pair launched into an instrumental version of AC/DC’s “For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)” before shifting into Rose Tattoo’s “Nice Boys Don’t Play Rock ’n’ Roll,” drawing loud approval from the sold-out crowd. The moment carried added resonance as AC/DC were performing their own Power Up tour the same night in Melbourne, creating a rare split-city convergence of two generations of rock royalty. The Sydney show capped a five-city Australian run in which Metallica incorporated local tributes at every stop.
