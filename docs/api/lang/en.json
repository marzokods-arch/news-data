Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

In a ruling late Tuesday (Sept. 30), Judge Arun Subramanian rejected Combs&#8217; various arguments for a new trial, including his eyebrow-raising claim that the “freak-off” sex parties at the heart of the case were just porn movie shoots protected by the First Amendment. “Illegal activity can’t be laundered into constitutionally protected activity just by the desire to watch it,” the judge wrote. “Combs’s conduct goes far beyond that point.” Judge Subramanian also rejected arguments about the Mann Act, the federal prostitution law Combs violated. His lawyers argued that the star merely hired men for consensual sex with his girlfriend, which they said didn’t meet the definition of “prostitution.” But the judge didn’t buy it. “That definition would narrow prostitution almost out of existence,” he wrote. “It would exclude any situation in which a person pays a third party (like a brothel) to have sex with an employee.” The ruling will clear the way for Combs&#8217; sentencing, which is scheduled for Friday (Oct. 3).
