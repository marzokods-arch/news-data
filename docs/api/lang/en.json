A study published in October 2025 analyzed data from NASA’s Cassini mission and found evidence of previously undetected organic compounds in a plume of ice particles like the ones seen here. The ice particles were ejected from the ocean that lies under Enceladus’ frozen shell. Researchers spotted not only molecules they’ve found before but also new ones that lay a potential path to chemical or biochemical activity. Learn more about what they discovered.

The inner portion of NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (which consists of the telescope, instrument carrier, two instruments, and spacecraft) recently passed thermal vacuum testing. In this photo, the assembly is being lifted out of the Space Environment Simulator after completing 65 days of assessments. Credit: NASA/Jolearra Tshiteya “We want to make sure Roman will withstand our harshest environments,” said Rebecca Espina, a deputy test director at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “From a mechanical standpoint, our heaviest loads and stresses come from launch, so we use testing to mimic the launch environment.” The vibration an…",

Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology) Using its Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured never-before-seen details of the Red Spider Nebula, a planetary nebula, in this image released on Oct. 26, 2025 . NIRCam is Webb&#8217;s primary near-infrared imager, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations. Webb’s new view of the Red Spider Nebula reveals for the first time the full extent of the nebula’s outstretched lobes, which form the ‘legs’ of the spider. These lobes, shown in blue, are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years. Outflowing gas from the center of the nebula has inflated these massive bubbles over thousands of years. Image credit: ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology)",

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images. Award: $55,000 in total prizes Open Date: November 25, 2025 Close Date: January 19, 2026 For more information, visit: https://www.topcoder.com/nasa-crater-detection",
