On Wednesday (Dec. 31) night, the 46-year-old pop star shared a selfie on social media showing herself in a hospital gown with a bandage on her neck while resting in a hospital bed. Despite the unexpected setting, the “Get the Party Started” singer appeared in good spirits, smiling brightly as she reflected emotionally on 2025 and explained the reason for her hospital stay. P!nk joked on Instagram that she wasn’t there for facial plastic surgery, but instead had received &#8220;two new shiny discs in my neck,&#8221; adding that &#8220;rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll is a contact sport.&#8221; She also noted that while she recovered alone in the hospital, her family was still able to enjoy the holiday by snowboarding. &#8220;This year was a doozy for all of us and it ran the spectrum from absolutely devastating to mildly annoying,&#8221; P!nk wrote in a lengthy caption. &#8220;In amongst all of that, there was so much beauty.

While we&#8217;ve all got things to work and improve on for the year to come, we also have some wishes for things our marquee pop stars could commit to accomplishing in 2026, both for our sakes and for theirs. On this first 2026 episode of the&nbsp; Greatest Pop Stars podcast , host Andrew Unterberger is joined by&nbsp; Billboard &nbsp;charts senior analyst/writer (and regular Greatest Pop Stars guest) Eric Frankenberg to offer some New Year&#8217;s resolutions on behalf of said pop stars. We each choose five resolutions for specific pop stars to take on for 2026, and then we also offer one each on behalf of all pop stars collectively, and then one for us ourselves as pop fans. Among the most pressing questions addressed: Is it more important for Beyoncé to return in 2026 with visuals for her last two albums or with the last act in her LP trilogy? Would Dua Lipa be better served working with more dead-center pop collaborators on her next album? Are we overdue for an Adele legacy year? What …",

At 11pm local time, the official festivities were paused to observer a minute’s silence, as the Harbour Bridge was lit up with white light to symbolize peace, and a menorah was projected onto its pylons to show solidarity with the Jewish community. “Never Tear Us Apart” has a special place in the hearts of Australians. Released in 1988 as the fourth single from the album Kick , “Never Tear Us Apart” lent its name to a 2014 Australian biopic on the band, and the life and untimely passing of its singer Michael Hutchence. That two-part miniseries reignited interest in the new wave group, which is no longer active. Earlier in 2025, the song came in at No.1 on triple j’s inaugural Hottest 100 of Australian Songs poll.

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

Since its inception, NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) has led this effort. CERES has a long history with seven different instruments flying on five different missions since 1997. As of today, six CERES instruments remain in orbit – two are no longer operational: the Proto-Flight Model (PFM) unit flew on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and functioned for a brief period, and FM2, which was powered-off in January 2025 due to battery constraints on Terra. The active CERES instruments are found on Terra (FM1), Aqua (FM3 and 4), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) (FM5), and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) mission, now known as NOAA-20 (FM6).
