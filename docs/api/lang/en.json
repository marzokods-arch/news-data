    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Every Apple event, be it WWDC or the new iPhone launch, brings me a set of confusing thoughts. There’s a lot of mockery over what Apple has decided to copy innovate and their random announcements that no one asked for ( hello, iPhone Air ), but also a bit of jealousy-slash-awe at Apple’s pull over the entire phone industry. I see that new front-facing camera, and I know many Android brands are now scrambling to copy it in 2026; it’ll easily be the new gold standard of selfie cameras. But if there was one thing that stood out to me more than the silly thinness of the Air and its external battery pack, the misleading “fusion” lens, the 120Hz refresh rate on the base iPhone, and the new modems and chips, it’s one tiny detail: The iPhone 17 now starts at 256GB .",

It also doesn’t help that Google stumbled out of the gate with the recent Pixel 10 launch. Thanks to the latter’s unexpectedly small performance and battery life gains, I see no compelling reason to upgrade from my Pixel 8. But after mulling the decision over, I came to realize that I’d be giving up much more than I initially thought if I switched over to an iPhone. And it’s all thanks to Google’s slow but steady creep of useful feature additions to Android over the past couple of years.",

    "body": "For the past decade, Google has consistently published an Android Security Bulletin every month, even if the company wasn’t ready to roll out a security update to its own Pixel devices. These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

That’s all you need to know if you’re OK with your phone taking up a couple of hours to charge. But if you want fast charging, you should buckle up. The world of USB-C is as messy as it is simple , and although one uniform port does the job, there are dozens of different speeds, protocols, and capabilities hidden in it — some prevalent, others uncommon. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of those special cases; it requires a specific flavor of USB-C fast charging that not every wall charger will offer, and finding the right one can be frustrating.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The first Nintendo Switch emulator is up on the Google Play Store. Eden Emulator is a fork of one of the most successful and infamous Switch emulators. Your phone will need to be running on Android 11 or later. At the end of last week, Nintendo Switch emulator Eden received a major update that saw the official stable release of version 0.0.3. This update fixed a number of bugs, provided some performance boosts, integrated EmuReady, and brought support for the recently released Hollow Knight: Silksong. While this update was big news, the team behind Eden has been teasing an even bigger surprise. That surprise has now been revealed. If you head over to the Google Play Store , you’ll now find a listing for the Eden Emulator, complete with screenshots, details about the software, data safety information, and everything else you’d find in a normal app listing. That’s right, it appears Eden is now available on the Play Store for devices running on Android 11 or later. This is a significant turn of events as it marks the first time ever that a Switch emulator has been on the marketplace.",

    "body": "TL;DR Pixel 10 phones have been refusing to make and maintain a Bluetooth connection with Samsung Galaxy Watch models. Installing the August Google Play system update appears to fully resolve the glitch. Getting set up with a brand-new phone is one of the great joys of our year, and that’s especially true when we’re working with one of Google’s latest Pixel phones. Right now the Pixel 10 series offers a lot to like, but some owners are running into new-phone compatibility issues — like the one we just looked at with the Pixel 10 and Android Auto , or the problems with Google Home notifications on the Pixel 10 . Another big glitch has been interfering with Pixel 10 phones pairing with Samsung Galaxy Watch models, but we’ve finally got some good news for you there. We first heard about this problem one week ago, with online forums and social media filling up with reports of new Pixel 10 series owners who were struggling to get their Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch 7, and Galaxy Watch Ultra models to connect over Bluetooth. We even experienced this headache first-hand, trying and failing to pair a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with one of our Pixel 10 Pro XL handsets.",

After testing a redesign back in November, that new look is arriving in on the app. The redesign repositions control buttons and features, while also introducing a dual-pane design. First spotted by 9to5Google , Now Playing’s new design will force you to retrain your muscle memory. For example, you’ll no longer see the Song/Video switcher at the top of the screen. It now sits in a carousel with a group of other controls immediately below the scrubber. However, the arrow, Cast, and three-dot menu remain in the same place as before.",

Early adopters include fintech companies like Klarna and OnePay, which are adding mobile service to their financial apps. Unlike most prepaid brands, Gigs-powered services can openly advertise that they run on AT&amp;T’s network. Carriers are increasingly making it easier for independent companies to launch their own wireless brands. Last year, T-Mobile unveiled “ Your Name, Our Wireless ,” a program where virtually any business can set up its own carrier, with T-Mobile doing most of the heavy lifting. Now AT&amp;T is taking a similar step, though with a few twists. Instead of running everything directly, AT&amp;T is working with Gigs, a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) that provides the back-end tools needed for others to create and manage prepaid services on AT&amp;T’s network. Another big difference is that Gigs OS is designed for tech companies that want to integrate connectivity into existing apps and services, rather than for companies aiming to launch stand-alone prepaid brand…",

We got our first hint of more affordable flip phones when Motorola started to launch cheaper Razr entries, followed by offerings from brands like nubia and TECNO on the global market. But our prayers for a more affordable Galaxy Z Flip phone went unanswered. Now, Samsung has finally launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the more expensive Galaxy Z Flip 7 . However, after testing the Flip 7 FE for a week or so, I’m sad to say my prayers for a more affordable Z Flip that I can fully enjoy using haven’t been answered yet.",

The original poster detailed their experience buying the most expensive Pixel out there, not being happy with it, returning it, and buying the Pixel 9a instead, and ending up much more content with the cheaper phone despite their (very tech-savvy) friends’ constant taunting about the 9a’s lower specs and cheaper build quality. That thread hit a chord for me because it’s something I’ve experienced time and again when buying or reviewing phones for Android Authority , as well as when talking about phone purchases with my friends and family. Everyone is just happier with the cheaper phones; it’s anecdotal evidence, sure, but looking for the absolute best Android phone is bound to end in misery and dissatisfaction.",

Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all.

Google quickly confirmed the problem, and this week reports that a fix is available to those running Android Auto 15. Despite that news, quite a few Pixel 10 owners share that their problems with Android Auto have yet to resolve. If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

Getting the smart driving companion to work consistently can sometimes be an effort in futility. For example, users recently discovered an issue where Pixel 10 devices would cause Android Auto to freeze . Thankfully, Google has now implemented a fix with the most recent update. However, there’s a new annoying problem on the horizon that’s affecting audio playback. Multiple reports are coming in from Reddit about a bug that’s causing music to stutter and skip when connected to Android Auto wirelessly. The issue looks to be happening regardless of the user’s phone brand. It appears the problem may be connected to Google Maps and Waze.",

While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand. Unfortunately, some users appear to be buying Pixelsnap Chargers without checking the power requirements first, and are understandably having a pretty frustrating time as a result.",

Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish.

This toggle controls whether the mouse cursor can move between screens when it reaches the edge, preventing accidental screen-hopping. Found in the first QPR2 beta, this small but welcome change gives users more control over Android’s DeX-like desktop experience. One of the most exciting features in Android 16 QPR1 is its new DeX-like desktop experience, which activates when you connect a compatible Pixel device to an external display. This desktop mode provides a taskbar and freeform window management on the external monitor while leaving your phone’s screen free for other tasks. When you connect a mouse, you can seamlessly move the cursor between displays to control both screens with the same peripheral. Currently, there’s no way to disable this seamless mouse movement, but that’s set to change in the next quarterly Android release.

PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced.

Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles.

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community.

If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

    "body": "Credit: Apple It seems like there’s a new chapter in the phone thickness war. Samsung launched the slim Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, and now Apple has launched the slightly slimmer iPhone Air . We’ve even seen this war extend to foldable phones in 2025. Apple claims the iPhone Air is just 5.6mm thin. However, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge and most other phones, this measurement doesn’t include the camera bump. You only need to look at the picture above to realize that it has a sizeable camera bump. In fact, it might be larger than the S25 Edge’s camera housing.",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Leaked CAD renders reveal the design of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 Pro, which closely resembles its predecessor, the Galaxy S25. The device is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display and an updated camera bump similar to the Z Fold 7. The new leak also reveals dimensions and display size, though there are some discrepancies with previously leaked dimensions. With practically all current-generation flagships already launched, it’s time to look forward to what’s coming to us in the next generation. We’ve already seen leaked renders for the Galaxy S26 Edge , followed by renders of the Galaxy S26 Pro and Galaxy S26 Ultra , albeit from a different leaker. Thanks to new leaked renders, we’re now getting a second look at the Galaxy S26 Pro. Android Headlines and OnLeaks have shared CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 Pro, a phone that is expected to succeed the Galaxy S25.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Google has relaunched the Pixel Referral Program for the Pixel 10 series, giving users 10 codes to share. A referral code provides a 10% discount on a new Pixel phone for the buyer and gives the referrer a $50 store credit. The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

And for good reason! These are fantastic phones. From the standard Pixel 10 to the Pixel 10 Pro XL and even to the outrageously expensive Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Google has delivered a lineup that is refined, intelligent, and a joy to use. I’ve already bought the Pixel 10 Pro , and I have a strong feeling it will be my pick for the best phone of 2025. But as much as I love it, I can’t shake the feeling that something’s missing. Actually, five somethings are missing.",
