    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR McAfee’s latest Scam Detector update focuses on stopping scams before you click, scan, or reply. Real-time QR code scanning is a major upgrade, helping users avoid fake login pages and malware-filled sites instantly. Improved social message analysis makes it easier to catch scams that look like normal conversations. Online scams keep getting more advanced and harder to notice. Scammers use tricks like fake QR codes on restaurant tables and urgent messages from hacked social accounts to blend in with daily digital life. McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply. If you’ve ever paused before clicking a strange link or scanning a code in public, this update is meant for you.",

Brighter blue areas indicate a higher density of dark matter. Researchers used Webb data to find the dark matter — which is invisible — via its gravitational influence on regular matter. The area of sky shown here is 0.54 square degrees (about 2½ times the size of the full Moon) and located in the constellation Sextans. Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) peered at this region for a total of about 255 hours. Dark matter doesn’t emit, reflect, absorb, or even block light, and is therefore not visible to the human eye or traditional telescopes. But it does interact with the universe through gravity, and large clumps or clusters of dark matter have enough mass to curve space itself.

And for a lot of us, that includes a new question we need to consider: Should I be paying for better AI? While something like Google Gemini can do a whole, whole lot for us without making us pay one extra dime , there are also people who are willing to pay a shocking amount of money for unfettered access to the best AI tools around. Between those extremes, Google’s AI Plus plan emerged as a nice balance of affordability and feature set — and now Google’s making it available to Gemini users everywhere.

Bezel controls and a circular playfield make it feel natural on a smartwatch. The game isn’t finished or publicly available yet, but it’s a promising proof of concept. Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

Last year’s Galaxy S25 Ultra features an 8-bit display that uses a software technique to simulate 10-bit color. Samsung Galaxy S26 rumors have been heating up lately. In recent weeks, we’ve seen credible rumors about color options , storage configurations , materials , and more. Today, a new rumor says we should expect a fairly significant display upgrade. Samsung’s 2025 Galaxy S lineup uses display panels with 8-bit color depth, which are capable of reproducing about 16.7 million discrete colors. Prolific leaker Ice Universe tweeted this morning that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will feature a 10-bit panel, drastically increasing the number of colors the phone’s screen can display.",

Astronomers have long sought evidence to explain why&nbsp; comets &nbsp;at the outskirts of our own&nbsp; solar system &nbsp;contain crystalline silicates, since crystals require intense heat to form and these “dirty snowballs” spend most of their time in the ultracold&nbsp;Kuiper Belt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Oort Cloud. Now, looking outside our solar system, Webb has returned the first conclusive evidence that links how those conditions are possible. The telescope clearly showed for the first time that the hot, inner part of the disk of gas and dust surrounding a very young, actively forming star is where crystalline silicates are forged. Webb also revealed a strong outflow that is capable of carrying the crystals to the outer edges of this disk. Compared to our own fully formed, mostly dust-cleared solar system, the crystals would be forming approximately between the Sun and Earth. Re…",

Spotify music videos feel so normal now that it’s easy to forget they’re still officially a beta feature. That’s a good thing, because it means some of the rough edges are still being ironed out.

OnePlus added that it will restore the ability to downgrade in its next regular software update. OnePlus drew the ire of some enthusiasts last week when it emerged that new firmware for select devices introduced Anti-Rollback Protection (ARB). This hardware-level protection measure means users would brick their devices if they tried to downgrade the software or install a custom ROM. Fortunately, OnePlus has revealed that this isn’t a permanent state of affairs. OnePlus told Android Authority in an emailed response that this was a temporary measure to boost security:",

The recently unveiled Galaxy Z TriFold is an impressive piece of technology. While the design and the heft may feel less practical than a standard book-style foldable, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the limitations are easily offset by its utility. The TriFold is essentially a large Android tablet that fits in your pocket, and it may be the perfect device if you fancy using three apps side-by-side. And if you’re in the US and have been waiting to lay your hands on the Galaxy Z TriFold, we have good news. As promised , Samsung is officially bringing the Galaxy Z TriFold to the US, and eager customers will be able to buy it starting Friday, January 30. The pricing for the Galaxy Z TriFold with 512GB storage is set at $2,899, and it will be available through Samsung’s online and offline retail stores.

Without this fix, these devices would slowly break. Once the certificate expired, they’d lose access to Apple’s servers and core features. The update is about functional life support, not new features; devices remain on old iOS 12 and many modern apps won’t work. Supporting a smartphone for more than a decade sounds almost impossible with how quickly new models come out these days, as in the case of Android models . But this week, Apple did just that by releasing a software update for iPhones that were first released more than 10 years ago. Apple has quietly released iOS 12.5.8, a surprise update for legacy hardware that can’t run modern versions of iOS, as spotted by a Reddit user . This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the original iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 and 3, and even the sixth-generation iPod touch.",

The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access.

It includes several improvements, including better compatibility with both stock Qualcomm and Turnip drivers. On Android, there’s a new quick settings menu accessible during emulation. Despite Nintendo’s Play Store DMCA , the Switch emulator Eden remains in very active development, with the team dropping its first major update of the year today. It’s the first minor version bump in the history of the project, bumping it to version 0.1.0. The update fixes several regressions from version 0.0.4, as well as long-standing bugs from its Yuzu ancestor. As a result, popular games like Metroid Prime 4 and Luigi’s Mansion 3 are now more playable than ever, with fewer crashes and graphical glitches.",

Samsung is widely expected to launch a so-called Wide Fold later this year, which will apparently offer a wider folding screen than its previous Galaxy Z Fold devices. Now, a Korean outlet has revealed more details about the product. ET News reports that Samsung plans to produce one million Wide Fold units in 2026. It notes that this would be the most units produced for a special edition foldable phone. By contrast, Samsung reportedly shipped just 30,000 Galaxy Z TriFold units and 500,000 Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition units. However, a source told the outlet that Samsung could still produce more Wide Fold units depending on the market response.",

After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Gemini in Google Calendar can now suggest meeting times that work for all attendees. The feature compares calendars, working hours, and conflicts, making it well-suited to group meetings. If multiple people decline an invite, Calendar can now suggest a better time to reschedule. The way it’s progressing, Google will soon know when your meeting is before you do. Back in October, it introduced the Help me schedule feature , which helped you suggest sensible meeting times based on your availability and the context of an email. That was useful, but it still left you to find out if the time worked for the other party. This latest update takes a bigger step by figuring out when everyone is actually free. According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar. When you’re creating an event, you’ll see a Suggested times option that uses Gemini to scan attendee availability, working hours, and existing conflicts, then surface the time slots that make the most sense for the whole group — assuming you have access to those calendars. Unlike October’s email-centric appr…",

Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

When Google first rolled out its AI photo-to-video tools in Google Photos, the idea was nice, but the execution could feel a little hit-or-miss. You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

Keep in mind, real-world network performance varies by location, so national rankings may not reflect individual user experiences. Verizon has taken a reputational hit over the last few years. There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues. Most recently, Verizon suffered a major service outage that affected a large portion of customers across its network . Despite its current reputation, Verizon is still far from down and out.

This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.

On the heels of that announcement, it seems another announcement from the company could come soon. It appears the company has a new wearable in the works and a leak has shared the first details.

Despite their somewhat legally dubious origins, Android gaming handheld makers have taken a lot of steps toward legitimacy in recent years. The big players, like Retroid, AYN, and AYANEO, don’t ship devices with any copyrighted material, and most now offer some sort of warranty on products. However, that hasn’t stopped scams from popping up in other parts of the web, prompting AYN to send out a warning message this morning. The company writes that it has received reports of unaffiliated websites selling its products online. These range from overpriced resellers to outright scams, and the company warns that it “cannot guarantee any sort of protection if you purchase from non-AYN sites.” The company also notes that only emails from addresses ending in @ayn.hk are official AYN staff members.",

You wouldn’t be the only one who has this passing thought on a monthly basis. Verizon in particular tends to spark strong opinions whenever we cover it, especially as prepaid plans keep getting more competitive. After my colleague’s thoughts on the topic, we decided to ask you whether there’s a good reason to leave Verizon right now or if it’s worth sticking with it for the time being. We stuck the poll in Andrew Grush’s own back-and-forth article over whether he should finally leave Verizon himself . The move to prepaid made sense on paper, especially after paying off most of the devices on his account. But once Verizon started stacking discounts and even offered a temporary free line, the math wasn’t quite as clear-cut to him anymore. He wasn’t suddenly Verizon’s biggest fan, but the extra incentives slowed his urgency to jump ship.",

Dynamic Color will reportedly tint blurred panels, helping the new transparency effects blend with your wallpaper and theme. Android 17 is still months from its official launch, but it’s clear that Google plans to change how you use your phone. After years of flat, solid colors, the next version — codenamed “Cinnamon Bun” — is said to focus on translucent, blurry backgrounds. We saw the seeds of this change planted last year with the introduction of Material 3 Expressive , which brought subtle blurs to the notification shade and the Quick Settings panel. Google wanted to create a sense of depth so that the user interface felt lightweight rather than like a heavy, opaque wall of color blocking your view.",

With the AI boom, Google wants to make information accessible without any significant effort, and is extending these principles beyond web search. Last month, it extended the same altruistic virtues to Google Drive, where you now see AI overview-style summaries for your folders . With this change, Google’s AI will look through your folders, any directories within them, the files stored in them, and even the contents of those files, so you can find whatever you’re looking for immediately. These “smart” features in Google Drive are available to all paying Gemini subscribers and Workspace users. Google says it saves time and helps you discover files buried under several layers of folders. But I’m deeply unsettled by Google raking through my files — especially without my explicit consent — and the only solution I feel I have now is to stop trusting Google with anything private.",

I’m not suggesting that ads aren’t the source of essential cash flow for developers and services, but considering my experiences with deceitful ads and unskippable disruptions, I’ve taken a firm stand.",

At least he ordered it for professional reasons (I think), but no one who excitedly pre-ordered the T1 phone has seen any sign of it yet. That hasn’t stopped Trump Mobile from thinking about what comes next. According to a company executive, a higher-end “T1 Ultra” may also be in the works. The Verge spotted a largely overlooked interview from November with Trump Mobile executive Don Hendrickson. Speaking to Wireless Dealer Magazine at the time, Hendrickson teased a second phone before the first one had made it into customers’ hands.",
