The Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum artist announced via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 8) that he would not be performing at The Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland, New Zealand, as originally scheduled for tonight. “Dear Auckland, I’ve done everything I can,” he wrote on Instagram. “I just can’t shake it. It breaks my heart, I’ve probably missed three shows in the last decade. I pride myself on showing up no matter what. Just couldn’t do it this time. Please forgive me.” Fans reported that they didn’t discover news of the cancellation until arriving at the venue. The late notice left many frustrated and disappointed, particularly as some had travelled long distances to attend Jelly Roll’s first-ever New Zealand performance. The cancelled concert was set to wrap Jelly Roll’s tour across Australia and New Zealand, which marked the country-rock star’s first-ever visit to the region. The run included back-to-back shows at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena (Oct. 28–29), a sold-out night at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena (N…",

Appearing on the Nov. 6 episode of Bunnie Xo’s Dumb Blonde podcast, the multi-genre artist opened up about the relationship’s end with surprising clarity, saying: “We’re two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” He added that the “Sk8er Boi” singer helped him “grow up,” and that he&#8217;s now more secure in his identity than ever before. The former couple met in early 2021 while collaborating on music, and their joint single “Flames” dropped just weeks later. A whirlwind romance followed, with Mod proposing in Paris in April 2022. Less than a year later, the pair called off the engagement in February 2023. Though Lavigne has remained publicly silent on the split, Mod has continued to speak openly. In July 2023, he released the breakup track “Strangers,” with lyrics detailing the rise and fall of their relationship. The Paris-shot music video — filmed in the same city where he proposed — added further emotional weight. On the podcast, Mod said that his perspective on the breakup has shifted over time: &#8220;We&#8217;re two different people, but I…",
