    "body": "Saturday Night Live paused its year-end Christmas episode on Saturday night (Dec. 20) to pay tribute to Rob Reiner, honoring the filmmaker’s early and influential role in the show’s history. Just ahead of the episode’s goodnights, SNL aired an on-screen tribute card featuring Reiner during his time on the program. The gesture came less than a week after Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead in their Los Angeles home. Their son, Nick Reiner , has since been arrested and charged in connection with their deaths. While Reiner became best known for his work as a director — including This Is Spinal Tap , The Princess Bride and A Few Good Men — his relationship with Saturday Night Live dates back to the show’s earliest days. Reiner hosted the program’s third-ever episode on Oct. 25, 1975, at a time when the series was still defining its identity. Unlike the show’s first two hosts, George Carlin and Paul Simon, Reiner fully participated in sketches throughout the episode, helping establish the host-as-performer format that would become central to SNL ’s structure. The episode is now considered a foundational moment in the show’s evolution. Reiner was joined during th…",

During Saturday night’s (Dec. 20) Ariana Grande–hosted episode, the show closed with a sketch that doubled as a farewell for Yang, who recently confirmed his departure after more than seven years at SNL . The scene cast Yang as a Delta Sky Club employee working his last shift, quietly aware that something is ending. What followed was a stripped-back rendition of the Eagles’ “Please Come Home for Christmas,” with Ariana Grande joining in — and, moments later, Cher stepping into the frame. Earlier in the day, Yang acknowledged his exit in an Instagram post, thanking Grande for how the episode handled his sendoff. “thank you to ari for sending me off in the dreamiest way i could imagine,” he wrote. In a longer message, Yang reflected on his time at SNL , offering a characteristically self-aware goodbye. “I’m grateful for every minute of my time there,” he wrote. “I learned about myself (bad with wigs). i learned about others (generous, vulnerable, hot). i learned that human error can be nothing but correct.” Yang f…",
