As has become a Billboard tradition, we’ve been spotlighting these Hot 100 first-timers throughout the year, celebrating their first appearances and sharing their reactions to the news. Now, as we ease into 2026, here’s a look back at all the acts who made their Hot 100 debuts in 2025 and the songs that turned them into Hot 100 hitmakers. The 2025 class of first-timers was particularly notable: four of the Recording Academy’s 2026 best new artist nominees — Olivia Dean, KATSEYE, sombr and Leon Thomas — earned their first Hot 100 hits in 2025. (Best new artist nominees Addison Rae, Alex Warren and Lola Young charted for the first time in 2024, while The Marías earned their first entry in 2022.) Dean debuted with her breakout single “Man I Need,” which reached the top 10, and followed with four additional entries. KATSEYE arrived in June with “Gnarly” and scored its first top 40 hit in November with “Gabriela.” Sombr hit the top 10 in November with “Back to Friends,” his first chart entry, and continued his momentum…",

While not much is shown, the image of a ball rolling down stairs suggests this could be the next challenge the company intends to address. Dialing up the brightness, we see what appears to be a vacuum with a new arm-and-wheel locomotion system. We’re just about one week away from CES 2026 getting started, and tech companies have already been lining up to tease their new hardware announcements ahead of time. Last year, at CES 2025, we saw Roborock push the limits on what we’ve come to expect from robot vacuum hardware with the reveal of the Saros Z70 and its articulated arm for picking up small items. Today we’re getting a preview of how Roborock is planning to follow that one up, and it sure looks like the next frontier for the company’s vacuums could be navigating stairs.

But while the biggest stars of rock, hip-hop and more packed stadiums, comedians were road warrior-ing their way to sold-out theaters and arenas. Here, we’re looking at the five biggest comedy tours of November 2025. Earlier this year, Billboard launched its comedy hub with rundowns of the biggest touring comedians of the midyear Boxscore period (Oct. 1, 2024 – March 31, 2025) and of the months that followed. Sebastian Maniscalco, Matt Rife and Weird Al Yankovic topped those lists, but another former chart-topper bulldozes ahead atop the November recap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Nate Bargetze’s fifth month at No. 1, and fourth in a row. He first dominated in May, and then returned for August, September and October. He’s grossed $13.2 million from 182,000 tickets across 13 shows. Not only is this the fourth straight month for Bargatze above $10 million, but it’s also the fourth in a row where he’s the only comic to pull eight figures. &nbsp; He went back-to-back with double-headers in Seattle (Nov. 6-7 at Climate Pledge Arena), Portland, …",

One thing that comes across loud and clear is the degree to which sequels and franchises have come to dominate the marketplace. Just five of the year-end box-office champs were films that were not part of franchises (or did not spark a franchise or a reboot of some kind). Those five films that stand alone are E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Ghost, Titanic and Barbie. Star Wars is the top franchise on this recap, with six installments that have been the year’s top-grossing film. Batman is runner-up, with four installments that finished first for the year. Spider-Man is third, with three installments that yielded the year’s top box-office hit.

Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has quietly listed the Exynos Modem 5410 on its website. This modem is expected to appear in some Galaxy S26 models. The new modem is very similar to the old one, but offers improved efficiency and more robust satellite capabilities. Samsung announced the Exynos 2600 processor earlier this month, and it’s expected to power some Galaxy S26 models. We know that the Exynos 2600 will be paired with an external modem, but Samsung has just announced a new modem that will apparently be paired with the processor. Samsung quietly listed the Exynos Modem 5410 on its website (h/t: r/Android ), and a leaker previously claimed that this will be the modem in all Exynos-powered Galaxy S26 variants. So what makes this modem stand out from the Exynos Modem 5400?",

In short, I’m starting to wonder if a portable projector might be a safer route for my family’s living room entertainment than a constantly present massive black screen.

The update is based on Android 16’s initial release, not newer QPR builds, so some later features aren’t included. Installing LineageOS requires unlocking the phone and manually installing new software, which may not suit everyone. That relic of a device that’s gathering dust in your drawer might still have a lease of life in it yet. Google officially stopped updating the Pixel 4 back in 2022, but the phone is now getting Android 16 anyway — just not from Google. As spotted by Android Police, the LineageOS team has officially added support for the Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL as part of LineageOS 23 . The Pixel 4a, 4a 5G, Pixel 5, and Pixel 5a are also now supported. That’s the project’s Android 16-based release, and the “official” status means the maintainers consider it stable enough for everyday use, with core features working as expected.",

The duo is set to launch in China on January 8 and may be exclusive to the market. However, they are rumored to launch globally under the Nord series. OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

That’s pretty long range, and as a very, very, very amateur astronomer, I wondered whether OPPO’s lens kit would be a gateway to some even more amateur astrophotography. Given the rise of brilliant camera phones , computational photography, and dedicated astrophotography modes, I set out to answer whether smartphones are finally catching up to entry-level telescopes for casual sky-watching. Before I braced myself for the cold, I did some quick math to set my expectations. “My Newtonian telescope has a 750 mm focal length, just bright enough to make out nebulae and galaxies on a dark night, such as Andromeda, with a 28mm lens (27x magnification).",

As convenient as wireless charging can be, it’s proving to be just as much of a headache in terms of compatibility , but without the fast charging times to help justify it. However, whenever I pick a new phone to be my daily driver or recommend a new model to friends and family, I’ve recently started making sure they come with robust wireless charging capabilities.

Moreover, routers haven’t become easier to use or included any exciting new features in the past decade. In fact, I’ve been disappointed by the lack of innovation by companies like Google that have only gone as far as making smartphone apps for easier setup or improving mesh connectivity. So when I came across the Beryl AX — a Wi-Fi router claiming to disrupt the status quo on both, price and features — it piqued my interest. The device in question comes from a relatively young manufacturer, GL.iNet, that has mostly built its reputation on compact routers over the past few years. And on paper, it’s quite the disruptor: it can fit in a pocket, has 2.5Gbit Ethernet, uses USB-C for power, and packs more useful software features than routers that cost hundreds of dollars.",

Data centers powering AI software have been gobbling up memory supplies in recent months, driving up the cost of both flash storage and RAM. This memory crunch is leading to higher manufacturing costs for consumer goods like smartphones, and new reporting suggests that big players like Samsung and Apple will raise prices on their 2026 releases to keep up. Korean-language outlet Aju News reports that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 Ultra will be the first major smartphone release to come with a price hike caused by the current memory shortage; the phone is expected to cost 10% more than Xiaomi 15 Ultra that was released in March. The report goes on to say that the next generation of smartphones generally, including the Galaxy S26 and iPhone 18, will also see higher launch prices.",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

The catch is a 24-month repayment agreement tied to bill credits, effectively locking customers in long-term. It’s convenient upfront, but buying a phone outright can still be cheaper and more freeing, if you can afford it. All three major postpaid carriers are known for offering free phone promotions to new customers, so you don’t need to pay for a device up front. In reality, these “free” phones often cost much more in the long run than you would pay if you bought a phone outright and paired it with prepaid service. Still, many people would rather pay more over time than come up with a larger amount all at once. Until now, this practice was mostly unheard of in the prepaid world, but that’s beginning to change with Total Wireless . Not only is the company introducing a free phone offer that works similarly to those from the larger carriers, but it will also now offer comparable device repayment plans.",

Because the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket upon which they will launch is not yet at the launch pad, the crew boarded Orion inside NASA Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building, where engineers are conducting final preparations on the spacecraft, rocket, and ground systems. During the rehearsal, teams went through all the steps that will be taken on launch day, winding the clock down to just a few seconds before liftoff. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars, for the benefit of all.

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",

Initially, I thought I would use this all the time, but I soon realized that the issue was with the multi-window mode itself, and how it displayed a tiny part of both apps and made using either of them clunkier.

Android vs. iOS is a theme that shrouds our conversations, both online and in person, even though visual coherence between iOS and Android skins keeps increasing. However, what if we told you phones made by Apple and Google had more in common than we already know? Despite the fierce rivalry between Google and Apple, both tech giants use the same manufacturer to produce Pixel devices and iPhones . It’s widely known that Apple does not manufacture its own products and relies on a Chinese-origin Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) company, Foxconn, to handle the bulk of iPhone production. In addition, it also contributes to manufacturing a part of the supply of the iPad, MacBook, AirPods, and even the Apple Watch.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a single-row floating input box for Gemini’s primary interface to reduce visual clutter and simplify the user experience. The Gemini overlay could gain a new “Tools” icon to house advanced features, such as Deep Research and Canvas. We’ve also spotted “Gemini Labs,” which could be a new settings area where users can toggle and test experimental AI capabilities. Last week, we spotted Google working on improving Gemini’s input box , giving it a cleaner and uncluttered look with fewer buttons. The look we managed to surface was clearly a work-in-progress, as the UI elements lacked proper spacing. With the latest Google app release, Google has addressed this UI issue and also introduced other UI changes that further advance the Gemini UX 2.0 revamp .

This means you can expect a consistently high level of image quality at this zoom range. Xiaomi confirmed earlier this week that the Xiaomi 17 Ultra will launch on Christmas Day in China, while also revealing a few tantalizing camera specs. Now, the manufacturer has announced that the device has a cutting-edge periscope camera. Xiaomi announced on Weibo that the Xiaomi 17 Ultra offers a 200MP continuous optical zoom camera. This means that the lenses and other components inside the camera module shift to achieve optical zoom, and therefore consistent image quality, across a range of zoom levels. This is in line with many conventional standalone cameras.",

    "body": "Credit: Paul Jones / Android Authority TL;DR Camera specs for the Samsung Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57 have apparently leaked online. The Galaxy A37 could get a welcome main camera upgrade but retain similar secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A57 might not deliver camera hardware upgrades. The Galaxy A36 and Galaxy A56 led the mid-range charge for Samsung in 2025, but we’ve already heard a few leaks about the Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57. The latest leak has just outlined apparent camera specs. SmartPrix dug into leaked software and discovered purported camera details for the Galaxy A57 and Galaxy A37. Starting with the A57, the new phone is tipped to arrive with a Sony IMX906 main camera (50MP, 1/1.56-inch), a 13MP ISOCELL S5K3L6 ultrawide shooter, and a 5MP macro camera. The outlet explains that some regions might get the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ main camera instead, which has the same sensor size as the IMX906. A 12MP sensor (ISOCELL S5K3LC) will apparently handle selfies and video calls.",
