The band revealed details of the project on Friday (Jan. 17), with founding member Fat Mike confirming the film’s status while appearing at The Punk Rock Museum’s NOFX exhibition. According to Fat Mike, the documentary does not shy away from the most extreme, uncomfortable or self-destructive chapters of the group’s history. “Most people wouldn’t be OK with releasing a film that shows footage of getting whipped in their dungeon, or their drug use for the past 20 years, or dressing up like a rubber cheap whore, or the ambulance ride when they were naked while puking and shitting blood… I’m not like most people,” Fat Mike said. Directed by James Buddy Day, 40 Years of F**kin’ Up traces NOFX’s evolution from teenage punks to one of the most influential and polarising bands in modern punk history. The documentary features extensive interviews with the band’s core lineup — guitarist Eric Melvin, lead guitarist El Hefe and drummer Erik Sandin — all of whom also serve as executive producer…",

Kicking down doors for female performers in both country and pop music, she has soared in the worlds of books, television, philanthropy and movies &#8212; and pretty much whatever else she tackled. On Jan. 19, Parton &#8211; who has topped the Billboard Hot 100 twice and Billboard &#8216;s Hot Country Songs a whopping 25 times &#8212; is turning 80 years old. Her expansive roster of hits reads like a “best of” list of the 1970s and 1980s, and it remains one of the strongest song catalogs of any singer-songwriter in any genre. As a writer, she has penned everything from poignant, detailed ballads about life in the Great Smoky Mountains, where she grew up, to some of the most defining love songs of all time. Her prowess as a songwriter and performer is so great, it earned her a historic induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022 &#8212; an accomplishment she almost didn&#8217;t accept, telling Billboard at the time that she didn&#8217;t feel like she &#8220;measured up&#8221; to past inductees.

Ed Sheeran , R3hab , Seeb, Shawn Mendes , Clean Bandit , Elvira , Bleachers , LP Giobbi and The Chainsmokers are among those tapped to turn Swift’s work into something new. Alternate versions of her tracks like “Everything Has Changed” from Red ; “Wildest Dreams” from 1989 ; “Delicate” from Reputation ; “You Need to Calm Down,” “Lover” and “Cruel Summer” all from Lover ; “willow” from evermore ; “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) ; “Anti-Hero” and “Lavender Haze” from Midnights ; “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” from The Tortured Poets Department ; and “The Fate of Ophelia” from The Life of a Showgirl are perfect, whether your dance floor is at the club, in your living room or at a wedding reception.

The record is crafted to be consumed from start to finish, with the narrations advancing the plot and the songs bringing a range of emotional highs and lows.
