Hayden Bower thinks so.&nbsp; Bower, who leads AllTrack, the industry’s newest PRO as of 2017, says he was inspired by the rise of independent musicians making and releasing music from their bedrooms. “If you look at the marketplace in the early 2000s, ASCAP and BMI [the two leading PROs in the United States] combined had about 350,000 or so members. Today, they have 2.5&nbsp;million members. Meanwhile, the U.S. population only grew 18% in that time,” Bower says. “Technology opened the floodgates.” Bower defines this surge as the formation of a “significant middle class of professional or aspiring professional songwriters,” and he says he saw an opportunity to serve those creators’ specific needs with a PRO that manages not only performance rights but also mechanical and neighboring rights. And by founding a new organization, he says he has avoided taking on the baggage of nearly a century of old catalog and metadata that plagues the incumbents. “The [others] were basically competing for the same narrow sliver of top-tier talent,” Bower says, pointing to the opaque ways that PROs court that talent by, for instance, offering…",

The mission will chart the heliosphere’s boundaries to help us better understand the protection it offers life on Earth and how it changes with the Sun’s activity. The IMAP mission will also provide near real-time measurements of the solar wind, data that can be used to improve models predicting the impacts of space weather ranging from power-line disruptions to loss of satellites, to the health of voyaging astronauts.

Session 1 (Sept 17 at 6 PM ET): Introduction to EMERGE and GLOBE. You’ll learn how students can collect mosquito habitat and land cover data with the free GLOBE Observer app, then complete a guided coding assignment to visualize those observations on maps and explore connections with NASA satellite data. It’s a friendly environment for people who haven’t coded before! Session 2 (Sept 24 at 6 PM ET): We’ll regroup to review the coding assignment—troubleshoot issues, share sample outputs, and discuss strategies for adapting the lesson in classrooms, afterschool programs, and libraries.

    "body": "NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will help scientists better understand our Milky Way galaxy’s less sparkly components — gas and dust strewn between stars, known as the interstellar medium. One of Roman’s major observing programs , called the Galactic Plane Survey , will peer through our galaxy to its most distant edge, mapping roughly 20 billion stars—about four times more than have currently been mapped. Scientists will use data from these stars to study and map the dust their light travels through, contributing to the most complete picture yet of the Milky Way’s structure, star formation, and the origins of our solar system. Our Milky Way galaxy is home to more than 100 billion stars that are often separated by trillions of miles. The spaces in between, called the interstellar medium, aren&#8217;t empty — they&#8217;re sprinkled with gas and dust that are both the seeds of new stars and the leftover crumbs from stars long dead. Studying the interstellar medium with observatories like NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal new insight into the galactic dust recycling system.
