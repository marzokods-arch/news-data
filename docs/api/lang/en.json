To ensure that each member’s individual charm could shine, they adopted a distinctive three-unit structure: the Vocal Team (Woozi, Jeonghan, Joshua, DK, Seungkwan), the Hip-Hop Team (S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, Vernon), and the Performance Team (Hoshi, Jun, The8, Dino). Of course, what always came first was SEVENTEEN’s teamwork as 13 members. But it’s undeniable that the Performance Team, in charge of the group’s choreography and stage presence, the Vocal Team, led by producer Woozi and carrying the melodies of SEVENTEEN’s songs, and the Hip-Hop Team, adding a free-spirited vibe, are what make SEVENTEEN such a dynamic group.&nbsp; SEVENTEEN have also pursued notable unit projects. The three-member unit BSS released two single albums, while Hoshi X Woozi — leaders of the Performance and Vocal Teams — dropped their first single album BEAM earlier this year and successfully wrapped up a fan concert tour.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is testing a new feature in Chrome for Android that automatically requests the desktop version of websites when used in the new Desktop Mode. The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.

This means Google must now implement several changes to the Google Play Store within 14 days. The changes include allowing developers to link to alternative download methods, use external payment systems, and set their own prices. In July 2025, Google lost an appeal against the original Epic vs Google lawsuit , which meant the company had just 14 days to make sweeping changes to the Google Play Store. Google appealed to the Supreme Court after this decision and also separately filed for a stay until its appeal is decided. Unfortunately for Google, the Supreme Court has declined the company’s request to temporarily stay parts of those sweeping changes from taking effect. The net result? Google now has 14 days once again to change several Google Play Store policies. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

We’ve uncovered evidence of Nano Banana preparations in Google Lens and Circle to Search. The Lens integration appears slightly further along, and mirrors what we’ve already seen from Search AI Mode. Nano Banana might be the best thing to happen to Google’s AI offerings in a while, and over the last few weeks we’ve had a lot of fun checking out what the system can do — even if it does seem to struggle a little with varying aspect ratios . We’ve already seen hints that Google has big plans for the tool, like integrating Nano Banana with Search AI Mode , and today we’re looking into a few more places where Nano Banana appears to be getting ready to make an appearance.

From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",

I tested more or less every major alternative to Google’s popular browser and found a better option for my personal wants and needs. Samsung Internet has more features, offers superior customizability, and comes with a few extra security options. Despite what many think, it can be downloaded to just about any Android phone , so it’s not exclusive to Samsung devices. Most people just default to Chrome, as it’s the most well-known and readily available browser on all smartphones. But I urge everyone to at least try out Samsung Internet to see that Chrome has fierce competition.",

Previously leaked code suggests that the feature will enable an AI assistant to answer and transcribe calls automatically. New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. One UI 8.5 is destined to be the next big update for Galaxy phones and tablets, and it will be a bigger deal than One UI 8. Leaks suggest that Samsung will reserve most of its newer features and bigger changes for this x.5 release. We have also found out that One UI 8.5 will be based on Android 16 QPR2 , which will also bring all the new QPR features to Samsung’s devices. We’ve also spotted that automatic call screening is coming to Galaxy phones , and it seems Samsung still has more improvements in the pipeline for this feature.

Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G.

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
