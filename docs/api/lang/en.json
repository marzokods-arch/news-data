While we’ll have to wait not too long to get our hands on the first consumer devices, we went hands-on with a reference handset at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit that gives us some indication of the chip’s peak potential. Just a word of caution: retail handsets are unlikely to perform quite as well, owing to their more consumer-friendly form factors and prioritization of battery life and other features over raw chipset performance. As for the specs of the reference unit, Qualcomm paired its 8 Elite Gen 5 with a massive 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM, 1TB UFS4.1 storage, and a 6.8-inch 3,200×1,440 AMOLED LTPO display. So, a very high-end setup.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube has started trying to verify if its users are adults or not. When the system can’t make a prediction on its own, users have been asked to provide documentation proving their age. For those who haven’t, many have started seeing their YouTube accounts locked down to child settings. YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone. The site has long struggled to take appropriate measures to protect its young and vulnerable users, while still letting adults enjoy more mature material — within reason. Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history. When that fails, or Google’s unable to make a guess with much confidence, YouTube offers these users the opportunity to manually establish their age by submitting something like an…",

If your Garmin Vivoactive 6 has been draining faster than you’d like, it’s worth checking your wearable for a new update. A fresh beta (version 15.05) appears to be rolling out with three main changes, including a fix for the battery drain bug and a new gesture that lets you dismiss notifications by briefly covering the screen with your palm. As spotted by NotebookCheck , Vivoactive 6 owners in Garmin forums said the update had landed even without official release notes. One poster listed the main aspects of the update , which also lets you open your Morning Report and Evening Report from the watch’s Notification Center.",

We’ve come to expect 5G connectivity and the high data speeds that it enables as standard features over the past few years. Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

    "body": "Of all the features that the Google Pixel 10 series brought, Daily Hub was the one that intrigued me the most. I love the idea of my phone greeting me with immediately relevant information before I start my day. And, as it’s made by Google, I could expect all the relevant content from my many Google apps and services to be included, right? Not quite. The early version of Daily Hub was as useful as a wet piece of toast. As a result, the company quickly yanked it to polish it up a bit. This loss didn’t affect me too severely — I don’t own a Pixel 10, but I craved a similar feature, albeit with a few more customizations. So, naturally, to achieve my vision, I turned to Google’s generative AI for assistance. Could I use Gemini to serve me with a Daily Hub equivalent? I gave this idea a whack, and here are my findings.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are facing a “scratchgate” controversy due to widespread scratches on demo units. The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

Meanwhile, it has also concluded testing for the Galaxy Watch 7, indicating a stable update may be coming soon. Samsung recently rolled out stable One UI 8 to the Galaxy S25 series and has been testing beta builds on nearly a dozen other flagships and mid-range devices. Besides phones, the One UI 8 Watch is also set to arrive on a range of supported Galaxy Watch models. While the Galaxy Watch 8 series came preinstalled with One UI 8 Watch, the Watch Ultra followed soon after. Meanwhile, a beta has been underway for the last generation Galaxy Watch 7 series, and the program is now being extended to the older Galaxy Watch 6. According to a user’s post on Samsung Community forums , One UI 8 Watch beta is now available for the Galaxy Watch 6. It’s safe to presume that the update also applies to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, as the two devices share the same hardware.",

We previously reported that Google may be planning to merge Chrome OS and Android, unifying the two operating systems. This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",

    "body": "TL;DR This past summer, Gmail tested adding a “mark as read” option to Android notifications. That’s now ready to roll out widely, and should be hitting Gmail users everywhere. Email may have a reputation as being a bit clunky and inelegant compared to texting or DMs for quick conversation, but with it as broadly compatible as it is, we still find ourselves falling back to it over and over again. Sometimes it even feels almost as easy as texting, and you don’t even need to fully open an email to get all you need from it, and the info in your notification is more than enough. If that sounds like your experience, you’re going to be a big fan of Gmail’s new notification option. It’s been a couple months now, but this past summer we started getting reports from users about a new option showing up in Gmail notifications, no longer just letting you delete an email or start crafting a reply to it, but now letting you directly mark it as read , right from the notification. While we saw multiple Gmail users getting access, this was also far from generally available, and it looked like Google was still testing the feature out.",

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds. The move could pressure other Android manufacturers to abandon their own proprietary fast charging solutions and adopt universal standards. USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds. This trend could soon be a thing of the past, as a few upcoming Android flagships are confirmed to support 100W USB PD PPS charging. Xiaomi has confirmed that the upcoming Xiaomi 17 series is fully compatible with 100W PPS charging.",

What started as a simple way to get extra cloud storage and some benefits has morphed into a Frankenstein bundle of AI perks no one asked for, leaving users like me wondering what we’re actually paying for. The reality is that Google is pushing its AI agenda on Google One subscribers, and it’s starting to really bother me.",

Reddit users suggest verifying eligibility carefully through support channels and checking billing statements before activating new SIMs. T-Mobile does have some great plans and offers , but the carrier also hiked prices on its legacy plans earlier in the year.

The OnePlus 15 is coming soon, and its updated design is already making rounds on the internet. Multiple rumors in the past have hinted at the redesigned camera bump on the upcoming flagship. And we recently came across purported hands-on images of the OnePlus 15 , which highlight the changes on the back. Although the authenticity of these images could not be ascertained, another teaser from earlier today suggests this change might be legitimate after all. The teaser does not come from OnePlus, but its parent company OPPO, which is set to unveil its flagship Find X9 series on October 16. That is just one day after the reveal of ColosOS 16, which has been confirmed to drive the OnePlus 15 in China. OPPO has been teasing the Find X9 series over the last couple of weeks.

These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next?

The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Verizon’s Visible brand is expanding with limited in-store availability through Best Buy. Customers can now sign up at Best Buy locations, with SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and basic support provided. Plans and features remain the same as online, though some in-person services may involve Geek Squad fees. As T-Mobile announces a new CEO and its commitment to a digital-first experience (meaning more focus online and less in-store), Verizon’s digital-first brand Visible is taking a different approach . To be clear, Visible will not be opening its own stores or abandoning its online-first model, but customers can now sign up for service directly at Best Buy locations nationwide. Best Buy will provide SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and face-to-face support for customers who are interested in Visible but turned off by its current online-only model. Ultimately, this move is about giving consumers more ways to sign up, though the plans and features remain the same as those available online.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new voice and song search UI in the Google app beta. The redesign uses animations in the style of AI Mode and removes recent searches. The test appears to be server-side, so only select users will see it so far. Google seems to be testing a refresh of the way voice search looks inside the Google app , including the Shazam-like song search section. To the surprise of no one, the redesign makes it feel more in line with the company’s AI features. As spotted by Telegram user @shishirverm, the change has started showing up in version 16.36.40.sa.arm64 beta of the Google app. Right now, tapping the microphone icon in the Google app or the home screen widget brings up a screen that says “listening…” and some recent searches plus search suggestions underneath. If you press the “Search for a song” button, you get another page with an animation and a small prompt to play, sing, or hum a song.",

Current COO Srini Gopalan will take over as CEO. Goplan has prior executive experience at Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone UK, and Bharti Airtel. T-Mobile states that Gopalan will lead a strategy focused on becoming a data-driven, AI-enabled, digital-first company while continuing 5G and next-generation network expansion. It has been five years since Mike Sievert took over John Legere’s role as T-Mobile CEO, closing a chapter in the Uncarrier’s history that is still remembered as a golden age among many of the carrier’s biggest supporters. Now, the winds of change have returned, with T-Mobile announcing that Sievert will step down on November 1, moving to the role of vice chairman. The last time T-Mobile changed leadership, the company’s identity shifted significantly. Whether the next CEO will bring similar shakeups or a more subtle transition remains to be seen. What is known is who will take the reins and the general direction T-Mobile says it will pursue.",

The audio device has a feature called the “energy slider.” It’s currently unknown what this slider does. Nothing’s sub-brand, CMF, began teasing its first-ever pair of headphones last week. Called the Headphone Pro , there’s not much known about the device yet, other than you’ll be able to customize it with different earpad colors. With the launch only a week away, the company has now shared a new detail about its upcoming audio product. Similar to Nothing’s Headphone 1 , the CMF Headphone Pro will have an assortment of differently-shaped buttons and controls. Among those controls is a feature that looks a lot like a volume slider. However, it appears this slider may not be for controlling volume, as the company calls the feature an “energy slider.”",
