That puts it at No. 24 on Billboard ‘s list of music biopics with the highest worldwide grosses. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic – for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.) But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the highest-g…",

There’s a lot to like Credit: Zac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority The feature I love most in Samsung Internet is the split-view mode, along with the sidebar. Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI. This has been great for researching and writing articles, as I can have my writing and two research tabs open all in one place without switching windows.",

That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles).

Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses. And even though I’m not too fond of making every wearable “smart,” if glasses could handle nutrition tracking for me, I’d happily throw my wallet at them.",

The company reportedly plans to shut down less-profitable stores and cut staff across remaining locations, while expanding AI automation to fill the gaps. It’s unclear if other big changes will be announced around this time, though it’s possible that there’s more to this coming shift than just layoffs. Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?

    "body": "TL;DR Fitbit’s food-logging tools, including search and barcode scanning, are down for many Android and iOS users. Recent and frequent foods still work, but new items can only be added manually with limited nutrition data. Fitbit says engineers are investigating the server-side issue, but there’s no ETA on a fix yet. Fitbit is more than just a step-tracking watch . In fact, it also helps millions stay on top of their daily nutrition. But if you tried logging meals today and found the search bar empty or the barcode scanner unresponsive, you’re not alone. According to multiple reports , Fitbit’s food-logging system is experiencing a widespread outage affecting both Android and iOS users. Over the past 24 hours, people who rely on Fitbit’s food database or barcode scanner have been unable to search for new items or scan packaged goods. Favorites and recent entries still appear in the Log Food section, but trying to look up anything new typically results in a blank screen or a “fitbit.com is down for maintenance” pop-up. Support reps have confirmed this isn’t an isolated glitch and say engineers are actively investigating the issue.",

As a result, we occasionally see some users report that an ad blocker has stopped working on the website. This time, however, it appears that YouTube has rolled out a big update that made the website unusable for a large number of viewers who have their ad blockers enabled.

    "body": "TL;DR Play Store reviews can be a useful resource for learning about apps, but they lack a search tool. You can currently filter reviews by score, date, or even specific topics, but you can’t add new topics yourself. It’s not yet functional, but some new code strings in the Play Store app suggest that Google’s working on a review search tool. Reviews have to be one of the most frustrating-to-navigate components of life online — one that we nonetheless find ourselves returning to time and time again. When you don’t know exactly what the best option for you is just yet, a good user review can really be illuminating. But finding that good one can sometimes require trudging through screens of low-quality submissions, AI slop, and even the work of paid shills. If you’re looking for some help finding the one review that really speaks to your needs, the Google Play Store appears to be working on a tool that might be right up your alley.

This data will be sent back to Google, which will use it to optimize results before a broader launch. Users will also be able to try out new hypertension alerts and receive $25 as compensation. Google’s Pixel Watch 4 appears to be significantly lacking in features compared to the Galaxy Watch 8 , particularly in terms of health-related metrics. That said, Google is working to plug this gap and is experimenting with two new features that will warn users of any looming illnesses. These features are currently under trial with Fitbit Labs, and a small group of users can participate in testing them ahead of others. With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals. According to 9to5Google , a new feature called “Unusual Trend Detection” has been added to Fitbit Labs , a program that allows users to evaluate new features before they are rolled out to a broader user base.",

And while platforms like Midjourney have allowed you to share your AI creations with others, the new Sora app takes things one step further — it allows you to add your own face and voice to the video.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak .

However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update.

Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department.

Google Maps is the go-to navigation app for Android phones globally, and it has a number of handy features to help you get from A to B.

This special version of the Gemini model will be used to power the next generation of Siri. This represents Apple’s desperation to enter the AI race, especially with its inability to build a model comparable to Google’s Gemini. Voice assistants from tech brands like Google and Amazon have recently undergone significant enhancements powered by AI. Both Alexa+ and Gemini, which has replaced Google Assistant , are now available to users for testing and critique. In the meantime, Apple’s ambitions to catch up to its competitors with Siri continue to drag on . Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner . Over the weekend, Bloomberg ‘s Mark Gurman reported that with the expected timeline for releasing a revamped Siri drawing closer, Apple has decided to use Gemini to power Siri’s next generation.

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",
