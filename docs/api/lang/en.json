We cannot confidently say whether One UI 8.5 will arrive on the Galaxy S22 or not. The One UI 8 update train is pushing ahead at full steam, and there’s no stopping it. In a matter of a few weeks, Samsung has rolled out the update to the last three generations of flagship bar phones and foldable devices, along with some tablets and affordable A-series phones. Now, it’s trickling down deeper and reaching the Galaxy S22 series , which started to receive its first One UI 8 update. The stable One UI 8 update has arrived for the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra, as highlighted by noted Samsung tipster Tarun Varun on an X post . It weighs in at about 3.2GB and upgrades the Android version to 16. The update is available to a user in Turkey, so a global rollout can be expected to follow soon.",

Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu has revealed a variety of purported details about the OnePlus 15T, which will likely be the OnePlus 15s if it launches outside China.

Naturally, it seems like a perfect fit for Pixel users. However, Google didn’t invent the diary app. In fact, plenty of other journal apps have existed on the platform for years, each offering something a little different.

Android 16 has been out for several months for Pixel users, weeks for several Galaxy and (surprisingly) Motorola and Sony users , but nowhere to be found for the rest of the Android gang.

The best features, such as Ask Home and Home Brief, of the newly introduced Google Home experience, unfortunately, require a subscription . The Standard and Advanced tiers of the newly introduced Google Home Premium subscription replace the existing Nest Aware and Aware Plus monthly plans.

    "body": "Twenty years before Taylor Swift &#8216;s &#8220;The Fate of Ophelia&#8221; was recorded, a character named Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) was leaning into his uniqueness with a magnificently awkward dance routine, as seen in a memorable scene from the 2004 coming-of-age comedy Napoleon Dynamite . His sweet moves were soundtracked by Jamiroquai&#8217;s &#8220;Canned Heat,&#8221; but anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen the movie &#8212; and who happens to stumble upon the fan-made &#8220;Ophelia&#8221; x Napoleon Dynamite mashup making the rounds &#8212; just might think the choreo was meant to be paired with Swift&#8217;s 2025 single instead. Because it&#8217;s actually perfect. Swift fan @betterspiritsprintco on Instagram posted the funny edit on Friday (Oct. 3), the release day of the pop star&#8217;s twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl , which is already setting records ; as of press time on Sunday, the Instagram post has been liked by more than 63,000 Instagram accounts.

Written and directed by Swift herself, the music video for &#8220;The Fate of Ophelia&#8221; made it online Sunday night (Oct. 5). The reference-filled visual has the pop star playing several parts, or showing several sides &#8212; among them the once ill-fated Ophelia of William Shakespeare&#8217;s Hamlet , the lead in a Golden Age Hollywood movie musical, a frontwoman to a 1960s girl group, and the modern Swift showgirl that audiences know and love. Of course, Swift&#8217;s single imagines an Ophelia who makes her way out of a destined tragic ending. In the accompanying music video (seen below), Swift crawls out of an on-set version of a Sir John Everett Millais painting circa the 1850s that famously depicts Ophelia&#8217;s drowning. She performs different iterations of a &#8220;Fate of Ophelia&#8221; show &#8212; in homage to the likenesses of Marilyn Monroe in one scene and Ronnie Spector/The Ronettes in another, and center soundstage in an Anything Goes -inspired ensemble &#8212; and ends up so…",

In the case of one unlucky Galaxy Ring user , battery swelling turned a well-fitting device into a finger trap, grounding his flight plans and sending him to the ER. The fear of having a ring of any kind stuck on my finger is very real. That’s exactly what happened to tech creator Daniel (@ZONEofTECH). According to Daniel, after his Galaxy Ring’s battery failed, soap and hand…",

Google’s AI tool has captured the interest of anyone who deals with numerous large documents and files, becoming essential for thousands of students, lawyers, marketers, and more. We even use it here on Android Authority to make some of our internal guides interactive. Just ask a question and get the answer straight from the documentation. NotebookLM is fantastic for that. It’s a powerful search tool, study buddy, and assistant in one. Plus, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools trained on quasi-infinite data; it just uses the sources you give it, so you know you’ll be getting a proper answer. My problem with it is that it hides the source away when it’s a PDF file, and that really limits its usefulness for anything other than text.",

I’ve already mentioned why Spotify Duo is perfect for my household, and then there’s Spotify Connect, which lets me control music on my PS4 and other devices through my phone. I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

Still, I’m sure we all know a few holdouts, or you might be one yourself. A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths . Many of those points still hold, but awareness has improved, and so has prepaid market penetration. When you remove some of the most common myths from the equation, what are the real reasons people still don’t switch to prepaid? I dug into the most common ones I hear from friends, family, and online communities. Here are the biggest reasons some people say prepaid isn’t worth the switch.

    "body": "TL;DR Leaked builds show Samsung’s next One UI 8.5 update, debuting with the Galaxy S26, will be based on Android 16’s second quarterly release (QPR2). This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence. We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements.

Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route.

If they didn’t have enough crime happening around them, eufy encouraged users to film themselves pretending to be package thieves. It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models. And this week we’re learning about a clever way one company looked to crowdsource an effort like that — even if it cut a few corners along the way.

This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay.

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority While Verizon and T-Mobile both like to make a lot of noise these days, AT&amp;T has sort of fallen into a position where it’s not a bad network per se, but it’s hard to feel too excited about it. As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well. That said, there are plenty of great alternatives to AT&amp;T if you are willing to give prepaid a chance.",

The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",

Samsung’s rollout of One UI 8 is catching up in pace. While it is much more timely compared to its laggard One UI 7 rollout, it feels like a mere version upgrade with few changes. However, to ensure we have no complaints, it is also working on a significant update with One UI 8.5, which is expected to arrive with the Galaxy S26 series in the coming months. We’ve already spotted nearly a dozen new features in One UI 8.5 and are learning about a quite useful addition. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could introduce partial screen recording, which would allow only a selected portion of the display to be captured and displayed in the video. The feature was spotted in a leaked One UI 8.5 test build and reported by leaker Ice Universe on Weibo .",
