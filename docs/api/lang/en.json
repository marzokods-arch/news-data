The Paramore frontwoman, who recently announced an expanded run of dates due to high demand, said she intends her shows to be explicitly inclusive spaces — and made clear that anyone who holds discriminatory views should not expect to feel comfortable attending. In a new interview with Clash , Williams said she wants the tour to be a place where every fan can “feel welcome to the party,” but added that this commitment also requires her to take a public stance about who she does not want in the room. “I don’t want racists around, and I don’t want sexist people around, and I don’t want people there who think that trans people are a burden,” she said. “I think that’s a hard line for me now.” Williams explained that she hopes anyone holding those beliefs will “walk in the door and realise that the gang’s all here, all banded together around something positive,” adding: “All are welcome if you believe all should be welcome… If you don’t believe that, you’re not welcome.” Her upcoming tour — which supports her latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — The North American leg kicks off on March 28 in Atla…",

The Australian-born artist, who has shifted her focus to entrepreneurial and digital ventures in recent years, reaffirmed that she does not plan to return to the music industry. The update came via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 28), when the “Fancy” rapper shared a selfie that prompted a fan to ask whether she had recently signed a new record deal. “F*** no,” Azalea replied in the comments. “But I did consider signing, for weeks. I’m very sure I don’t want to come back to the music industry.” Her comment follows years of gradual distance from major releases. Azalea’s last studio album, The End of an Era , arrived in 2021 and marked a personal milestone, intended as a closing chapter before a pivot to new creative paths. Her 2014 debut, The New Classic , made a global impact with the Billboard No. 1 single “Fancy” and established her as one of the most commercially successful Australian rappers of the decade. Earlier this year, Azalea publicly alleged on X (formerly Twitter) that Universal Music Group owed her what she described as “millions of dollars in back pay” from international royalties.
