The device was a smart speaker that looked like a cross between an Amazon Echo Dot and an Apple HomePod Mini. While Google has yet to say anything about the smart speaker since the teaser, a new report may have revealed some details. According to strings in version 3.41 of Google Home for Android (via 9to5Google ), this unannounced device may be called the “Google Home Speaker.” This is interesting as it signals a departure from the Nest branding and a homecoming to the Google Home naming scheme.

The agency notes that it received 33 reports of fire and explosion incidents. About 481,000 units were part of the recall. Electronics manufacturer Anker isn’t exactly having its best year. In June, the company recalled PowerCore 10000 power banks due to safety risks. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) revealed that the recall covered over 1 million units. Later that month, Anker ended up recalling several more power banks. Now the USCPSC is providing more details on this second recall. Just as a refresher, the second recall affects the Anker Power Bank (model A1257 and A1647), Anker MagGo Power Bank (model A1652), and Anker Zolo Power Bank (model A1681 and A1689).

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s Phone app has historically forced a portrait orientation while making calls. Users have recently noticed that this no longer holds true, and some devices set to auto-rotate will turn even in calls. We’re not seeing this behavior consistently across devices, and it’s unclear if it’s truly intended. The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

The hardware is scheduled to launch in March 2026. Today, AYANEO launched the Pocket AIR Mini , providing a full look at the device, its specs, and price. In addition to this launch, however, the company had a surprise up its sleeve that we didn’t see coming. This surprise is a different handheld that is slated for early next year. While details are light at the moment, AYANEO did volunteer some information about the hardware. Clearly inspired by the Pocket S in both design and name, the device is called the AYANEO Pocket S Mini. As AYANEO describes it, the Pocket S Mini is a “high-performance retro 4:3 handheld.”",

Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

This feature allows users to switch to the “Recents, Home, Back” layout, which is the default on Samsung Galaxy phones. We discovered evidence for the new setting in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, but the setting isn’t live yet. For years, Samsung phones have defaulted to a three-button navigation layout where the back button is on the right and the recents button is on the left. In contrast, Google’s Pixel phones use gesture navigation out of the box but offer a three-button option with the traditional Android layout — where the back button is on the left. The problem is that there’s never been a way to flip the button order on Pixels. This poses a challenge for Samsung users switching to a Pixel, as they have to retrain their muscle memory or switch to gesture navigation.

It’s a basic wireless charger that, yes, can go up to 25W wirelessly, but does so at the expense of terrible heat dissipation.

The device in question was the T1 Phone, the first phone from a brand new company called Trump Mobile. Trump Mobile is both a new carrier and phone company started by President Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump. The T1 Phone was, at the time, sold as a made-in-America, gold-plated Android phone that looked alarmingly close to an iPhone. On the back was an enormous “T1” logo above an American flag.",

In this time, I have used book-style foldables from Samsung, Google, HONOR, OnePlus, vivo, HUAWEI, Tecno, and more.

This marks a significant shift for the platform, turning it from a simple data hub into a fitness tracking service. Last week, we reported that Google was bringing native step tracking to Health Connect , allowing the app to count your steps using your phone’s sensors. This marks a significant shift for the app, which currently doesn’t track any data on its own and instead acts as a hub for information from other health and fitness services. While that was its original purpose, it seems Google has bigger plans for the platform . This change suggests Health Connect could transform from a simple data hub into a full-fledged tracking platform, with native step counting being just the first step.

The system renders these icons with a highlight around the edge, and at the wrong angle, an illusion can make them appear tilted. In motion, the effect should be far less noticeable, but screenshots can still look very off. There’s plenty of ribbing back-and-forth, some of it good-natured, some of it not, between Android and iOS users. Passionate fans on both sides of the fence love talking about how their preferred platform is making great strides with intuitive design and effortless usability — and often can’t help but feel a little bit of smug satisfaction when things go spectacularly wrong for the other guys. Apple’s Liquid Glass design for iOS 26 has been controversial since almost day one, and with the update now widely out, users have spotted one decision that’s leaving them feeling a little off-balance. We’re looking at how app icons are rendered in dark mode with Liquid Glass in iOS 26, as highlighted here on Reddit’s iOS sub by user tantunidevourer (via AppleInsider ):",

It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker.

So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

And yet, here we are, with a shiny iPhone Air hot off the presses, making what I think are all the same mistakes that Samsung made. Maybe Apple’s top-to-bottom optimization will prove me wrong, but I’ll be disappointed if the iPhone Air starts falling into familiar traps. Here’s why I’m worried — and why you should be too.",

Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",
