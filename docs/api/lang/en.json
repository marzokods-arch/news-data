    "body": "After a nearly 40-year wait, Megadeth achieves its first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. The metal band’s new self-titled set, which also marks its expected final studio album, debuts atop the list dated Feb. 7. Megadeth made its Billboard 200 chart debut in 1986 and has placed 23 albums on the ranking through its career. Until this week, the band had gone as high as No. 2, with 1992’s Countdown to Extinction . The new self-titled album earned 73,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Jan. 29, according to Luminate — marking the act’s best week, by units earned, since the chart began ranking by units in December 2014. The bulk of that sum was driven by pure album sales (purchases of physical and digital copies of the album), totaling 69,000. That’s the biggest sales week for any Megadeth album since 1999, when Risk opened with 74,000 sold. The new album was released on Jan. 23, a day after the documentary Megadeth: Behind the Mask was released in movie theaters. The band’s farewell tour kicks off on Feb. 15 in Victoria, British Columbia. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumpti…",
