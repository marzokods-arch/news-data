This “bouncy” makeover rolled out to Gemini just two months ago, and it seems Google is back to the drawing board. We’ve now spotted the company working on a new animation for the Gemini overlay, although the verdict is still out on whether this new animation is better than the current one.

Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

The OnePlus 15’s display is officially confirmed to be brighter and features smaller bezels. OnePlus is also using a dedicated chip from OPPO to ensure fast performance of the 165Hz display. The OnePlus 15 is arriving soon as one of the earliest truly global smartphones with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. While its global launch is rumored to precede the OnePlus 13’s availability timeline, the phone will actually be released first in its home country, China, where the company has been dropping teasers for the phone one after another. One of the biggest upgrades on the OnePlus 15 is the new 165Hz display, which the brand has already confirmed. Its prowess and improvements to high-intensity gameplay have also been vouched for in a pre-launch gaming review . Now, OnePlus is revealing more details about the display in a series of Weibo posts. For starters, the display is again made by BOE, which has been supplying displays since the OnePlus 12.",

Having access to smartphone apps that have no real desktop equivalent is a game-changer, and I’m not just saying that because I write for Android Authority . Unfortunately, Microsoft sunset its Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) experiment earlier this year, which allowed you to run Android apps on Windows 11 . And while Phone Link does still exist, it only allows you to mirror your smartphone’s screen. Moreover, Microsoft still hasn’t enabled screen sharing support for Pixel and the vast majority of other smartphones. So if I want the best of Android on PC, I have to choose between a Chrome OS device or an emulator.",

In a post titled “ Just turned my e-reader into a Spotify player ,” the user introduced Kindlify.co, a minimalist web interface that can turn your Kindle into a Spotify remote control.

The beauty of Android is that it dynamically adapts to various formats and screen sizes almost seamlessly (surprisingly, it took Google so long to realize it would also work well on laptops !). This virtue has allowed Android to drive the resurgence of various ignored or abandoned form factors, such as decade-old Blackberrys . For Nintendo DS and 3DS fans specifically, it has led to the emergence of Android gaming handhelds armed with not one but two screens . After products from noted portable console makers, including AYANEO and AYN , another manufacturer — ANBERNIC — is throwing its hat into the ring with a new dual-screen handheld. And it is much more affordable than any of the existing options. ANBERNIC just dropped a teaser for its upcoming dual-screen handheld, called the “RG DS.” Unlike its bland name, however, the handheld is shown in jazzy colors, including a glossy red, a lustrous blue, a retr…",

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

Some of this is expected, such as your Social Security number, home address, and payment details. Beyond that, carriers also enable settings that allow them to collect data from your web browsing, location, and more. While they do not directly access this information themselves, it is used to build advertising profiles and personalize your experience. It is also not just for internal use. The big three carriers share, and in some cases sell, personal information to other companies for targeted ads or credit checks. When you consider the steady stream of high-profile security breaches carriers have faced in recent years, it is understandable if the idea of handing over even more data makes you uneasy.",

OnePlus promised that the OnePlus Watch 2 would receive its Wear OS 5 update in Q3 2025 , but the company clearly missed that deadline . There has also been no word from the company on when the newer OnePlus Watch 3 will receive its Wear OS 6 update. Until now, that is, as we finally know when OnePlus smartwatches will be receiving their next Wear OS updates. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Developer samples will be sent out soon to improve third-party GPU drivers. The AYN Odin 2 remains one of the most groundbreaking and popular Android gaming handhelds on the market, so when the AYN Odin 3 was announced, the hype was off the charts. That only compounded when it was revealed that it would be one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite gaming handhelds, with the crowdfunding campaign finishing at just over $1 million raised a few days ago. But in the month since the campaign started, very little has been revealed about the device itself. Unlike AYANEO, which typically has a working sample unit before announcing anything to the public, AYN did not appear to have a working prototype. At least, until now.",

But for every reader excited to see hues on their home screen, there’s another who swears grayscale is best. From the Kobo Libra Colour to the Boox P6 Pro series, color displays (like Kaleido 3 panels) are on the rise. These models cater to readers who want graphic novels, children’s books, textbooks, and other visually rich content to look the way they were intended. Even menus, app icons, and book covers pop with a little color. Meanwhile, highlights and scribbles (on stylus-supported models) also stand out more vividly, which is likely why Amazon just launched a colorful Kindle Scribe , and reMarkable’s Paper Pro Move now sports a color display too.",

This year, the Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Plus are reported to arrive with Exynos 2600, while the Edge and Ultra will have Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Despite this, phones in the US and in China will continue to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all models. If there’s something Samsung should be praised for, it is its grit and relentlessness. The company has experienced various setbacks but has recovered from them just as quickly. And it may now be working to remove another thorn by addressing longstanding issues with its Exynos lineup. The rumored Exynos 2600 is expected to be Samsung’s first chipset based on a 2nm process, and the company has already begun mass-producing it. While earlier reports speculated on the possibility of the chipset being used for one of the Galaxy S26 phones in certain regions, a recent report claims the strategy may already have been finalized. Following last month’s news establishing the likelihood of Samsung’s Exynos 2600 to be used inside the Galaxy S26 Pro — the smallest and most affordable of the lot , SamM…",

Google had a perfect window to grace its book-style foldable with the right mix of updates, leapfrogging the Galaxy Z Fold 7… but it didn’t. Instead, it’s given the Pixel 10 Pro Fold the bare minimum, and I just can’t get excited about it.",

I’m so glad I tried it, as it has added significant utility to my minimalist, productivity-focused home screen. Let me offer a brief tutorial if you aren’t familiar with Edge Panel or have never used a Samsung phone. The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface. These devices offered a gimmicky tapered screen edge where icons were placed, effectively turning the side of the phone’s screen into a secondary display packed with shortcuts. The idea was solid, but I never appreciated the execution.",
