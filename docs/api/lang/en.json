    "body": "This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download , our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology. Solar geoengineering startups are getting serious Solar geoengineering aims to manipulate the climate by bouncing sunlight back into space. In theory, it could ease global warming. But as interest in the idea grows, so do concerns about potential consequences. A startup called Stardust Solutions recently raised a $60 million funding round, the largest known to date for a geoengineering startup. My colleague James Temple has a new story out about the company, and how its emergence is making some researchers nervous. So far, the field has been limited to debates, proposed academic research, and—sure—a few fringe actors to keep an eye on. Now things are getting more serious. So what does it mean for geoengineering, and for the climate? Read the full story . —Casey Crownhart This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

    "body": "Solar geoengineering aims to manipulate the climate by bouncing sunlight back into space. In theory, it could ease global warming. But as interest in the idea grows, so do concerns about potential consequences. A startup called Stardust Solutions recently raised a $60 million funding round, the largest known to date for a geoengineering startup. My colleague James Temple has a new story out about the company, and how its emergence is making some researchers nervous. So far, the field has been limited to debates, proposed academic research, and—sure—a few fringe actors to keep an eye on. Now things are getting more serious. What does it mean for geoengineering, and for the climate? Researchers have considered the possibility of addressing planetary warming this way for decades. We already know that volcanic eruptions, which spew sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, can reduce temperatures. The thought is that we could mimic that natural process by spraying particles up there ourselves. The prospect is a controversial one, to put it lightly. Many have concerns about unintended consequences and uneven benefits. Even public research led by top institutions has faced barriers—one famous…",

    "body": "At a regional hospital, a cardiac patient’s lab results sit behind layers of encryption, accessible to his surgeon but shielded from those without strictly need-to-know status. Across the street at a credit union, a small business owner anxiously awaits the all-clear for a wire transfer, unaware that fraud detection systems have flagged it for further review. Such scenarios illustrate how companies in regulated industries juggle competing directives: Move data and process transactions quickly enough to save lives and support livelihoods, but carefully enough to maintain ironclad security and satisfy regulatory scrutiny. DOWNLOAD THE ARTICLE Organizations subject to such oversight walk a fine line every day. And recently, a number of curveballs have thrown off that hard-won equilibrium. Agencies are ramping up oversight thanks to escalating data privacy concerns ; insurers are tightening underwriting and requiring controls like MFA and privileged-access governance as a condition of coverage. Meanwhile, the shifting VMware landscape has introduced more complexity for IT teams tasked with planning long-term infrastructure strategies.&nbsp; Download the full article This content was p…",
