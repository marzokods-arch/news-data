    "body": "Every year at the end of November, Americans gather around tables short and long with family and friends to enjoy a meal with those for which they are most thankful. We take note of our blessings and privileges &#8212; and make more happy memories to be grateful for in the future. Of course, that spirit of thankfulness shouldn&#8217;t come only once a year. We should always take stock of all we have to appreciate every morning and every night, and if you need some musical motivation to get you in the grateful mood, we have some suggestions. There are so many people you can be thankful for. You can be grateful to a romantic partner who saw the best in you even when you didn’t believe in yourself; a long-time friend who’s always had your back; a family member who deserves a bit of praise and a reminder that they made you who you are; or even an ex-lover or enemy whose tough words helped you become all the stronger for having survived them. Whoever you have in mind, there’s something on this list to dedicate to the people who shaped you that&#8217;s worth singing out loud in the shower, in the car and all over town. From Ariana Grande to Alanis Morissette, Celine Dion to Ozuna, FKA T…",
