As previously reported , a judge determined that the friends’ conversations about the working environment on set are relevant to Lively’s sexual harassment and retaliation claims against co-star and director Justin Baldoni. Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, prevailed in court last June on the issue of Swift’s text messages, which have taken center stage in Lively’s&nbsp;lawsuit. Some of those have come to light. This week, several batches of back-and-forths have been released in which Baldoni is allegedly labelled a “doofus director,” a “clown” and a “bitch” who runs with a “gaggle of supervillains.” In one exchange from December 2024, labelled “Exhibit 89” and seen by Billboard , Swift apparently references a favorable published story on Baldoni, quipping: “I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin.” Swift also likens the broader situation with Baldoni and others to “a horror film no one knows is taking place.” In an earlier message, chunks of which are …",

Unihertz will showcase the phone in March, and a Kickstarter will follow soon. Through 2025, there have been frequent attempts to create devices that replicate BlackBerry’s impact. In addition to projects dedicated to reviving older BlackBerry phones , we recently witnessed the announcement of Clicks Communicator , a compact phone with a QWERTY keypad. Clicks is the same company that began selling cases for iPhones and some flip-style foldables with built-in keyboards only a few years ago. Meanwhile, another company with several years of pedigree is ready to join the race. The Unihertz Titan 2 Elite is the latest step in that direction. Unihertz is no stranger to phones with physical QWERTY keypads . It has been dabbling with them for well over five years, filling the gap left by BlackBerry’s decline.",

If you want the absolute best camera on an Android phone, you’ll pretty much have to gravitate towards an Ultra flagship. We’ve seen the likes of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra raise the bar for what they can do, and we’re expecting more of the same with the vivo X300 Ultra and the OPPO Find X9 Ultra , too. At least with OPPO, a new leak suggests the company is not only going to pack a great camera into the Find X9 Ultra flagship but also equip it with an insane 300mm telephoto extender accessory.

You can now ask about events or create new meetings across secondary calendars using natural language. But just as that update rolled out, security researchers shared a worrying new finding about how Gemini can be exploited to access someone’s private and confidential Calendar information.",

The event is traditionally held every year on the fourth Thursday of January, as all three astronaut accidents happened around the end of the month. “On NASA’s Day of Remembrance, we pause to honor the members of the NASA family who lost their lives while pushing the boundaries of exploration and discovery,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. “We remember them not to retreat from risk, but to respect it — to learn, to improve, and continue onward. Their sacrifice and the strength of their families will forever inspire us as we continue to reach for the stars and pursue the secrets of the universe.” Isaacman will lead an observance at 1 p.m. EST at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia,…",

Two dark stripes on opposite sides of the bright point (upper left) are its protoplanetary disk, a region where planets could form, and the disk’s shadow, cast across the large envelope of material around the star. Material accumulates onto the protostar through this rotating disk of gas and dust, a product of the collapsing cloud of gas and dust that gave birth to the star. Where the shadow stops and the disk begins is presently unknown. To the center right, an outflow cavity reveals a fan-shaped reflection nebula. The two stars at its base, HBC 340 (lower) and HBC 341 (upper), unleash stellar winds, or material flowin…",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR The Google Phone app now supports landscape UI, meaning it will rotate if your system-wide auto-rotate is on. However, this feature apparently keeps getting added and removed between stable updates. Google also added a portrait lock toggle in beta releases, but the setting hasn’t made its way to the stable release yet, causing further confusion. Until Google makes up its mind, users can stop the unintentional rotation by disabling system-wide auto-rotate. Back in September 2025, users began getting annoyed when their phone calls switched to landscape orientation while using the Google Phone app. As it turns out, the Google Phone app had just started supporting landscape UI for calls , and users with auto-rotate enabled on their phones were seeing the intended behavior but mistakenly thought it was a bug. Users are complaining once again that the Phone app is turning to landscape, and, as before, it might still be intended behavior. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile store employees reportedly say credit card signups are now tracked as part of performance metrics. Customers may be flagged internally, prompting reps to offer the card proactively via SMS during a visit. You’re still under no obligation to apply, but don’t be surprised if the card comes up quickly and unprompted. If you’ve visited a T-Mobile store recently and felt like the credit card pitch came harder or faster than expected, that might be by design. New reporting suggests the carrier is pushing its branded credit card harder at the employee level than ever, making it far more likely to come up in everyday store visits. According to The Mobile Report , anonymous T-Mobile employees told the publication that credit card applications are now tied directly to an internal performance metric called ULB, which is short for Un-Carrier Leaderboard. If signups are tracked as part of how store employees are assessed, this will naturally encourage most reps to push the card on customers as much as possible.",

One of those was the lack of multiple calendar support. Without it, you couldn’t ask about events from secondary calendars, such as work, school, or family calendars, or create new ones there. It was silly, and people complained about this repeatedly ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) to deaf ears. Now, two years later, Google has finally fixed this stupid oversight and added back support for multiple calendars to Gemini, so any employee, family member, or student can access their full schedule again — with a few caveats, though.",

As per the leak, the Galaxy A57 could be slimmer than the A56, measuring only 6.9mm. The phone is also expected to feature Samsung’s Exynos 1680, a 50MP Sony primary camera, 45W charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. Samsung is on course to launch its flagship Galaxy S26 series later in February. Even before that mega event, though, Samsung could refresh its mid-range A series with noteworthy improvements to the cameras and the overall design. While the Galaxy A07 5G was unveiled last week , the A37 and A57 now appear ready for an official highlight in the coming weeks. Out of the two, the Galaxy A57 is already breaking cover with a fresh listing on TENAA , China’s telecom certification body. While some of the Galaxy A57’s specifications had already leaked, the listing also divulges a breadth of additional information, including its dimensions, display, battery, and more.",

Late last year, the company announced that it would finally begin testing Gemini for Home across its existing hardware line before releasing a new smart speaker later in 2026.

Its full-color, 60Hz screen paired with Android 14 offer more flexibility than many e-readers. The tablet is available now in Europe for around €369, with no US release confirmed. Most Android tablets focus on brighter screens and higher specs. The HANNspree Lumo takes a different approach, using a reflective LCD display designed to mimic the look of paper while still running full Android. It lands somewhere between a tablet and an e-reader, offering users a more comfortable everyday tablet experience. Instead of a traditional LCD or OLED panel, the Lumo features a 7.8-inch reflective LCD display that relies primarily on ambient light. The result is a matte, low-glare screen that’s easier on the eyes, especially compared to the backlit panels most tablets feature. HANNspree describes the Lumo as a “Dynamic Paper Tablet,” positioning it as a middle ground between traditional tablets and dedicated e-readers. Physically, the tablet is slim and lightweight, measuring about 6.6mm thick and weighing roughly 250g.",

It’s no secret that OpenAI is building an AI device that will somehow integrate ChatGPT to help you with responses in the physical world. It has been on the cards since 2024, when OpenAI joined hands with Apple’s former design lead Jony Ive , and then followed by acquiring Ive’s startup in 2025. While the exact nature of the device remains unknown, various hypotheses have emerged. For instance, a leaker last year suggested it could be an audio device shaped like a pen , while a more recent leak indicated it would be a pair of earphones with a previously unseen design . Although the details remain hazy, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane offered some visibility on the timeline.

After relaunching the Pocket 6 with two different control layouts, early shipments of the Android handheld are now being staggered thanks to a production slowdown tied to its OLED screen. In a Discord update to customers, the company said it will only be able to ship around 100 black Pocket 6 units next Monday, starting with the stick-on-top version. Retroid says the holdup comes down to OLED screen calibration, which has limited how many units it can get out the door during early production.",

Far off in the distance, we can see new ideas taking shape, but it’s often anyone’s guess how long it will be before they’re ready for prime time.

The company is rolling out a change that ensures any secondary calendars you own will always appear in your calendar list in Settings, making them easier to find and manage. Detailed in a Google Workspace Update , this move builds on a change Google introduced late last year, when it moved secondary calendars to a dedicated ownership model. Under that system, every secondary calendar has a single owner who’s responsible for its settings, permissions, and lifecycle.

Foldable users get meaningful tweaks, like control over how many favorite apps appear on the cover screen. However, turning on the blur option can cause animations to freeze and jitter. After weeks of compatibility headaches and half-baked beta support , Home Up — arguably the heart of Galaxy home screen customisation — now works with One UI 8.5 beta and gives you real control over your Galaxy home screen again. If you’ve played around with the One UI 8.5 beta on Galaxy devices, you were probably frustrated when Home Up and a handful of other Good Lock modules broke after the update. For weeks, users saw errors like “not compatible with your new operating system,” basically rendering beloved customisation tools useless.",

Verizon had a major outage last week that left a large chunk of its subscribers unable to access its network for many hours across the country. Verizon’s statement said affected users would be offered account credits for the network disruption, which turned out to be a rather paltry $20 per account, regardless of the number of lines.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus might finally fix the disappointing aspect of its flagships. It could finally bring the camera on par with other flagships, especially by including a 200MP primary sensor. However, it’s unclear whether this is for the OnePlus 16 or any other phone. OnePlus’ parent company, OPPO, has recently made significant strides with its flagship Find X series cameras, from using a large 200MP telephoto sensor to supporting external zoom lenses on the phone . Unfortunately, OnePlus has been deprived of these features, with the camera especially sidelined to improve performance in the latest OnePlus 15 and 15R phones. This, naturally, has drawn much criticism, which OnePlus now appears to be preparing to tackle with the next flagship — most likely, the OnePlus 16. While the launch of that supposed phone is still several months away, we’re already seeing early leaks, starting with speculation about the camera. Last month, leaker Digital Chat Station predicted that OnePlus’ next flagship would feature an upgraded 200MP primary camera. Now, another leaker, Yogesh Brar , is highlighting details about the other sensors in the phone’s camera setup…",

I used to think that as long as there’s no unauthorised access to my home internet network, I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Turns out, I was wrong. Learning how to harden your NAS can be annoying, but it pays off in peace of mind. You see, a modern NAS is not just a hard drive with a network cable; it is a fully functional server. Once you start enabling features that make a NAS useful, like remote streaming or file sharing, you are effectively opening it up to wide open internet and that means its time for you to start acting as your own IT department. The moment remote access enters the picture, your local-first device becomes a prime target for anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions.

Versions of this language have existed in Android’s system-level Package Installer since at least July 2025. This suggests that Google has been preparing the developer verification flow mentioned below for quite some time. That said, our reporting focused on the fact that this language has now appeared inside the Google Play app itself, which is a new development.

Before the end of the year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold .

But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool.
