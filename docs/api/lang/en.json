Named HiFi, the audio offering was first announced in 2020 but was rarely mentioned by Spotify executives in the years since.

While some of the strands fell back into the Sun, a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles. Launched in December 1995, the joint NASA-ESA SOHO mission, was designed to study the Sun inside out. Though its mission was scheduled to run until only 1998, it has continued collecting data, adding to scientists&#8217; understanding of our closest star, and making many new discoveries , including more than 5,000 comets.

    "body": "The Drag Prediction Workshop series is an extensive international effort to improve transonic aerodynamic predictions. This long-running collaborative effort seeks to mobilize the international aerospace community to improve the computational methods and tools to predict transonic aircraft performance, particularly drag. More details on the workshop can be found at the workshop website: https://www.aiaa-dpw.org NASA has a storied history with the workshop series from DPW-I (hosted in 2001) through the upcoming DPW-8, held in concert with Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop 4. In addition to code and methods improvements, the series also resulted in the NASA/Boeing Common Research Model ( https://commonresearchmodel.larc.nasa.gov/ ), an open-access, commercially-relevant aircraft geometry. This geometry has been extensively tested in many facilities throughout the world and been the subject of multiple workshop series. NASA&#8217;s contributions to the upcoming DPW-8 and subsequent work will be highlighted on this page.
