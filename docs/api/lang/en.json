Her second album, The Art of Loving , remains at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart for a third non-consecutive week, extending one of the year’s most consistent chart runs. The achievement adds to a standout year for women on the ARIA albums tally. Dean becomes the ninth female artist to land a No. 1 album in 2025, joining a list that includes Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde and Taylor Swift — a run that’s shaped much of the year’s chart narrative. Dean is also doubling up at the top. Her single “Man I Need” clocks a fifth straight week at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the fourth solo female artist to lead the singles tally in 2025, alongside Lola Young, Doechii and Swift. The year’s singles race has largely been driven by women, from Rosé’s extended reign with “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars to the surprise dominance of “Golden” by fictional K-pop group HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters .
