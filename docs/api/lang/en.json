Although Nova Launcher’s death knell has already sounded, my recent thoughts have turned to Sesame Shortcuts’ dim future.

Here’s how to do it, why you might want to think twice about it, and what you should consider before doing it.",

In a tragic, disappointing, and entirely unexpected move, there won’t be a second generation of Samsung’s ultra-thin flagship. And, as someone who has spent plenty of time with the Galaxy S26 Edge, comparing it to just about every other flagship out there, let me tell you, I’m shocked. Except I’m not. I’m not shocked, even a little bit. Samsung’s goal with the Galaxy S25 Edge was clear from the start: To mooch off the hype for Apple’s upcoming iPhone Air . It wanted to beat Apple to the punch, but in its haste, forgot how to make that punch land, and now there’s no escaping its most obvious copycat attempt yet.",

It helps me effectively manage my low self-control to use the phone, while allowing me to stay on top of notifications and important calls. If you, like me, willingly stick with Android and want to access apps that sync with your phone directly on your wrist, then Wear OS is your best option. Therefore, the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are two of the best smartwatches with Wear OS you can buy. The Galaxy Watch 8 and the Pixel Watch 4 are both from distinct lots that may not typically appeal to the same kind of users. If you already own a Samsung phone, and don’t mind sticking to the comparatively less restrictive ecosystem (than Apple’s) , the Galaxy Watch is the way to go. If you cherish the best of Google and want the latest features — which will eventually trickle down to all devices — from Wear OS, the Pixel Watch 4 may be the right pick for you.",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

Even if we’re already in the middle of a journey, Maps makes it easy to search for new destinations along our route, and add them as new stops in just a couple taps. While that works great, Google has never been one to leave well enough alone, and we’ve spotted the company’s developers working on what looks like a new approach to how we add destinations like that.

Last month, Google Sheets picked up additional Gemini functionality , gaining the ability call on Google’s AI to do things like explain how formulas work and automatically correct errors in formatting. Today, Google’s announced that Gemini can now do even more in Sheets, carrying out increasingly complex tasks on your behalf. In a blog post, Google has shared that new Gemini integration in Sheets can automate actions that involve multiple discrete steps.

One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance.

In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design. At the same time, certain outliers, like Nothing, challenge that notion by experimenting with unusual camera designs , secondary displays , and unusually tiny screens . Now, another leading Android manufacturer is experimenting with a subtle change that can radically alter the phone’s look by altering how the camera appears. OnePlus’ sister brand, realme, has just begun teasing its upcoming flagship with a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 . In addition to the new chipset, the realme GT 8 Pro is also the brand’s first phone to feature a camera developed in partnership with a ca…",

It won’t be long until we can share our full initial impressions, but we can talk a bit about the new camera setup, and it’s certainly shaping up to be impressive. That’s not particularly surprising. I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length. Paired with crops and upscaling from that huge 200MP camera, it can take photos all the way out to 40x (920mm).",

Unsurprisingly, it has me reaching for the iPhone camera more than ever before, and it’s making me wonder whether the Pixel 10 Pro really has my favorite camera system.
