I've had my eye on a few holiday horror releases like Sleep Awake and Routine, because of course I want to celebrate the most wonderful time of the year with tales of an insomnia plague and a haunted lunar base. Then there's Skate Story—which is about a less-haunted, but equally weird, moon—and Unbeatable, a rhythmic adventure game set in a world where music is illegal. December's schedule also features the usual end-of-year shows, including our very own PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted , and The Game Awards a week after. If you're still hurting for something to do, then keep on scrollin' to the end, where I've outlined the dates for Steam's Winter sale, games with big updates on the way, and even more new releases.

Every week, I'll be covering a topic relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. Greetings from a post-Thanksgiving stupor, FPS enjoyers. I had a nice AFK holiday with family, but in the back of my mind I was riding the high of the night before, when my friends managed to assemble a party of nine Master Chief Collection owners (shout out to the $10 Steam sale) to play classic Halo 3 custom games. It was a blast, and if you have any fondness for early Forge creations like Halo Jenga (seen below), I can't recommend it enough. The good times got me thinking about a PC gaming maxim that says an FPS is always better with mouse and keyboard. I was diehard about this for a long time—plenty of shooters feel fine on a controller, but I couldn't imagine a scenario where the precision of a mouse isn't a demonstrably better experience than thumbsticks.

Dark Souls has plenty of bosses to borrow from and the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is full of weapons that would transform how you approach each run.

Paralives has been in development for quite a few years at this point, and it will initially launch into early access while continuing to work on expanding the possibilities of its Live Mode simulation.

But Microsoft is now exhibiting 420BLAZEIT levels of AI hysteria by imagining that the logo for Copilot, a Windows 11 feature that nobody cares about or indeed likes, belongs on its 2025 ugly Christmas sweater. This year's sweater, dubbed \" Artifact ,\" follows the fuzzy XP hills , iconic Windows 3.0 logo, and successive sweaters featuring MS Paint, Minesweeper and Clippy. This year, Clippy returns as a prominent sweater feature, but he's joined by a hodgepodge of other Windows-related logos that frankly scream \"lazy clipart compilation.\" Which might actually be a perfect aesthetic for a nostalgic ugly Christmas sweater, what with the pixel art icons for MS-DOS, Paint, MSN and Internet Explorer. But then there's Copilot. Every other icon on the sweater dates back to the 1990s with the odd exception of the Minecraft Creeper, which already feels out of place. But what d…",

And the biggest crime of all: you can't play poker. For the past 15 years, our choices of casino games in New Vegas have been limited to slot machines, blackjack, and roulette. But finally, finally , one heroic modder has added video poker. And New Vegas, at last, feels more like Present Vegas as a result. The mod by W00Z, called wGames - Introducing Video Poker , adds a classic of the video poker genre: Jacks or Better. Belly up to the machine, place a bet, and you'll be dealt five cards. Click the ones you want to hold and you'll be given new cards to replace the discarded ones. If you've got a pair of jacks, you'll win your money back. Anything higher like two-pair, three of a kind, a flush, a straight, and so on, and you'll rake in the caps. With the mod installed these new video poker terminals can be found in The Tops, Gomorrah, the Atomic Wrangler, and all other New Vegas casinos, with a lovely detail that the card backs on each machine will vary depending on which joint you're gambling in.

Time heals all wounds though, and in recent years Konami has been doing a good job of gradually bringing Metal Gear back: first with the Master Collection Volume 1, which brought the first two Metal Gear MSX titles and three Metal Gear Solid games (plus spinoffs) to modern platforms. It didn't launch in the best way, but after a year of patching I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. Then this year brought Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a ground-up but faithful remake of the beloved MGS3 that impressed almost everyone . It may not be the glorious future this series deserves, but it showed that Konami could still kick it at the top table, and produce a Metal Gear game that looks and feels like it belongs in 2025.

The three animations are flat-textured and set to Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road, the song featured in GTA 6's first trailer. The first shows a male character removing what seems to be the GTA 6 version of a Lime Bike from the rental rack, and then returning the bike to the same spot. Eagle-eyed fans had previously identified bike racks for some sort of rental company (which may well be called \"Lombike\"), so clearly this is another aspect of modern urban life that has found its way into the game. The other two animations show a character, which does resemble protagonist Lucia, clambering down from a truck bed first of all, before the second animation shows her hopping down from the truck roof to the truck bed, and then out to the ground.

TrendForce reports that the NAND flash wafer supply is getting worse, which will directly impact SSD prices, and it already has. How long will it take for those price changes to trickle down to the consumer market? And how long will it take for RAM prices to improve? Today's brought us a few interesting findings, so let's dig in. Starting with the NAND flash prices, TrendForce reports that the demand for NAND flash used in SSDs is strong. To the surprise of no one, that demand is largely fueled by large enterprises (thank you, AI), meaning that's where the manufacturers currently have their focus. The massive demand has led to a short supply, which then led to a price increase in November. The monthly average prices for wafers rose from 20% to 60%. Triple-level cell (TLC) memory was the most impacted. This type of NAND flash stores three bits of data per memory cell. Quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash is also in high demand and short supply. (Image credit: Future) RAM is suffering from the same problems as SSDs, but on a larger scale. Even some of the best Cyber Monday deals are…",

Stxy: Blades of Greed is now set to launch on February 19, 2026 , a relatively brief pause that will give Cyanide time to \"polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking,\" and ensure that Styx's big comeback lives up to expectations. And what are those expectations? For that we'll throw back to Shaun, PC Gamer's number-one Styx guy, who noted that Master of Shadows and the follow-up Shards of Darkness both earned review scores in the upper 70s, \"which sounds about right.\" Styx is also enough of a headliner to be the marquee guy in our recent quiz about videogame goblins , which reminded me (consider this a freebie answer if you haven't taken it yet) that Styx did not emerge into our world fully formed, but was actually a supporting character in the 201…",

    "body": "Windows 11 adoption has been slow for many different reasons, from hardware constraints to people just not wanting to do it. Both valid reasons, I think. But today's File Explorer tests prove that there's more to it than that—Microsoft simply still has some work to do to make Windows 11 as good as it can (or even should) be. Microsoft is currently testing preloading File Explorer in the latest Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available on the Dev and Beta channels. Windows Latest took the new improvement out for a spin, and the results are underwhelming at best. Preloading (or pre-caching) is meant to speed up the load times of File Explorer, which have, so far, been a major downgrade compared to Windows 10. Microsoft is testing loading File Explorer into local memory before you ever need it, so it loads faster when you do. Testing shows that Microsoft has succeeded, but only on paper. (Image credit: Microsoft) Windows Latest ran a bunch of test on a virtual machine limited to 4 GB RAM. Without preloading, launching File Explorer accounted for 32.4 MB of RAM, and enabling the feature nearly doubled RAM usage, bringing it up to 67.4 MB. That's negligible usage, of course, even on …",

It sounds like Houser isn't quite as starry-eyed about the tech as so many other people who continue to occupy corporate C-suites. Asked if AI is going to lead us to the sunlit uplands so many tech 'visionaries' are promising, Houser is unequivocal: \"I personally don't think it will, because I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it—which is really superficial—the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models.

The truth is, we've already had some leaks about the 9850X3D in the last few months, so we have an idea of what to expect, but none of it has come directly from AMD. At least we now know the processor exists, so chances are that the specs are real, but you never know with these leaks. Previously, another Twitter leaker, ch11eddog , said that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D would come with a 120 W TDP, eight cores and 16 threads, 96 MB of L3 cache, and a boost clock speed of 5.6 GHz.

Oh, and with that comes the warning that the new AI features are prone to \"hallucinate\" and \"introduce novel security risks.\" As to the details, Microsoft says security flaws include \"cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.\" In other words, you could download, say, a PDF which contains hidden text instructing your Windows agent to execute nefarious tasks. And it might just carry out those instructions. So, surely Microsoft has some mitigations in place? Up to a point. Firstly and mercifully, these new agentic features are not enabled by default. However, once switched on, they're enabled for all users, all the time. They are at least labelled as \"experimental agentic features\", and a warning is delivered during the setup process.

    "body": "There's been a deep, unfortunate friction between voice actors and videogame studios, recently—the looming spectre of AI hangs large over everything, with some bigwigs salivating at the idea of getting infinite performances out of people without actually paying them. That is, despite the fact that—aside from efforts so far mostly being bland as all hell, and confusing for the actual voice actors —players seem to have a deep appreciation for human performances. This is especially the case with Baldur's Gate 3, where performers like Neil Newbon and Amelia Tyler have gone on to become evangelists for the game. Speaking with our friends over at GamesRadar during the Golden Joysticks, Karlach's VO, Samantha Béart, says they've noticed this discrepancy first hand: \"There's a weird disconnect between, maybe, developers' attitude towards where we fit in the ecosystem—where we're not actually part of the team—versus the players, who very much see us as the forefront. More like film and TV. Logistically, there is somewhat of a point behind that—Charlie Cox, voice of Gustave from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has repeatedly gone on record to say that while he's happy to receive his laurels, h…",

So, it looks like we won't have to wait too long before REPO receives its next batch of content after all, and in my opinion, it's the most exciting one yet. In a YouTube video uploaded to the semiwork channel , developer Pontus shared that they \"acknowledge that a lot of people want new levels and meta progression, such things will be added to the game but it won't be the main focus of the next update.\" Instead, the next update will focus on adding cosmetics for your Semibot to the game, which is a feature a huge number of players have been requesting since its launch in early access. However, cosmetics usually mean microtransactions, but if alarm bells are ringing in your head you can rest assured that semiwork will not be adding any sort of in-game store (aside from the one you already visit in the game) where you can buy new cosmetics and customise your bot. Instead, Pontus was incredibly firm that microtransactions do not hav…",

And as someone who loves getting a long nail manicure, they were causing me to misinput all over the gaff. I tried fight sticks previously but couldn't get with the whole, well, stick part of it.

    "body": "The Persona games sound fascinating. Tactics RPGs about students who fight demonic analogues of small-town problems at night, yet have to balance that with school and social obligations by day? I'd say sign me up, but even the shorter ones take 80+ hours and the longer ones demand well over 100. I tried Metaphor: ReFantazio and gave up in boredom during the second dungeon. They are not games that respect your time. So Demonschool, which seems to basically be a Persona game in all but name and the fact it can be wrapped in under 40 hours, should have been an instant slam-dunk. Our reviewer, Mollie Taylor, liked it well enough , praising the intricacy of its battle system and the wit of its dialogue, but had an important reservation.

The smoking gun is a poster of a yeti relaxing in a hammock , feet dangling over the edge, which clearly has nine toes. After all this time, AI art still struggles with hands and feet. I mean, I can't draw hands and feet either, but at least I know not to draw four toes on one foot and five toes on the other. Other billboards and paintings are being called out for having the smeary look common to a lot of AI art, and an anime-style spray of Marty McFly from Back to the Future looks enough like the Studio Ghibli AI knockoffs that briefly became the internet's favorite thing it's been looked askance at as well.

Luckily for my investigation, it turns out Evelyn Deane was hardly a shrinking violet, though even the briefest of chats with my fellow guests suggests her vanishing is just the gothic spire of this iceberg. There is something rotten in Blake Manor…and I'm sure I'll get to it at some point after I've thoroughly nosed through all of my fellow guests' dirty laundry.

A striking example was recently provided by Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, who revealed that Master Chief's suit design was revised nine times before Bungie settled on his final look. Lehto, who is an alumnus of Ohio's Kent State University, was speaking to Kent State Magazine (via GamesRadar ) about the impact his education had on his future career. During that interview, he chatted about the process Bungie went through to design Master Chief's armour. \"The creation of the Master Chief is something that I went through so many wringers to try to find the right look, the right feel, the right stature for such a character,\" Lehto explained. \"We tried a lot of things.\" Some of these initial designs have made it to the Internet, such as Shi Kai Wang's early concept for Master Chief. Apparently, Bungie felt those early designs were too stylised, and Lehto's later concept borrowed elements from the M1 Abrams tank and the lines of an Apache helicopter.

Titled Sanabi: A Haunted Day , it’s a prequel spinoff in which you play as a different character from the main game. Also, it's completely free. Sanabi: A Haunted Day puts players in the role of Major Song, who has a minor role in the base game. As mentioned, the DLC takes place before the events of Sanabi, with Song investigating a sprawling robots scrapyard which the DLC's Steam page says is plagued by \"strange phenomena\". Alongside the new location, Song has a completely different moveset from the base game's protagonist. While she lacks a grappling hook, she is nonetheless capable of \"agile aerial manoeuvres\" such as an infinitely replenishable mid-air jump.

They were a perfect encapsulation of Warhammer, grim but also a bit silly, heroic but also earthy. Eventually they'd get their own novels, but first they appeared in a compilation of short stories called Trollslayer. Honestly, I don't think the Felix and Gotrek stories worked as well once they were expanded out to novel length. With a few exceptions, almost all of their best adventures were short stories like those collected in Trollslayer, which is why I'm interested in the special edition Games Workshop recently announced .

The new video, titled \"Let's Talk About Canon,\" gets into the weeds as to what counts as canon in a narrative and what doesn't.

Right now, we’re focused on building our MVP gameloop while balancing our modding commitments.\" The duo cite Schedule I in particular, a solo-developed breakout hit, as a major motivator. \"It wasn’t the financial success that inspired us,\" adds Cascavel, \"but the f…",

    "body": "Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter when it released in 1998, what with its top shelf storytelling and novel puzzles. But who needs any of that crap? What if there was a game that turned the clock back just like, a year or two—same alien menace, some of the same innovations, but it plays a hell of a lot more like Quake. No, I'm not talking about Unreal, I'm talking about Half-Life: Element 64 , a fresh mod that released a demo today on Steam . After spending some time with that demo, I can say it's more of an asset flip into an original game with new levels and music than a mod merely tweaking Half-Life's mechanics. There's no train ride, no resonance cascade, nothing waiting for you in the test chamberrr ; it drops you into a level select hub not unlike Quake, HEV suit and all, and from there you'll be blasting away head crabs and vortigaunts in a matter of seconds. The levels, too, are remixed into more straightforward shooting galleries. Hitscanning marines and aliens lurk around every corner, so you're never waiting long between firefights (for which your guns have been provided a pleasantly centered viewmodel). There are secrets to find and an enemy counter trac…",

It might not be a videogame, but mercifully for my attention span, it does show brief gameplay of one in its most recent episode: Tolkien is seen playing none other than extraction shooter tour de force Arc Raiders . Eurogamer highlighted a LinkedIn post that shared the story of how it came to be. Embark's marketing lead, Ashley St. Germain, said of the cameo: \"There’s a lot to be thankful for this year, but I don’t know how I’m going to top this week. On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play Arc Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in season 28’s 'Turkey Trot' episode. Like Tolkien, I guess a lot of us just can’t put down Arc Raiders.\" It's not the first time South Park has referenced popular videogames with straight-up footage.

When I say Arc Raiders , the first things that probably pop into your mind are arcs and raiding. But a huge part of Embark's hit extraction shooter isn't as action-oriented as any of that. A big part of the experience is managing your stash and selling anything that doesn't make the cut—well, if you're good enough at extracting with all of your loot. (Image credit: Embark) But first, you need to know what to sell. Learning which items are worth the most Raider Coins will mean you can buy more parts and weapons when times get tough. And knowing which ones you'll need for crafting and quests is crucial so you don't get stuck later on (it'd be nice if the game told you this, unfortunately it doesn't). Knowing the worth of items will also help you decide what to take back to Speranza with you when you're looting Topside.
