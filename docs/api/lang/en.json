    "body": "U2 &#8216;s Bono was joined by fellow Irish singer Imelda May on Christmas Eve when they took part in a modern holiday tradition. The vocalists hit Grafton Street in Dublin just before the holiday to take part in the 15th annual round of busking to raise funds for local charities. With hundreds of shivering fans gathered around the Gaiety Theatre in the Dublin city center, Bono and May took to a makeshift stage alongside a live band to perform Darlene Love&#8217;s 1963 holiday classic, &#8220;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).&#8221; After making a stop at a microphone that appeared to be on the fritz, Bono and May gathered around the same mic , with the U2 singer taking the first part of the verse and then stepping back as May belted, &#8220;They&#8217;re singing Deck the Halls/ But it&#8217;s not like Christmas at all.&#8221; This year&#8217;s busking raised funds for the Dublin Simon Community , a charity supporting those at risk for homelessness in Ireland in the latest edition of the event that began in 2010 with an impromptu sing-along on Grafton Street. According to NME , Bono and May were joined by Oscar-winning singer-songwriter and event organizer Glen Hansard, as well a…",

The iconic pop superstar went fully method for her holiday video this year, slipping into a lime green Grinch costume on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) for a recitation of the holiday baddie&#8217;s overstuffed schedule. In a clip shared this week , the singer posted up in a chair by a fire pit in the backyard and crooned her indelible cover of Eric Carmen&#8217;s maudlin ballad &#8220;All By Myself,&#8221; which Dion first recorded for her fourth English-language album, 1996&#8217;s Falling Into You . Of course, the sight of famously well-attired Dion goofily crooning the song while wearing a Santa getup over her green, furry costume was enough of a gift. But then Dion made it a notch sillier by cutting to a shot of her holding one of her little pups on her lap while reciting a version of the Grinch&#8217;s lament about his busy schedule from the 2000 Ron Howard-directed, Jim Carrey-starring How the Grinch Stole Christmas . “The nerve of those Whos, inviting me down there on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn’t allow it!” Dion says as the dog wearing antlers like the Grinch&#8217;s pooch, Max, wriggles out o…",

Following her appearance at the 2025 ARIA Awards, presented last month in Sydney, Dean has dominated the ARIA charts for much of December. Indeed, she claims the double for a third consecutive cycle in these final stages of the year, and this week bags one of four new releases on the ARIA Singles Chart, as “I’ve Seen It” drops in at No. 50. Two of those fresh cuts belong to Liverpool, England rapper EsDeeKid, who converts a hot presence on TikTok and wild Internet speculation into multiple, improving chart positions. “4 Raws” impacts the ARIA Top 50 Singles Chart for the first time, up 54-28, as does “Century,” up 60-45, while “Phantom” featuring Rico Ace makes its move, lifting 31-21 (all through Lizzy Records/ADA).

There, at a party, the 18-year-old Peso met his 20-year old cousin Tito for the first time. Both were aspiring musicians, but Peso already came with a sound and a style: he sang the corridos tumbados that were beginning to make the rounds with the likes of Natanael Cano and Junior H, about lifestyle and drugs, a far cry from the “corridos de hombres” about heroes and anti-heroes that most Mexicans had grown up with. Even then, his nasal, piercing vocals struck a chord. And, more than anything, says Tito, so did his energy. “I made music as a hobby then,&#8221; says Tito today. “And from the moment he arrived, I said, come here. I&#8217;ll write, you sing.&#8221; It was the beginning of a musical partnership and a close friendship that first propelled Peso to super-stardom (with Tito co-writing many of his biggest hits) and more recently, Tito.

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",
