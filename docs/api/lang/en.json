According to Arrowhead founder Johan Pilestedt, such a mode is actively in the works for Helldivers 2. \"Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode—it changes the game fundamentally!' Pilestedt casually wrote in response to an X user pitching his idea for an endless mode (as spotted by GamesRadar ), as if he didn't just spill the beans on what would be the biggest shakeup to Helldivers 2 since launch. Well that's exciting. While most of us haven't taken to social media to tell Arrowhead about it, I imagine lots of fans have also wondered what an endless mode in Helldivers 2 would look like. I reckon anything resembling Gears of Wars' old Horde modes or Halo Firefight would fit nicely, though based on Pilestedt's comparison to roguelites, we can assume this prototype includes modifiers or power-ups. What if in the roguelite mode, you had to buy stratagems instead of equipping a set of five? What if you could call down entire defensive structures from your mothership?

This matched my own experience with the game back then. The enticing promise of a full and faithful digital recreation of D&D's 3.5 ruleset—and a chance to throw magic missiles somewhere other than the Sword Coast thanks to the game's use of the Greyhawk setting—was brought down by frustrating technical issues and odd design choices. I was never quite sure if I was doing something wrong or because the game had got its d20s in a twist again, so I quickly decided to stop playing rather than spend hours scouring forums in the hope of finding the right workaround. Which is why SNEG's re-release of this famously temperamental game, out now on Steam , is so interesting.

This week, during a panel at Spain's Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 (via Eurogamer ), John Romero confirmed that Romero Games has avoided closure and is continuing work on an overhauled shooter project. You can watch Romero discussing the status of his studio in the video embedded below. \"We survived the cancellation of our huge game,\" Romero said, earning applause from the audience.

And, after playing an albeit too brief demo, it definitely reminded me why I love these creatures so much. There isn't much of an introduction to the demo, let alone the characters. So, if you're not super familiar with the world of Moomins you might feel a little bit out of your depth, as you're immediately introduced to Moomintroll and the gaggle of Fillyjonks' children. However, you don't really need to know the ins and outs of each character, which is one of the reasons these games are so enjoyable. You also get a feel of the characters through the dialogue alone. As Moomintroll is approached by Fillyjonks' children in the snow, they seem incredibly panicked and are quick to ask for your help.

Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn , comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a \"co-op party platformer\" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims \"leadership\"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches.

So it's definitely newsworthy that Asus has just launched what appears to be its first-ever 5K gaming monitor. That's right, 77% more pixels for your GPU to cope with. The display in question is the snappily-titled ROG Strix 5K XG27JCG , and as the name suggests, its key feature is the 5120 x 2880 IPS panel. Coming in at 27 inches in size, though, that's a lot of pixels being packed in there. Specifically, it's 218 pixels per inch, which is an absurdly high density. Pro creators never really care that much about having a display with high refresh rates, but gamers do. Fortunately, despite its immense pixel density, the ROG Strix 5K still manages to top out at 180 Hz, with FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatible VRR support, all with a grey-to-grey response time of 0.3 milliseconds. Sounds fab, right? Well, a resolution of 5120 x 2880 is 77% more pixels than 4K, so you can well imagine how hard it would be for any GPU to run a game at this level.

    "body": "20 years after the original launched as the world's first gaming mouse, at least according to its maker, Razer is back with a rebooted Boomslang . At a glance, the new mouse looks like much the same ambidextrous gaming rodent as the millennial classic. But, predictably, there's plenty of new technology on offer. Speaking of offerings, Razer is only offering 1,337—uh, huh—units of the Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition. So, if you want one, well, you know what to do. Putting the FOMO aside for a moment, the original Boomslang offered 2,000 DPI mechanical ball tracking (actually, the original-original Boomslang was 1,000 DPI and predates 2005, more on which in a moment) that was ground-breaking at the time. The new model ups that to fully 45,000 DPI, then throws in 8,000 Hz polling and optical switches with claimed 100 million click lifespan for good measure. Oh, and where the OG Boomslang was wired, this reboot is inevitably wireless and comes with what Razer describes as a dock with \"next-gen\" charging. Physically, the basic ambidextrous design looks to have been carried over largely untouched. But visible stitching on the buttons betray that it's been, \"enhanced with PU leather-w…",

It's not a new model, as the China-based company actually launched its TF3-360SCB back in July, but I was browsing through some Japanese PC hardware news , which brought it to my attention. With Asetek's 20-year patent on AIO coolers expiring earlier this year, the market has seen a flood of new models, all at vastly reduced prices. That's been good for us PC builders. However, for cooling companies, it's become increasingly harder to make something that stands out from the crowd. Enter stage left, the Jonsbo TF3-360SCB , which (to quote the great Marge Simpson) I think is just neat. You get the obligatory LCD screen in the pump head/CPU mount, but also three extra displays along the edge of the fan block that mounts to the radiator.

Even before the full release, the beta also had a rough launch with no text chat or FOV slider, and issues with its download.

Well, where things get somewhat interesting is this relatively unassuming observation in the Wired story: “Bitcoin mining created the blueprint for the AI compute boom and the modern data center,” Wired quotes Meltem Demirors, general partner at the VC firm Crucible Capital, saying. “They have found that th…",

With the AMD Adrenalin 25.12.1 driver releasing today, you too can get on the new FSR bandwagon. So long as you have an RDNA 4 card, that is. Better known as FSR 'Redstone', the work done here essentially brings AMD on par with Nvidia and Intel, in terms of applying AI to upscaling, frame generation, and other rendering technologies. However, it's worth pointing out now that AMD still doesn't have multi-frame generation, so it's not quite at the same level. It's also a little too early to tell whether the new FSR frame generation is as good as DLSS MFG or XeSS-MFG in terms of image quality, and that's because it only works on a relatively small number of games. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: AMD) Something else that I need to get out of the way is AMD's bizarre decision to drop any numbering with FSR. For example, FSR 4 was announced in February and brought AI-powered upscaling to games on RDNA 4 graphics cards. That's now simply called AMD FSR Upscaling. But that's al…",

It's a substantial roll call. But Windows remains under threat, most obviously from Valve's Steam OS, but also arguably from its own crumminess. Microsoft groups the gaming enhancements it delivered in 2025 into three broad groups: handheld innovation, Windows on Arm, and DirectX. Kicking off with handheld gaming, Microsoft says key improvements include the full screen experience (FSE) that debuted on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally . That's designed to enable a more consistent, \"console-like\" experience while also minimising background tasks for better frame rates. Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) also debuted on the Xbox Ally. ASD delivers precompiled shaders at install time, eliminating most of the wait time and stuttering when you launch a game for the first time. Microsoft claims the \"numbers speak for themselves\" when it comes to ASD. \"In Avowed, first-run load time dropped by over 80% and Call of Duty: Black O…",

This was a UI bug—turns out that with the \"move\" widget on a lot of homes, there was a hidden vertical arrow that could still be clicked on. You could also fiddle around with moving another object vertically to trick the game into thinking this was the case (you can see YouTuber DiscordianKitty doing so here).

But it's also flaky as all hell with strange bugs and, despite the whole reason for its existence being that it's supposedly a versatile 3-in-1 device, it resolutely fails to convince in pretty much any of those formats. Like the older, Meteor Lake-powered OneXPlayer X1 , this is a device designed to operate as a standard (although very thick) PC tablet, with a laptop-esque form thanks to its magnetically attaching keyboard and touchpad, and as a handheld gaming PC with a pair of clip-on controllers. And, inevitably, that desire for flexibility hobbles each option in different ways. I was genuinely hoping that things would be different this time around, but it feels like OneXPlayer has not learned the lessons from the original device and is determined to make the same mistakes.

But I'm happy/terrified to confirm that her bark really is as bad as her bite with this one. Aside from appearing as a brawl tank, Rogue's main ability allows her to steal other enemy heroes' powers. These are all the powers we know she can steal so far: Thor's awakening state Doctor Strange's shield Groot's walls Emma Frost's diamond state One of Phoenix's attacks Iron Fist's healing Psylocke's invisibility Invisible Woman's projectile punches Loki's healing lamps It's a hell of a roster of powers to choose from, but unfortunately, you won't be able to use all of these in one match, well, not unless the enemy team keeps changing heroes to include one of these characters. As before, Rogue can use a stolen power; she has to steal it. It doesn't look like the process of stealing powers ac…",

Fortunately, after countless trial-and-error crafts and plenty of mistakes, I've finally gotten the hang of it and feel ready to share a little forging wisdom.

So it seems only fitting that the fan translators who did such a marvelous job with that game would wind up getting to do the same for another underappreciated cozy gem—only this time, with official backing. 1999's Milano's Odd Job Collection, out on Steam today , is the first 'legit' project from the fan translators at Hilltop Works, who teamed up with publisher XSeed and emulation-porting house Implicit Conversions to release the game in English for the first time. I think the background of how Milano ended up finally being released in English is maybe even more interesting than the game itself, given how rare it is for fan translations to get the official seal of approval.

According to an Embark X post , the Cold Snap update arrives Tuesday, December 16. According to Embark's official Arc Raiders roadmap , the Cold Snap update brings a new map condition called snowfall, the \"Flickering Flames\" event, a new raider deck (basically a battle pass), and new quests. Players have speculated about what exactly the snowfall map condition will entail (is it just the same maps but with snow?), but a teaser image shared by Embark today of a collapsed raider in the snow suggests the extreme temperatures will carry consequences. It looks like players might have to limit their exposure to the elements to avoid freezing to death, or perhaps toss an incendiary grenade to warm up. That's the most obvious way to make heat a factor of survival, but I wonder if Embark would go even further—what if wearing warmer clothes, like a fur jacket, increased your heat resistance? That'd instantly plunge Arc Raiders into the realm of pay-to-win cosmetics, so consider it unlikely, but it would be an interesting wrinkle. 16.12.25 pic.twitter.com/UxQH0nAP1L D…",

Before that, it made a reboot of Modern Warfare 3 in 2023 just a year after its reboot of Modern Warfare 2 (2022). The repetition has created a strong sense of fatigue among parts of the player base, which Activision cited (indirectly) as a factor of today's decision. \"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games.

Executive producer Jonathan Nolan has already confirmed season three will begin shooting next summer, which just shows you the kind of faith Amazon has in this as a long-term project, and when PCG spoke to some of Bethesda's most senior Fallout team Nolan was a name that popped up frequently. PCG's Ted Litchfield recently spoke to a number of Bethesda worthies, including design director Emil Pagliarulo, and a common theme among all of them was admiration for the quality of the show. In most circumstances you'd put this down to company people saying the right thing about a company product, but the thing is that the Fallout TV show's first season was great . I ended up watching it with my partner, who isn't exactly into sprawling brown RPGs, and by the end she was enraptured by the depth and weirdness of this take on the post-apocalypse. \"It's really fascinating that the show is part of our lore,\" says Pagliarulo. \"It's connected to the games, it's by having the show set, I think it's nine years after Fa…",

According to the Battlefield Comms X account , players are reporting buggy menus, incorrect ticket counts in Conquest (this has since been corrected), and nonfunctional tier skipping in the Winter Offensive unlock path. But worst of all is an annoying stutter that I've encountered on PC. Every minute or two, my client will lock up for a handful of frames, a problem I haven't had once previously in 80+ hours of play. Battlefield Studios has acknowledged this new bug as well, and for now, one possible workaround is to shut down your Steam friends list (assuming that's the platform you're playing on). A workaround that seems to help some players on Steam is to go offline in the friends menu.

As noticed by MP1st , a new European trademark filing for something called Divinity was made today by a German law firm that's previously filed trademark applications for other Larian games.

Each day, customers will rock up and require your skills when it comes to their rundown electronics, and it's your job to fix them. This will involve taking them apart, cleaning them up, diagnosing and mending the issue before giving them back. These repairs look incredibly in-depth as well. It's not just a case of giving everything a good dust after you've taken its screws out; you really have to get into every nook and cranny.

Once you've successfully tracked and captured your insect of choice, you'll get to pop it into a jar with another bug and watch what is essentially a first date play out.

While exploring, you'll meet a cast of unique characters to befriend, but unlike what we're used to in a lot of other games, it won't be as straightforward as going up and introducing yourself. This is where the game's premise of finding new ways to communicate with other characters rather than just relying on dialogue comes in. From what we've seen in the trailer, this includes using communication cards dictating actions like \"play\" and \"dance\", or developing bonds by completing tasks for new friends such as finding a missing charm.

While that change proved to be a great success in Path of Exile's sequel, it hasn't gone quite so smoothly for Riot, with initial fears that it would unbalance the game now mostly giving way to the opposite problem: players complaining that the controls suck to use. When Riot announced the change in a blog post in August, it framed it as a way to make the game more approachable. “We’ve seen that for new players, WASD is the most familiar control scheme for PC games today, and let’s be real, a lot of us instinctively put our fingers there when coming back to League after playing something else,” the developer said. “By offering WASD as an alternate control scheme, we believe League will feel more intuitive to some players who come from other games.” Soon after the announcement, players were already spiraling into doomsday scenario…",
