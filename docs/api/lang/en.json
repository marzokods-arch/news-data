It was rumored that Samsung would adopt Qi2 for the Galaxy S25 series. However, that didn’t happen. Instead of putting Qi2 into its phones, Samsung ended up making Qi2 cases for the line. While the Galaxy S25 missed out on Qi2 support, rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 may be the series that finally gets the feature. A recently leaked accessory seems to back this possibility.

Of the 14 categories, Sunshiner is by far the most common type, while Philosopher and Trailblazer are the rarest at 0.1%. The spread reflects how many people use YouTube for lighter content, with only a tiny slice focusing on niche or deep-dive viewing. YouTube’s first full Recap seems to be going down well. In our recent poll, nearly 72% of readers said they liked the feature , which is a comfortable win for something brand new in a season already packed with roundups. Recap pulls together your year on YouTube across 12 cards, including the summarizing Personality Card. Now, YouTube has shared how common each personality actually is. According to the company’s blog , these personalities are meant to be a simple way of grouping different viewing patterns. They’re not meant to be deep insights into who you are, just a light shorthand for the sort of content you spend most of your time with.

The film also pulls in global moments like major cricket matches and a reference to the first American pope.

The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists. It ends up feeling a bit like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap , just with more real-world news footage and less personalization.",

A more advanced follow-up to the surprisingly popular Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses (), the new glasses have a monocular display (meaning there’s one screen in one of the lenses), a Neural Band wrist strap that lets you control what you see by performing air gestures, and, most importantly, a price: $799. While expensive, this kept Meta at the forefront of the burgeoning XR revolution by making it the first major tech player to have a retail-ready set of smart glasses that seem to bring us the future Google Glass promised us over 10 years ago. Unfortunately for Meta, there are three major problems with the new Ray-Bans.

As a tool for reading with limited annotation capabilities, the Kindle lies squarely in Amazon’s walled garden. Over the years, Amazon has given it a limited additions like the ability to look up definitions using a dictionary that is useful but painfully isolated. Sure, there are features like X-Ray for deeper story insights, but those only work if you have bought a book from Amazon’s storefront.

According to anecdotal reports from the usual corners of the internet, one unexpected bonus appears to be improved graphics performance for the Pixel 10. Google hasn’t officially mentioned a new GPU driver that Pixel 10 owners have been waiting for, but that doesn’t mean that minor improvements or optimizations aren’t tucked away inside. To find out, I grabbed my Pixel 10 Pro XL running the November 2025 patch, ran our usual test suite, and then updated to the QPR2 December 2025 update and tested again.",

Whether I’m craving pizza, need to calculate compound interest, find a tailor for a shirt alteration, or check the current Premier League scores, I can accomplish all of these tasks with an app of some description. So naturally, when it comes to customizing my phone’s wallpaper, I’ll use a dedicated wallpaper app . According to a recent reader poll , though, not every Android Authority reader agrees. Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours. With this in mind, I’ve made a point to go a step further with my phone customization and create my own wallpapers to bring a real personal touch to my device. For those who want to do the same, here are some ways I go about this.",

With the Pixel 10 series shipping out of the box with built-in Qi2 and Qi2 25W , we thought things would finally be standardized and that we wouldn’t have to think about which charger we’re using with which phone. Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers.

That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Payouts should start this spring, with affected users eligible for at least $2 via Venmo or PayPal. Payouts will mostly be automatic, but users who can’t receive automatic payments have other options. A couple of years ago, Google settled a lawsuit brought by US states that accused the company of holding an illegal monopoly on Android app distribution, using its position to overcharge users for apps and in-app purchases. Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out.

The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update.

Users can now define detailed personas, tones, rules, and context without fighting the character limit. For anyone who’s been using NotebookLM to digest massive PDFs or brainstorm via the Audio Overview feature , you probably ran into a big limitation: the chat customization field. Until now, if you wanted to tell Google’s research tool how to talk to you, you were boxed into a meager 500 characters. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Pixel phones can now function as USB webcams for the Nintendo Switch 2’s GameChat feature. Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly. This allows Pixel owners to join video calls on the console without needing to purchase or carry a separate webcam. One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

The narrow waterway separating Peninsular Malaysia from the Indonesian island of Sumatra sits so close to the equator that the Coriolis effect is usually too weak to allow storms to rotate enough to organize into cyclones. But on November 25, 2025, meteorologists watched as a tropical depression intensified into Cyclone Senyar—just the second documented case of a tropical cyclone forming in the strait. Hemmed in by land on both sides, Senyar made landfall in Sumatra later that day as it made a U-turn and headed east toward Malaysia. As the slow-moving storm passed over Sumatra’s mountainous terrain, it dropped nearly 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in many areas, according to satellite-based estimates from NASA’s Global Precipitation Me…",
