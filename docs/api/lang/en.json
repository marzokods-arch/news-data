Previous handhelds have faced significant delays in crowdfunding, so this is a welcome change. The premium 4.2-inch, 4:3 handheld has a powerful G3x Gen 2 SoC and starts at $319 for the month of February, with a free gift pack. AYANEO has done the unthinkable. The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

To be sure, tackling songs by one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time is not for the faint of heart and add on the nerves of performing in front of said vocalist and credit is due for any of the artists who even felt up to the task. In general, the performers fell into three buckets: Belters, devotees and innovators. Jennifer Hudson , who opened the show with a medley of Carey&#8217;s hits, including “Vision of Love” and “Make It Happen,” obviously fell in the belter category, as one of the few vocalists with the mighty prowess to power through Carey’s hits. It was an audacious beginning that surely did nothing to quell any butterflies subsequent performers may have had.

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",

The device runs Android 14 and supports stylus input, an optional keyboard, and 4G LTE connectivity. Pre-orders are live now, with pricing starting at $699 and shipping expected mid-February. As color E-Ink tablets edge closer to traditional tablets, Bigme has officially announced the B10. The generously sized device is positioned as a productivity-first tablet for reading, writing, and, with an optional keyboard, light work. The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools. The device also supports varied text input, with stylus support for handwriting and sketching, plus an optional magnetic keyboard case. The latter nudges the B10 toward lightweight laptop territory.",

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Log files from the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest Samsung may finally support Android’s Linux Terminal feature after skipping it on the S25 Ultra. The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

Apps are going missing from Google’s Nest Hub smart displays . A Reddit post showing a relatively empty app drawer on a Nest Hub led us to check our own devices — and sure enough, my Nest Hub Max is also missing shortcuts to apps it once had, though I’m not sure when they disappeared. User Head_Worldliness5101 posted on the Google Home subreddit yesterday, saying that the apps previously accessible from the app drawer on their second-generation Nest Hub smart display are now mostly gone, leaving only Sling, Stories, and YouTube TV. As they tell it, they’ve had their Nest Hub for about a week, and they had access to apps from the app drawer as recently as the day before their post.",

This mission will pave the way for Artemis III, which will be the first time we’ve sent humans to the lunar surface since the final Apollo mission, Apollo 17, in 1972. So this month, look up to the Moon shining bright in the night sky and there might be somebody looking back down at you. Can you spot Orion the Hunter in the night sky? NASA/JPL-Caltech You might be able to see the line of three stars that make up Orion’s Be…",

One big focus could be better hardware support for modern codecs. There are maybe three kinds of Android TV users out there.

Then we’ve got the budget crowd who just wants to find the most affordable streaming solution around. But then, there are the power users.

I loved the idea of a phone that only took up half of my pocket, and I didn’t really care what companies did with their book-style foldables. Then, Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Fold 7 , and it quickly won me over. Sure, it was probably a little too expensive, but the hardware felt brilliant, and I finally figured out how to use a device like this as a regular phone, which kind of justified the whole experience. Now, though, I think Samsung has jumped the shark. Its Galaxy Z TriFold is as ambitious as its price is eye-watering, and I don’t see how anyone can justify buying one at launch. Here’s why I’d rather exercise a boatload of caution.",

Maybe you got started swapping out your old lights for some fun new voice-controlled bulbs with a full spectrum of RGB colors. Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings. Nuki has already been a great option there for users in Europe with its Smart Lock Ultra , and now it’s bringing its Smart Lock to the US. I tested it out for a few months to see how it holds up.",

I own a few pieces of connected kit; my robot vacuum cleaner seems harmless enough, and I’ve even hesitantly installed a smart thermostat to cut my energy bill and keep my house warmer. But that’s it. One line I’ve certainly never dared to cross is installing a smart lock on my door. I can’t convince myself of the benefits over a good old-fashioned key, especially given some pretty reasonable concerns about service outages or somehow locking myself out of my home (though I have managed that with a regular key, to be fair).

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

Last September, Google TV’s homescreen received an updated navigation bar along with a shortcut to launching Gemini. While that update is still rolling out to users, Google appears to be testing a new set of changes to the navigation bar, making it easier to browse content across different apps. According to Reddit user Jodath79 (via 9to5Google ), the Google TV interface is getting two new tabs on the top navigation bar. These new tabs, placed between the Live and Apps tabs, are designed to search for “Free” and “Paid” content across apps installed on the Google TV.",

Wi-Fi doesn’t usually make headlines unless something breaks, but this week it got a boost that could shape the next wave of connected gadgets. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has voted to expand how unlicensed devices can use the 6 GHz band, a move that could make future Wi-Fi gear faster and more flexible than what we have today. As Fierce Network reports, the FCC’s decision creates a new category of unlicensed devices called geofenced variable power (GVP).

Samsung usually leans heavily on trade-ins, especially for its high-end devices. The device is officially going on sale tomorrow, so it looks like you’ll have to fork out the full asking price. At $2,899 plus tax , the Galaxy Z TriFold is already asking a lot. If you were eyeing Samsung’s three-panel foldable and telling yourself you’d claw some of that money back by trading in your current device, you might want to brace yourself. Early signs suggest that the option may not be on the table. As 9to5Google spotted, Samsung briefly put the Galaxy Z TriFold up for sale on its US website earlier today, ahead of its official launch tomorrow. The phone wasn’t available to buy for long, but the listing was revealing. While buyers could see pricing, bundles, and add-ons, the usual trade-in option was conspicuously absent.",

A complaint that earned it countless poor reviews on Google Play, causing great confusion among users and spawning several sketchy forks. That change is the removal of support for .3ds files, which is by far the most common ROM file type for Nintendo 3DS games. The team claimed this was to distance the project from its predecessor’s dubious roots in piracy, but in practice, all you needed to do was change the file extension from .3ds to .cci, and it still worked, provided the files were not encrypted.",

The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

    "body": "Credit: Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has released a new update for the Galaxy Watch 4, fixing issues brought by the One UI 8 upgrade last month. Multiple users on Reddit have confirmed that issues with their Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic have resolved. The update also brings the January 2026 security update. The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

Apple dominated the top four spots globally with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 lineups. Demand for affordable 4G devices remains surprisingly high, as seen in the success of the Galaxy A06 4G, which sold more than any Galaxy S25 series flagship. With all the marketing hype around Android flagships , you’d think that some of them would go on to be best sellers for the year. Take, for instance, the Galaxy S25 series , which launched globally in January 2025, giving it a strong position to emerge as a global top-seller in 2025. As it turns out, the most popular Galaxy phone of 2025 isn’t the Galaxy S25 — it’s not even a flagship at all. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the last gaming phones on the market (and our top pick for the best gaming phone ), but now it’s set to get a cheaper, more pocketable sibling. The REDMAGIC 11 Air is a slightly slimmed-down version of the 11 Pro, but not by much. The company writes that it’s “12% thinner and 10% lighter” than its larger sibling, with the same 6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel. It’s still roughly as thick as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra at 8mm, but the flat back means there’s no camera bump to get in your way while you game.",

Instead, it will focus on its Phone 4a series and audio products. Pei says the decision is backed by the intensifying competition to acquire smartphone components. The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026. This could be a shocker for Nothing fans, as it seemingly was for the staff member speaking with Pei on the talk show.
