The Outer Worlds 2, despite getting a solid thumbs up by resident RPG sicko Ted Litchfield in his review , is no exception. See, the $100 premium edition of the game gives you access to Obsidian's latest five whole days early. Also, to be fair, a few bonuses that are technically worth the price—two future DLCs, access to the artbook and soundtrack, and a couple of bundles with armours and weapons in them. Standard stuff. Oh, and also the privilege of Obsidian sticking its tongue out at you and going ner-ner. See, in The Outer Worlds 2, you can pick up optional \"Flaws\". These are typically curse/kiss debuffs with a slight upside, forcing you to play around them—and they're typically triggered by certain in-game events.

If I could scratch away with reckless abandon without thinking of the gambling of it all you bet I would. Unfortunately, I can't do that in real life, but I can do it in the ridiculously morish clicker game Scritchy Scratchy . (Image credit: Lunch Money Games) I admit I was quite disappointed when I first booted up the game. I had expected to go right into the scratchers, but instead I'm forced to pick up a spaghetti-coated plate and scrub it clean for a few pennies. Scratchcard money doesn't make itself, I suppose. Once I'd washed a few dishes—and broken some, a light introduction to Scritchy Scratchy's luck system—I was finally bestowed my first scratchcard.

I am a man on a mission—a mission to roleplay. My craving for quality RPGs never subsides. I finish one, and then I'm off on a new quest, to find another. But like so many RPG protagonists before me, I'm also cursed. Specifically, I live with the curse of having played too many great RPGs, which means that even a perfectly fine one just doesn't cut the mustard. For a week now, I have been trying to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 . I tried to shed all my expectations and just go with the flow, to immerse myself in the off-kilter sci-fi universe that Obsidian has created. But folks, I simply cannot get into it. And this time I can't blame its proximity to Disco Elysium. (Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment) See, when the first game came out, I made the mistake of hopping in right after I'd just finished Disco Elysium .

Eyes up.Plates on.#REDSEC arrives tomorrow at 8:00 PT / 15:00 UTC 🔴🔔 set reminder: https://t.co/xuRd1LETVr pic.twitter.com/Lpi7sufuay October 27, 2025 The announcement follows numerous leaks of the battle royale mode's rollout date, as well as its title, Battlefield: Redsec. Notable as well is that the battle royale mode, like it's Call of Duty counterpart Warzone, is free to play. No further details, like how the free-to-play battle royale mode will intersect with the definitely not-free-to-play Battlefield 6, have been revealed at this point, and the teaser on X—four soldiers, seemingly of different classes, walking away from a downed airliner in a burning residential neighborhood, doesn't tell us much either. That suggests to me that this is EA scrambling in a rapid r…",

    "body": "When PC hardware companies all jump onto a bandwagon, it eventually becomes almost impossible to stand out from the crowd, because everyone's doing the same thing. Thermaltake must have realised this because its latest AIO liquid CPU cooler has taken cooler screens to a new level, but it's also given it a whole bunch of neat extra features. The cooler in question is the Thermaltake Minecube 360 Ultra ARGB Sync (via Hermita Akiba on X ), and the name alone gives you all the clues you need to guess what the AIO cooler looks like, assuming you've not taken a gander at the images yet. Where most vendors have been content to add a single LCD screen to their AIO blocks, Thermaltake has added four individual displays to the Minecube: one facing straight up, and the other three forming a 'wrap-around' effect, starting on the rear IO side of the motherboard before finishing at the DRAM slots side. Admittedly, having a screen facing the rear IO panel doesn't make much sense, because you're barely going to see it in an average PC case. Anyway, using Thermaltake's software, you can apply individual animated GIFs to each panel or have them display hardware info, such as temperatures and clock …",

If you haven't played a Jurassic World Evolution game before, it is exactly what it says on the tin: a park-building simulator where you raise, research, and sell tickets to see dinosaurs, but it doesn't dare to step outside of that boundary. You'll create buildings, connect them to paths and power them with electricity before inviting guests, alongside sending out research teams to discover new species you'll eventually get to hatch and raise. The cycle continues. This time around, there are a few notable quality-of-life improvements, such as automating pesky maintenance tasks like repairing fences after a storm or caring for any sick dinosaurs, which makes park life a lot easier.

A chore. The side quests? Formulaic.

Well, great news if you happen to be me, then: an enterprising modder by the name of Eralyne has created Bloodlines 2's first fast-travel mod, letting you zip all about Seattle at the touch of a few hotkeys. It's called, well, Fast Travel , and it works by assigning various locations around Seattle to particular keys (or combinations thereof) on your keyboard. The locations you can travel to, currently, are: Aurora Pawn (Niko the Banu Haqim's hangout) The Dutchman (Silky the Brujah's club) Your haven The police station Weaver Tower (where you'll find Prince Ryong and co) The conservatory Glacier Hotel (Lou's gaff) The Hole in the Wall (the bar Katsumi spends her night in) Which is pretty much anywhere you'd ever need to go…",

Your options are A) a licensed therapist, or B) the good folk at LarpVenture, a Polish live-action roleplay (LARP, you see) studio currently putting together Frostpunk: The Last Recon , an upcoming, 40-50 player roleplay event happening in Poland this February. No, you haven't misunderstood, this is an event whose main draw is collecting a load of people to spend three days eking out a hard-scrabble existence in a real-life version of Frostpunk's very cold apocalypse. The event costs between €415 and €490, depending on how early you get in, and participants are given prewritten characters with full character sheets to act out. \"You will chop wood to feed the stove, scavenge for supplies, cook real food over open flames—and then decide who eats,\" says the blurb. \"You’ll drag injured teammates through volcanic fumes, light oil lamps in the ruins, argue policy in freezing shelters, and comfort the dying while your own fingers go numb.\" So it's a lot like Butlin's .

You can't quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.\" As the article notes, Layden's tenure oversaw a trio of Sony's singleplayer knockouts, and part of why he left the company was due to their live-service pivot, which he quips were \"not my skillset.\" Layden oversaw God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.

Compared to the start of 2025, when GPUs were in short supply and prices for many models bordered on the ludicrous, the final quarter of 2025 is a much nicer affair. 👉 The best early Black Friday PC gaming deals right here 👈 Entry-level, budget, and most mainstream graphics cards are generally priced at or below their MSRP, despite import tariffs. It's only the likes of the Radeon RX 9070 XT and GeForce RTX 5090 that remain overpriced. We're expecting new graphics cards from Nvidia in the new year, when it launches the Super variants of its RTX 50-series cards. That means we could see big discounts on RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 cards, as retailers try to clear inventory. We could also see something new from AMD and Intel, but there hasn't been much gossip about these so far. When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 kicks off Friday, 28 November 2028 and runs for three days over the whole weekend.

Mid-range buyers will be well-served by RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti machines, whereas if you've got the cash to splash, even RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 gaming PCs will be dropping in price. Oh, and don't rule out AMD GPUs, either. The RX 9060 XT is an excellent budget gaming graphics card, while the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are very quick mid-range performers.

X account ModernWarzone (who exposed that very bad bong gun in Black Ops 6 last year ) writes : \"A new content drop for Battlefield 6 that is NOT Season 1 codenamed 'Granite' with release date of October 28th has been datamined from the EA App.\" The screenshot, shared here by user YourAkhiNeo , states that \"Granite\" has a \"playablestartdate\" of October 28, 2025.

That's where design documents come in—living, comprehensive treatises that outline all a game's systems and design goals to be referenced by those working on the game—at least, for some. Johan Andersson, lead on Europa Universalis 5, said in an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens that the practice can be too rigid and restraining. For Paradox Tinto, good design comes with a bit of democracy. \"Design documents stifle creativity and it reduces people's ownership and empowerment,\" Andersson said. \"You create better games by talking with your team … tell the person some broad outlines, like 'we want this,' 'it should function like this,' a few samples, and let them make the detailed decisions.

Kato and her commenters speak Japanese, and I didn't feel like I'd get anything worthwhile out of YouTube's auto-translation feature (which presumably draws from already-garbled auto-generated captions), but there's a universal language of horror at work here that makes the stream very easy to follow regardless.

    "body": "Back in May Auroch Digital found a delightful way to announce the existence of Boltgun 2, teasing it at the end of a free typing game . And while it's nice to know Boltgun 2 is in development, it's nicer to know a bit about what it will actually contain. The latest trailer does just that, by informing us that Boltgun 2 will let us choose a second playable character. That character being Nyra Veyrath, a Celestian of the Sisters of Battle, to be specific. She wields a bolt pistol/power sword combo, switching to a meltagun or flamer when the enemies of the Imperium need a good superheating, and has some good mobility, with a slide move I couldn't imagine the bulky space marine Malum Caedo pulling off. As well as letting us choose between two protagonists, Boltgun 2 will have a branching campaign, with different decisions leading you through different levels. It'll also have more biomes than the first game, including a jungle swamp and a hive city to fight through. Looks like there's an ice world too? I just hope I don't get lost in the levels as often as I did in the original. Boltgun 2 will be out in 2026, and available on Steam . I'm sure the internet will be completely normal abou…",

Today on Oct. 26, that number hit a screaming high of over 300,000 simultaneous players, according to SteamDB . When PC Gamer news writer Lincoln Carpenter gave the game a spin, he conceded he thought the game was an elaborate bit at first. It won him over, though, as he said his impressions: \"Under its deceptive meme game veneer, Escape From Duckov is an excellent topdown shooter that smartly repackages the extraction shooter in a satisfying singleplayer format.\" Singleplayer extraction shooter might sound like a bit of an oxymoron—the genre is all about evading other players to escape with your life and loot—but Duckov is stuffed with all sorts of quests and a base to kit out with upgrades, essentially squeezing the genre into the framework of a roguelite RPG. There's also fishing , love it or hate it . If it's true that Team Soda's angle was to inject a little virality into their game with the satirical title and cutesy animals, then b…",

Europa Universalis 2, for instance, was conceived under brutal time constraints. Andersson explained, \"We came up with a bunch of ideas for what we should be doing. I think we, in two or three meetings, wrote down, like, three pages of ideas, and it's 'Okay, we need to get this game out quickly, and it needs to be done so it's sold in the US market before Christmas, because we need the money [or] else we cannot pay people.'\" That didn't curb the team's ambitions, mind you. Players had already tinkered with EU1—wherein you selected from a small batch of scenarios, each with a designated playable nation—to make any country accessible from the get. The mod maker behind that feature, named Henrik Fåhraeus, was hired as content designer for the sequel, which aimed to have every country playable in the base game; today, Fåhraeus is Paradox's chief creative officer. \"So, that's a good hire.

In an interview with PC Gamer news writer Joshua Wolens , Andersson recalled one of the studio's earliest games: \"If you want to laugh, Google Valhalla Chronicles. We had the best comment ever on that one: 'bugs, many and diverse, some more interesting than the gameplay.'\" It's not a looker. But as Andersson explained, the team was \"doing multiple games at the same time\" and its take on a Baldur's Gate-inspired RPG \"did not turn out great. \"We did a lot of games with a small team of like five, six people for the first, like 10 years,\" he said. \"We became Paradox in 1999 and Paradox Interactive in 2005.

Or where we never got to hear a real monk chanting absolute bars over Metaphor: ReFantazio's orchestral battle theme? A timeline where we never get to experience the delicate piano of Kingdom Hearts' Dearly Beloved washing over us when booting up the game? I certainly can't, which is why I maintain that JRPG music is some of the best in the biz. It kind of has to be, really. Not only will they probably be some of the longest videogames you ever play—hello to my triple-digit Persona 5 Royal playtime—but they'll also probably take you through every feeling you could ever experience.

From the first moment you step foot on Paradise Island, you'll start discovering all sorts of strange murder contraptions, from a sniper rifle that fires sneaky explosive bolts you detonate when you reload, to a pistol that infects enemies with a contagious disease they can spread. The strangest weapon by far that I've discovered in my travels through Arcadia, though, is a sword that turns combat into a rhythm game. Yes, you read that correctly—if you don't slash and slice to the old timey beat, you won't gain its bonus. This sword might seem like a bit of a meme at first, but when fully powered up, I'm convinced it might be the best melee weapon in the game. The Spectrum Dance Saber, as it's called, is quite hard to get. You'll first have to complete an elaborate collectible quest to unlock it, and even then it'll set you back 16,500 bits , making it by far the most expensive weapon I've found in the game. Even after unscrupulously looting my way across the first few regions, this still put a serious dent in my hoard of bits.

We won't find out what Darktide's second class DLC will be until it's revealed on November 11, but Fatshark did confirm the game's story will continue to be expanded. \"I wouldn't say it necessarily always will be attached to a new class or anything like that,\" said design director Victor Magnuson, \"but each new piece of the game will add to the overarching story of the game.\" Magnuson explained that it's been difficult to \"beat narrative\" into Darktide. Two players might come to a mission having had very different experiences leading up to it, and having different amounts of patience for a game slowing down to drop narrative on them. \"Our approach is to just add it piece by piece,\" Magnuson said, \"and build the narrative as little puzzle pieces that slowly fall together and then you see…",

In 2010, before League of Legends and Dota 2 had become the esports institutions they are now, there was Heroes of Newerth. Before it shut down in 2022 , it was a relic of a time when MOBAs hadn't really proved their staying power yet; and now, somehow, it's back. First announced nine months ago , Heroes of Newerth: Reborn is a relaunch-slash-remaster of the defunct MOBA. A trailer dropped Wednesday announcing a free open beta starting on Nov. 11, and it certainly looks like HoN. While League of Legends was a fully original game with its own heroes and items, HoN was much closer to DotA (albeit with a trashier sense of humor). In May 2010, Dota was still just an old Warcraft 3 mod, so HoN had its niche among players who didn't like League's snappier, skill shot-oriented action. All this makes the re-release sort of a headscratcher for any outside of Newerth's niche fanbase. If you long to play Dota, it's one of the biggest games on Steam—a platform Reborn is completely forgoing in favor of Juvio. If you're wonde…",

Still, the strangest helmet I've come across in my travels through outer space is by far A New Point of View Mk 2. This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest.
