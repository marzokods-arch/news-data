The Better Value Plan has impressive perks that actually compare favorably with Experience More, for around the same price. While T-Mobile is still arguably the best value in the postpaid wireless market , the gap between it and its rivals has narrowed over the last few years as the Un-Carrier has increasingly mirrored competitors on pricing and overall value. Likely in an effort to push back against that perception, T-Mobile has announced a new value-focused plan it claims AT&amp;T and Verizon can’t compete with.

For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

We’ve since seen 200MP sensors used on Android phones by OPPO, realme, HONOR, and vivo. What about Apple, though? Well, it sounds like we’re in for a long wait. According to an investor note by Morgan Stanley (spotted via AppleInsider ), Apple will only adopt 200MP cameras on the iPhone 21 series in 2028.

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

The move targets long, forced ads and also bans delays when closing static ads. While ads fund creators on the platform, the regulation aims to rein in practices that many users feel are seriously hurting the viewing experience. It’s safe to say that unskippable ads on YouTube are only getting longer and becoming an extreme nuisance. Of course, you can always pay for YouTube Premium to eliminate ads or use alternatives like the Morphe app , but the truth is that those options aren’t for everyone. No one can really stop YouTube from running more ads on the platform or increasing the length of unskippable commercials, which currently go up to 30 seconds. However, one country is now fighting back, not with popular opinion, but actual laws.",

Both models support cutting-edge standards, including Dolby Vision Gaming, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, and Filmmaker Mode. They feature MediaTek’s MT9655 chip and run Google TV based on Android TV 14. Kickstarter launches in early February at $2,199 (Max) and $1,999 (Pro), with retail availability starting in April for $4,499 and $3,499, respectively. Projectors are fast emerging as a popular alternative to having a giant TV in the living room , and it makes sense, too. Instead of having a TV imposing and commanding attention all the time, a projector moves out of the way when the job is done. At CES 2026 , we’ve seen numerous new projectors from companies such as Samsung , Epson , and XGIMI . If you’re still on the hunt for a performance-oriented projector, the new Aetherion projector from AWOL Vision could be worth checking out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",

DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",

Google has freshly released the Android Security Bulletin for January 2026, listing a critical vulnerability that will be addressed in security updates. The list isn’t quite as long as the December 2025 bulletin , and that is because Google recently moved to publicly disclose a large chunk of security issues in Android on a quarterly basis rather than every month . In fact, the only critical vulnerability listed in the bulletin relates to the Dolby Digital Plus Codec , which is used for playing audio files on Android.

Whenever someone needs to go to bat for the small, pocket-friendly form factor, you can almost guarantee that it’ll be me.

I think it offers the best mix of hardware and software on a flip phone, especially its cover screen. Now, there’s a new Razr that I should be throwing my support behind. Motorola has just announced its first book-style foldable, the Razr Fold, and I know I should be excited, but I’m not sure I can be — at least not yet. I still have many questions about how the Razr Fold will compete with the likes of the Galaxy Z Fold and Pixel Pro Fold, and I’m concerned it may not find a large enough audience.",

Leaks in December suggested that Lenovo was preparing a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2 . It was presented as a possible alternative to the Windows model, targeting players who sought a more console-like experience on a handheld. It appears the rumors were true, as Lenovo has now officially announced that device at CES 2026. Unveiling the device, Lenovo appears to have formally titled it the Legion Go, powered by SteamOS (8.8”, 2). While the name is a bit clunky, it appears to simply describe the same second-generation Legion Go hardware, featuring an 8.8-inch display, this time running Valve’s operating system instead of Windows.",

Since beginning the project, Google released the source code for nearly every new version of Android for mobile devices, typically doing so within days of rolling out the corresponding update to its own Pixel mobile devices. Starting this year, however, Google is making a major change to its release schedule for Android source code drops: AOSP sources will only be released twice a year. Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4. The reason is to ensure platform stability for the Android ecosystem and better align with Android’s trunk-stable development model .

Color E-Ink isn’t just for E-Ink tablets anymore, and wall art is one of the more logical places it’s showing up. The tech offers the flexibility of digital art without the glow, noise, or constant power draw of a traditional screen. After launching its first consumer-friendly color ePaper art poster in 2025, InkPoster returns to CES 2026 with two new A1-size frames that scale the idea up in a big way.
