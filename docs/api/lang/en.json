Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit.

    "body": "Between high-profile collaborations, long-awaited retro returns, and thoughtful reinterpretations of classic silhouettes, 2025 has been an outstanding year for sneakers, as the culture felt both reflective and forward-moving. Some of the most legendary shoes in history made returns this year: the Air Jordan 1 High ’85 “Bred” came back in true OG form, the Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 finally reentered the conversation after only 72 pairs released back in 2005. Nike brought back one of its most iconic releases with the Air Foamposite One “Galaxy.” We also saw the return of the coveted “big bubble” on the Nike Air Max 95, as nostalgia reigned supreme in 2025. The year also marked a refreshing change for sneaker enthusiasts, though. For once, many highly anticipated releases didn’t immediately sell out. In 2025, you didn’t have to wake up at 10 a.m. ET and sit in an online queue just to miss out. In many cases, you could log on an hour later and still secure a pair, a rare but welcome moment of accessibility in modern sneaker culture. Currently, you can even buy Jordan 1’s, Jordan 3’s, and Jordan 4’s below retail, whether from retail stores or resale platforms. At the same time, new col…",

    "body": "NASA/Zena Cardman In this Oct. 20, 2025, photo, tiny ball bearings surround a larger central bearing during the Fluid Particles experiment, conducted inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) aboard the International Space Station’s Destiny laboratory module . A bulk container installed in the MSG, filled with viscous fluid and embedded particles, is subjected to oscillating frequencies to observe how the particles cluster and form larger structures in microgravity. Insights from this research may advance fire suppression, lunar dust mitigation, and plant growth in space. On Earth, the findings could inform our understanding of pollen dispersion, algae blooms, plastic pollution, and sea salt transport during storms. In addition to uncovering potential benefits on Earth, research done aboard the space station helps inform long-duration missions like Artemis and future human expeditions to Mars.

The Orion spacecraft was stacked atop the SLS in October 2025. Set to launch in early 2026, the Artemis II test flight will be NASA’s first mission with crew under Artemis. Astronauts on their first flight aboard Orion will confirm all the spacecraft’s systems operate as designed with crew aboard in the actual environment of deep space. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars – for the benefit of all.
