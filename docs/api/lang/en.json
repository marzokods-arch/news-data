It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way.",

If you’ve grown accustomed to using the three-button navigation bar on a Samsung phone , then you might have a hard time switching to a Google phone . That’s because Samsung uses a different layout for its version of the three-button navigation bar. Instead of putting the back button on the left like on stock Android, Samsung puts the back button on the right. While Samsung does let you flip the order of these buttons to match stock Android’s layout, the opposite isn’t true. Stock Android doesn’t let you flip these buttons, so people switching from Samsung phones have to either retrain their muscle memory on the new button layout or switch to gesture navigation.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working on a new setting that gives Pixel users more control over the Always-on Display. This new option will automatically power down the display when no user activity is detected, helping save battery life. The feature isn’t live yet, and it’s unclear exactly how Android will determine when the phone is inactive. At the cost of some battery life, your phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance. While most Android phones have an AOD, it doesn’t behave the same way on every device. Some phones let you schedule the AOD to benefit from its glanceable information without unnecessarily draining the battery. Pixel phones , however, offer no such controls — the AOD is either on or off during the day. Fortunately, Google is working on a new setting that will soon give Pixel users more control over this feature.

    "body": "TL;DR A future Android update will add a native flashlight brightness slider to the Quick Settings on Pixel phones. The latest Android Canary release introduces a new visual design for this slider that resembles an actual flashlight. This feature is not expected to launch in a stable release until the Android 16 QPR3 update next March. Most Android phones have rear LEDs that can be used as a flashlight, but not all of them let you natively control the brightness. On Pixel phones , for instance, adjusting the flashlight brightness requires a third-party app. This is a hassle, and many users aren’t even aware such apps exist, leaving them unable to change their flashlight’s intensity. A future Android release will finally let you adjust your Pixel phone’s flashlight strength from Quick Settings . Instead of a simple toggle, the Flashlight tile is being updated to be expandable, revealing a slider to control the flashlight’s intensity. While this slider had a barebones design in the 2508 Android Canary release , Google is now giving it a more striking visual update.",

The Palma 2 Pro adds 5G in a pocket-sized design. After launching the P6 Pro series in China earlier this month, BOOX has now brought its high-end counterpart to a global audience. The new Palma 2 Pro brings the same blend of color E Ink and 5G connectivity to the US and Europe, launching alongside the larger Note Air5 C tablet. Both devices run Android 15 and continue BOOX’s effort to combine the comfort of paper with the flexibility of a smart device. We got an early look at the Palma 2 Pro during IFA 2025 in Berlin , where it already hinted at many of the same upgrades seen in the P6 Pro. The 6.13-inch handheld swaps the usual black-and-white E Ink display for a Kaleido 3 color panel, which delivers 300 ppi for monochrome content and 150 ppi for color. It also features 5G support via a hybrid SIM and microSD slot, marking a first for the Palma lineup. Powered by Android 15 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, it keeps the textured, water-repellent design that made the earlier Palma 2 such a hit.",

The rest of the camera system consists of a 50MP main camera (1/1.56-inch), a 50MP ultrawide shooter, and a 32MP selfie camera. In a neat touch, you can swap out the rear camera housings. So, if you fancy a circular housing, a square bump, or a robot-like housing, you can screw those on. Realme also said it will offer schematics so you can 3D-print your own housings.",

    "summary": "Unlike other Android phones, the Pixel 10 supports GPU-accelerated rendering for Linux apps in Android 16 QPR2.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding GPU acceleration for graphical Linux apps to Android’s Terminal app, but the feature is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10. This feature relies on Gfxstream, a library that forwards graphics API calls from the guest Linux virtual machine to the host Android device’s GPU for accelerated rendering. Though the feature is live for Pixel 10 users in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3, it’s still buggy and doesn’t yet offer the near-native performance expected. Back in March, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app to Android, which uses virtualization to run full-fledged Linux programs on Android devices. While the initial release only supported command-line apps, Google is addressing that limitation in the upcoming Android 16 QPR2 update. Even though Android 16 QPR2 will add support for graphical desktop Linux apps , they will run poorly on most Android devices. This is because the Linux Terminal app currently relies on a software-based renderer called Lavapipe. Lavapipe uses the device’s CPU for complex calculations and rasterization (the process of converting vector graphics into pixels) — tasks that the device’s GPU can perform much more quickly and efficiently.",

This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard.

    "body": "The Galaxy S20 FE marked the debut of the Fan Edition for Samsung, and it was a sensation upon its release back in 2020. It was a genuine flagship-tier Android phone that didn’t break the bank. I’ve long felt like subsequent releases have failed to live up to that initial device, as the Galaxy maker chose penny-pinching conservatism over a truly exciting product. Samsung has recently released the Galaxy S25 FE (), and I’ve spent just over two weeks with it. The good news is that the company is stepping up its game with a couple of long-overdue upgrades. But is this enough to make the phone worth buying? Let’s dive into our Galaxy S25 FE review.",

Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps.
