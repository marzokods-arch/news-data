While it starts at just $1.99/month for 100GB storage, things get extremely messy and unfair if you subscribe to anything including and above the $9.99/month 2TB Premium plan. What started as a simple way to get extra cloud storage and some benefits has morphed into a Frankenstein bundle of AI perks no one asked for, leaving users like me wondering what we’re actually paying for. The reality is that Google is pushing its AI agenda on Google One subscribers, and it’s starting to really bother me.",

Users who accept the free line will have to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and note that promotional limitations will apply to that free line. Reddit users suggest verifying eligibility carefully through support channels and checking billing statements before activating new SIMs. T-Mobile does have some great plans and offers , but the carrier also hiked prices on its legacy plans earlier in the year. To soften the blow, the company rolled out a targeted promotion giving some users a free voice line . If you missed out on the offer back then, T-Mobile is now offering some users a free line, so it’s worth checking if you are eligible. There are also some catches that you should keep in mind before accepting the free line. Several Reddit users ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) report receiving an email or text from T-Mobile informing them that they are eligible to add a free line to their account.",

The Find X9’s square camera bump is strikingly similar to the leaked OnePlus 15 design. Find X9 is also set to arrive in titanium-inspired colorways that have also leaked for the OnePlus 15. The OnePlus 15 is coming soon, and its updated design is already making rounds on the internet. Multiple rumors in the past have hinted at the redesigned camera bump on the upcoming flagship. And we recently came across purported hands-on images of the OnePlus 15 , which highlight the changes on the back. Although the authenticity of these images could not be ascertained, another teaser from earlier today suggests this change might be legitimate after all. The teaser does not come from OnePlus, but its parent company OPPO, which is set to unveil its flagship Find X9 series on October 16. That is just one day after the reveal of ColosOS 16, which has been confirmed to drive the OnePlus 15 in China. OPPO has been teasing the Find X9 series over the last couple of weeks.

The Irishman was impressed that the youngster, in such a stressful situation, could take an Adele song and “make it your own. It was literally like you’d written the thing.” And hitting those bigger notes, he did it “with ease,” the former One Direction singer remarked. That was all part of Horan’s slick pitch.

By going on sale Friday (Sept. 19), Coachella&#8217;s organizer, Goldenvoice, gave itself seven months to sell out of the 250,000 tickets it puts on sale for the two-weekend festival.

If you own a OnePlus Watch or OnePlus earbuds, you might have seen a confusing email recently. It came from HeyTap, the Oppo-linked company that develops and supports the OHealth and HeyMelody apps. The email said US account services are shutting down on September 28. That naturally raised a few eyebrows. These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next? Some Watch owners on Reddit worried they’d be cut off from their health metrics. Others assumed there would be a plan, and this would have little impact on the apps themselves.",

This build shows tree, grass, and ragweed pollen levels on color-coded leaf icons, linking to Weather.com for details. The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

Now, there’s a new issue that should be a little concerning for those who don’t put their phone in a case.

Gemini appears to be working on a new mode that would infer when you’re talking about your screen, and then automatically analyze it. Google would also offer settings to disable this functionality, so Gemini would need explicit permission to look at your screen. How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool.

Best Buy will provide SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and face-to-face support for customers who are interested in Visible but turned off by its current online-only model.

TCL also plans to upgrade the existing QM8K with Gemini support. Gemini has already made some big strides to replace Assistant across Google’s ecosystem — plus just inject a fresh dose of AI assistance into corners that didn’t even have any yet. Right now we’re not just looking forward to the Gemini-fication of Google Home , but Gemini also coming to Google TV . Back in May, we learned that TCL would lead that charge as the first manufacturer to deliver a Gemini-equipped screen, and just the other week, we saw TCL introduce the QM9K , its first Gemini model. Now we’re finally getting the all-important details about how you can take one of these TVs home. TCL gets sales of the QM9K started in the US today, where you’ll be able to find the set available in four different sizes at Best Buy.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

APV will enable lossless video recording with minimal degradation in quality and color. Samsung is also said to include the option to add LUTs to LOG videos directly from the Gallery app. Apple’s iPhone has traditionally been acclaimed as the leader in video recording. The Pro models have especially spearheaded their way with video features, such as ProRes, which allow professional-grade recording and post-production. However, Samsung may now be gearing up to challenge that dominance by introducing new video recording formats and potentially dethroning the iPhone 17 Pro . Samsung is expected to enable cinematic-grade video recording on the upcoming Galaxy S26 series. According to a report by SammyGuru , Samsung is planning to add support for the APV (Advanced Professional Video) codec , which enables recording near-lossless video quality with minimal pixelation, even without significantly increasing the video size .",

After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place.

But there’s one minor change that’s probably gone under the radar, and that has made my personal Photos experience so much better. I’m talking about the improved functionality when adding photos to albums.

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

But with the iPhone Air, Apple has gone in the opposite direction. The phone is built impossibly slim, almost delicate, like a product designed as much as the set piece of a fashion-forward futuristic movie as for the Apple Store. It reminds me of the first-generation iPod nano. I scoffed at it when it launched. Then got my hands on it. It quickly became my favorite EDC kit.

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how the industry is shifting and whether an online-only future may be on the horizon.",

For now, a useful workaround is to navigate to your book via the three dot menu. If you’ve recently tried to open a sideloaded book on your Kindle and hit a wall, you’re not alone. Starting this week, users across Reddit’s r/kindle community began reporting a sudden “Invalid ASIN” error message. The alert claims the selected title is not valid for Digital purchase on the Kindle, even when the book was loaded via USB or email rather than bought through Amazon’s storefront. Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected. Oddly enough, if you navigate by tapping the three dots, then Go to, then select a chapter, you can crack open affected books. Toggling Airplane Mode can also help you escape a redirect loop to the Kindle Store, though it hasn’t worked for everyone.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A new report allegedly shows off Samsung’s next One UI 8.5 update, which is expected to launch with the Galaxy S26 series early nexty year. In the images, One UI 8.5 features a slight redesign to the Settings app. iOS 26-inspired changes include a bottom search bar and a floating back button. Samsung has barely gotten One UI 8 out the door for its current-year flagships, and we’re already getting treated to information on One UI 8.5, the company’s next expected update for Galaxy phones and tablets. One UI 8.5 development is already underway, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise, as we expect the new release to ship with the upcoming Galaxy S26 series early next year. Now, Sammyguru has gotten access to images of a Galaxy S21 Plus running a modified, alleged One UI 8.5 build from the Galaxy S25 Ultra.",

    "body": "Barely a year ago, I wrote that the Pixel 9 Pro XL was everything I hoped for out of a Google flagship and then some. It felt like everything I’d always wanted from a Pixel came together with everything Google was already doing right, and the finished product was even better than the sum of its well-polished parts. I spent several months throughout the year dipping back into the most premium Pixel whenever I got the chance between testing other phones, and I felt like it just kept improving with each passing update. Eventually, though, I started looking to the future. I wondered how Google could follow its best launch ever and worried it might push too far and lose the magic. And then I got the Pixel 10 Pro XL in my hands, and my fears (mostly) melted away. Here’s how this maxed-out flagship earned a place in my small-phone-loving heart.",

But does one of the smallest projectors I’ve tested do enough of the projector essentials? I tested for a few weeks to find out.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority Google is constantly pushing the boundaries of AI in its Phone app, and the new Voice Translate feature on the Pixel 10 series is one of its most ambitious attempts yet. The idea is to break down language barriers in real time and make phone conversations smoother when you and the person on the other end speak completely different languages. What’s even more fascinating is that Voice Translate attempts to mimic the voice of the speakers in order to make conversations sound more natural. I decided to test out this sorcery for myself, translating calls between English and Hindi (my mother tongue), and came away with a mix of awe, amusement, and a few headaches.",

After using it daily for years, I grew frustrated with its file management system — or rather, its lack thereof. The inability to sort documents into folders within the app left me with a long, unorganized list of files, hindering my productivity. Eventually, I decided to explore other options. I’ve tested a bunch of Google Docs alternatives, and in this post, I’ll recommend four of the best ones I’ve found. While the first one is my top recommendation, the others are also excellent choices depending on your specific needs.",
