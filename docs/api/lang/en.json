    "body": "TL;DR Google has published new promo videos for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro. The Pixel 10 clip is classic Google, criticizing Apple fans for their “vanilla” choices. The Pixel 10 Pro spot, on the other hand, is far more ethereal, and is more about making an impression. Google does a lot of things very, very well, but you don’t have to be an iPhone fanboy to recognize that Apple is just running circles around the company when it comes to promotional efforts. Even at their best, Pixel ads tend to come across as quite odd, as we saw with the recent series of stop-motion “Best Phones Forever” spots surrounding the Pixel 10 ‘s launch. Now Google’s starting off this week with a couple new videos and they are just as weird as we’ve come to expect. The most stylistic, and arguably the more interesting ad here focuses on the Pixel 10 Pro and is at least ostensibly about the handset’s design:",

    "body": "Background The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) has reviewed flight, ground test, and published data on ultraviolet-induced degradation of silicone based thermal control coatings. Analysis has shown, for at least one silicone coating, that bake-out plays an important role in ultraviolet (UV) degradation, indicating that UV interaction with paint volatiles, and not the structural material, is the primary source of coating discoloration. Discussion Spacecraft temperature is primarily determined by the absorptivity and emissivity of the vehicle’s coating. Absorptivity is the fraction of the sun’s irradiance that is absorbed, and emissivity determines the amount of infrared power that is emitted. The combination of these properties, along with additional heat from internal sources and other external radiation sources, determines the spacecraft’s thermal environment. Choosing an appropriate coating, referred to as a thermal control coating, is key to keeping the vehicle within a desired temperature range. However, these coatings can degrade, (i.e., darken), in low earth orbit (LEO), primarily due to solar UV exposure, complicating the choice of coating. Zinc-oxide (ZnO) scatte…",

Challenger Artists, co-founded by Marek and Wiedel in late 2024, is built around the kind of artist-first ethos both developed in the Kansas City scene. Wiedel, who has spent nearly a decade as a Mammoth talent buyer, and Marek, who previously managed artists through Backbeat Management, joined forces after Marek left her former firm and brought breakout indie act The Wrecks with her. Soon after, the pair struck an agreement with Mammoth that allowed them to launch a management arm within the larger company’s infrastructure.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A new leak suggests Samsung One UI 8.5 will bring a “completely customizable” control panel. While the example screenshots could demonstrate the feature better, they show potential for unprecedented customization. If all modules are movable and removable, this could be Samsung’s biggest control panel redesign in years. We’ve already found a bunch of interesting new features in Samsung One UI 8.5, but we’re not the only ones who have been tinkering with the builds. A leaker on X claims the update will make the Samsung control panel “completely customizable,” and has shared some images as proof. According to tipster @theonecid , who shared three screenshots of the feature, One UI 8.5 seems to go beyond the usual row shuffling already available in Samsung’s interface. It looks as if the whole panel is much more modular, with a vast scope to rearrange it and remove parts that you don’t want to see.",

    "body": "“Golden” from KPop Demon Hunters leads the Billboard Hot 100 for the sixth week , the longest run for a film song since “See You Again” from Furious 7 topped the chart for 12 weeks a decade ago. So you might think “Golden” is a cinch to land an Oscar nomination for best original song. It certainly could be nominated, but its chart success provides no guarantee. Of the 14 film songs that have topped the Hot 100 since 2000, just four were nominated for best original song at the Oscars. Even “See You Again” failed to land a nomination. The soothing tone of the song helped fans mourn the loss of Paul Walker, one of the stars of the franchise, who had died in a 2013 car crash. Given the magnitude of the hit, and the song’s touching backstory, you might reasonably have expected it to be nominated, but voters sometimes surprise. Netflix’s official Oscar entry on “Golden” lists five songwriters: EJAE , Mark Sonnenblick, 24, IDO, and TEDDY. Oscar rules stipulate that if there are more than four songwriters on a song, they must sign a form saying they agree to receive one “group statuette” for all of them to somehow share, should they win.

Sometimes it even feels almost as easy as texting, and you don’t even need to fully open an email to get all you need from it, and the info in your notification is more than enough. If that sounds like your experience, you’re going to be a big fan of Gmail’s new notification option. It’s been a couple months now, but this past summer we started getting reports from users about a new option showing up in Gmail notifications, no longer just letting you delete an email or start crafting a reply to it, but now letting you directly mark it as read , right from the notification. While we saw multiple Gmail users getting access, this was also far from generally available, and it looked like Google was still testing the feature out.",

Xiaomi has explicitly confirmed that users will no longer need proprietary chargers and cables for the fastest charging speeds.

USB Power Delivery promised to be the holy grail of smartphone charging, but several Android OEMs chose to abandon the standard in favor of their own proprietary solutions for fast charging. Many Android flagships claim charging speeds as high as 100W-120W, but the fine print is that you need the proprietary charger to get those speeds.

If you like the idea of browsing the Play Store for new apps, but often get overwhelmed with how to start searching, these updates could actually be pretty helpful. We’ll start with the updates to curated spaces. Spaces live at the top of the Apps tab in the Play Store (next to For You, Top charts, etc.) and are curated collections of apps around a specific topic.

But that’s not the only way anymore. Android now offers a few more options both when installing and uninstalling apps. Since most of the apps I use are permanent fixtures on my phone, the only time I really need to install or uninstall an app is when I’m trying something new. Most people probably fall in the same category: You’ve got your preferred music streaming service, social media apps, productivity tools, and more; everything is already chosen. So when you need to try out something new, I recommend you use these tricks instead.",

We spotted an under-development feature that could utilize AI to generate titles for notes in Google Keep. Google Keep already lets you generate lists using text prompts. Google has been bullish on enriching existing features across its apps with AI. Simple text-based functionality consumes the least compute, which is why we’re seeing small additions creep up in several apps — in addition to Gboard’s writing tools . While messaging apps have largely been the focus for text generation or correction with AI, Google is also testing functions across other apps, and Google Keep is one of them. Now, Google is testing another AI-assisted feature in Keep notes to help craft better titles. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

OnePlus says US accounts are moving to a new platform, with “historical contributions” set to be preserved. Support staff also indicated OHealth and OnePlus account services should not be affected. If you own a OnePlus Watch or OnePlus earbuds, you might have seen a confusing email recently. It came from HeyTap, the Oppo-linked company that develops and supports the OHealth and HeyMelody apps. The email said US account services are shutting down on September 28. That naturally raised a few eyebrows. These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next? Some Watch owners on Reddit worried they’d be cut off from their health metrics. Others assumed there would be a plan, and this would have little impact on the apps themselves.",

The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

When you choose to be a caseless user, you have to be extra cautious with how you handle your smartphone. Or else you risk your phone getting dinged up.

Customers can now sign up at Best Buy locations, with SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and basic support provided. Plans and features remain the same as online, though some in-person services may involve Geek Squad fees. As T-Mobile announces a new CEO and its commitment to a digital-first experience (meaning more focus online and less in-store), Verizon’s digital-first brand Visible is taking a different approach . To be clear, Visible will not be opening its own stores or abandoning its online-first model, but customers can now sign up for service directly at Best Buy locations nationwide. Best Buy will provide SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and face-to-face support for customers who are interested in Visible but turned off by its current online-only model. Ultimately, this move is about giving consumers more ways to sign up, though the plans and features remain the same as those available online.",

The redesign uses animations in the style of AI Mode and removes recent searches. The test appears to be server-side, so only select users will see it so far. Google seems to be testing a refresh of the way voice search looks inside the Google app , including the Shazam-like song search section. To the surprise of no one, the redesign makes it feel more in line with the company’s AI features. As spotted by Telegram user @shishirverm, the change has started showing up in version 16.36.40.sa.arm64 beta of the Google app. Right now, tapping the microphone icon in the Google app or the home screen widget brings up a screen that says “listening…” and some recent searches plus search suggestions underneath. If you press the “Search for a song” button, you get another page with an animation and a small prompt to play, sing, or hum a song.",

With the launch only a week away, the company has now shared a new detail about its upcoming audio product. Similar to Nothing’s Headphone 1 , the CMF Headphone Pro will have an assortment of differently-shaped buttons and controls. Among those controls is a feature that looks a lot like a volume slider.

TCL also plans to upgrade the existing QM8K with Gemini support. Gemini has already made some big strides to replace Assistant across Google’s ecosystem — plus just inject a fresh dose of AI assistance into corners that didn’t even have any yet. Right now we’re not just looking forward to the Gemini-fication of Google Home , but Gemini also coming to Google TV . Back in May, we learned that TCL would lead that charge as the first manufacturer to deliver a Gemini-equipped screen, and just the other week, we saw TCL introduce the QM9K , its first Gemini model. Now we’re finally getting the all-important details about how you can take one of these TVs home. TCL gets sales of the QM9K started in the US today, where you’ll be able to find the set available in four different sizes at Best Buy.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

APV will enable lossless video recording with minimal degradation in quality and color. Samsung is also said to include the option to add LUTs to LOG videos directly from the Gallery app. Apple’s iPhone has traditionally been acclaimed as the leader in video recording. The Pro models have especially spearheaded their way with video features, such as ProRes, which allow professional-grade recording and post-production. However, Samsung may now be gearing up to challenge that dominance by introducing new video recording formats and potentially dethroning the iPhone 17 Pro . Samsung is expected to enable cinematic-grade video recording on the upcoming Galaxy S26 series. According to a report by SammyGuru , Samsung is planning to add support for the APV (Advanced Professional Video) codec , which enables recording near-lossless video quality with minimal pixelation, even without significantly increasing the video size .",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

A minimalist phone that serves my essential needs and nothing more. As a millennial with Gen Z tendencies, it’s pretty clear that I’m the audience for this phone. Every September, iPhones get bigger, heavier, and more stuffed with specs. It’s the progression of tech, and by and large, people value a phone by its hardware-to-dollar quotient. But with the iPhone Air, Apple has gone in the opposite direction. The phone is built impossibly slim, almost delicate, like a product designed as much as the set piece of a fashion-forward futuristic movie as for the Apple Store. It reminds me of the first-generation iPod nano. I scoffed at it when it launched. Then got my hands on it. It quickly became my favorite EDC kit.

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how the industry is shifting and whether an online-only future may be on the horizon.",

NASA/JPL-Caltech Written by Melissa Rice, Professor of Planetary Science at Western Washington University Perseverance accomplished something unusual this week: abrading two dramatically different rocks within the span of a few days. While exploring the Vernodden area along Jezero crater’s rim, the rover has been studying what might be “megablocks,” a variety of ancient crustal materials with clues to Mars’ early geological history. The target “Peachflya,” abraded on sol 1618, revealed clasts of different mineral compositions. This could mean the rock is a breccia formed from fragments of even older materials that were broken up, transpo…",

    "body": "All the pieces are stacking up – literally – for NASA’s first crewed mission of the Artemis program coming in 2026. Teams are finishing integration of the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis II test flight with its launch abort system on Sept. 17 inside the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 44-foot-tall tower-like abort structure would swiftly carry the four-person crew inside Orion to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency during launch or ascent atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Over the next few weeks, teams will complete remaining closeout activities before moving the spacecraft to its final stop before the launch pad: the agency’s Vehicle Assembly Building. There it will be added to the top of the rocket, before the finished stack is rolled out to the launch pad on its way to the Moon. The abort system is comprised of three solid rocket motors :&nbsp;the jettison, attitude, and abort motors. In the case of an emergency, these motors work together to propel the astronauts inside Orion’s crew module to safety: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle; the attitude control motor steers and orients th…",

    "body": "NASA/JPL-Caltech In this infrared photograph taken on June 2, 2025, the Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Table Mountain Facility near Wrightwood, California, beams its eight-laser beacon to the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) flight laser transceiver aboard NASA’s Psyche spacecraft. At the time, when Psyche was about 143 million miles (230 million kilometers) from Earth. Managed by JPL, DSOC successfully demonstrated that data encoded in laser photons could be reliably transmitted, received, and then decoded after traveling millions of miles from Earth out to Mars distances. Nearly two years after launching aboard the agency’s Psyche mission in 2023, the demonstration completed its 65th and final “pass” on Sept. 2, 2025, sending a laser signal to Psyche and receiving the return signal from 218 million miles (350 million kilometers) away.
