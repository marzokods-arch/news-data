It's an impressive achievement for Gearbox's $70 co-op shooter, but if it puts Borderlands 4 somewhere in the stratosphere, then Hollow Knight: Silksong must be mingling with the aurora borealis, having hit 587,150 concurrent Steam players on the Saturday after it launched. Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been. The rest of the story in this case includes the detail that Silksong is much cheaper than Borderlands 4—$20 vs $70—which helps explain why it was able to attract a greater number of Steam player…",

I found one of the early weapon upgrades and kind of stuck with that for the next 30 hours. It got the job done, but it was nowhere close to the power of YouTuber Syrobe's \"easy mode\" build where you have an endless supply of powerful tools. Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

    "body": "September might be packed with game releases, but Silksong set an early watermark for the month by clearing out the release calendar of competitors, claiming a place in all-time peak player count rankings , and—lest we forget—setting Steam entirely on fire . As the dust settles, we're now getting our first estimates for just how many copies Silksong has sold. In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

    "body": "I'm making my way slowly to the end of Act One in Silksong, and one of my mainstays has been Thread Storm, a powerful AOE multihit ability that can be acquired fairly early on. But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level. NickTew's character is level 50 and his level 35 knife works because the stat is the same no matter what. Vex has a passive skill called Bloodletter that gives your guns a chance to apply a bleed damage over time effect.

You might look at a $500 Secretlab and think it's a bit hard on the wallet, but that's just peanuts when it comes to the sort of ergo-inspired gear you might find arrayed around the swankiest of offices. 'Proper' office furniture can easily cost double that of the best gaming chair , and sometimes even more than that. Right here I have my bottom parked on a Humanscale Freedom Headrest task chair, and it's a serious grown up chair. And it's also $2000. I guess, in the sort of office where you've spent at least that much on your pink iMac and the same again on some beautifully engineered 'executive toy', that sort of outlay to support your spine and sooth your buttocks makes sense. But can we justify that as a PC gamer? Honestly, this PC gamer cannot. But this isn't a chair that was really designed for me, though it certainly feels like it from the way it cradles my body as I'm sat at my desk right now. I've been using this chair for months, and have been loving it. But this is a chair for serious people who are serious about ergonomics, and serious enough to want to spend the same amount of money on a chair a…",

And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

Plus, if you've made it to any of the main bosses or final encounters in any of the vaults, you'll know just how much you'll have to use these in combat, especially the grapple. The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it? Head into the accessibility settings and disable ' grapple view tilt '.

In the case of Battlefield 2042 , the last instalment in the series, Battlefield Studios has been able to look at it and go, 'Yeah, we won't do that again' when it comes to laying the groundwork for Battlefield 6 . Battlefield 2042 isn't looked back on very fondly by players. Its futuristic setting robbed players of the usual gritty and grounded setting of previous Battlefield games, and it took chances on new ideas that didn't land well. One such being 128-player matches. (Image credit: EA) \"We thought larger player numbers would work—it just didn't catch on,\" design director Shashank Uchil tells Edge magazine (via GamesRadar ). \"It's like when a band tries a new sound. Because we like it, but then players don't—and in the end, we are subservient to the players, we do what the players want.\" 128-player matches in Battlefield 2042 proved to be a tad too much for players to get to grips with . Battlefield is known for pure chaos, but such a significant bump up from the usual 64-player matches was just too much to keep track of. \"Look, we try stuff,\" Uchil says. Sometimes it works, sometimes it do…",

On the one hand, I dropped 800 or so quid on it and it carried on chugging for a decade. On the other hand, it really kept me on my toes throughout the back half of its lifespan. Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop .

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more. For example, it adds more than 30 animations that were included in console versions but not on PC, which will make you look much cooler while you're shooting a minigun or running with the rocket launcher equipped.

This early Silksong champion is CrankyTemplar on YouTube, who also appears to have done a lot of Hollow Knight 1 challenge content previously. CrankyTemplar uploaded a first no-hit compilation of Silksong's early bosses the day it came out, releasing subsequent addendums over the following days. CrankyTemplar put out a crowning, nearly two hour-long supercut of beating every boss without taking damage on Thursday, September 11⁠—exactly one week after the game released. For a game widely agreed to be extremely challenging, one that PCG contributor Tyler Colp called \"worth the pain\" in his 90% review of Silksong , I find this to be a staggering accomplishment for how quickly CrankyTemplar managed it.

The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom.

    "body": "Quake and Quake 2 are, famously, very different shooters. The original is a dark gothic fantasy with a side of HP Lovecraft, while the latter leans hard into industrial sci-fi. I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot. The mod's premise sees your character allying with the race of gods that Quake 1 bosses Chton and Shub-Niggurath descended from, after the Strogg took their remains and,…",

Every other game seems to support larking around for up to four people. And in the increasingly unlikely event that a game doesn't have co-op to begin with, chances are someone will make a version of it that does. Such is the case with Keep Digging , which lifts the premise of DoubleBee's surprise hit A Game About Digging A Hole , er, wholesale, opens up its shovelling shenanigans for up to eight players, then rests its hard hat over its eyes for a wee nap while the cash rolls in. Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries. I presume the latter are used to power some other excavation device, but the Steam page just reads \"batteries\" so it isn't clear.

The game just came out! It's not like developer Neowiz was licensing chart-topping pop tunes to include in its soundtrack. No, the reason for their familiarity is far more interesting: a good chunk of the game's score includes rearranged songs from my favourite PC rhythm game. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. Neowiz is also the studio behind the DJMax series—starting off as an Asia-exclusive online PC game before moseying off to PlayStation for a number of years, finally returning to desktops in 2020's DJMax Respect V. The game's music library is chock full of tracks, from original pieces to collaborations with other games like League of Legends and Tekken. There's K-pop, metal, hip-hop—if there's a song genre, there's a good chance DJMax has a composer for it.…",

BI's biggest and best milsim to date has kept players satisfied for more than a decade, mainly thanks to its thriving and endlessly creative community, though a host of DLC has helped too. If you haven't braved Arma 3's hyper realistic battlefields, now might be the time to do so. The game is currently 90% off, making it cheaper than a cup of coffee. The discount is part of Bohemia Interactive's Steam publisher sale , which has most of the Czech studio's cheaper than usual. Arma 3 for $3 (£2.50) is by far the best deal of the bunch, though. The single-player campaign, which was released over a period of three years, is pretty strong. But really it's the multiplayer where Arma 3 is at. Whether you're playing ops with friends, building your own scenarios, or getting involved with RP servers like Arma life , it has tons of different experiences to offer. If you want to go all-in, you can get Arma 3 plus all its key DLC for less than the RRP of the base game. While most o…",
