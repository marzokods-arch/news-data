    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The November Pixel update doesn’t list the Pixel 6 or Pixel 7 series because those devices already received all necessary fixes with the September patch. Google’s Pixel Update Bulletin confirms there are no new security patches for Pixel phones in this update, so no additional update was needed this month. The November Pixel Feature Drop still applies to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 phones, so they aren’t missing out on any new features. Google rolled out the November Pixel update earlier this week, right alongside the latest Pixel Drop . The update brought new improvements and bug fixes to the Pixel 7a and above. Naturally, users quickly noticed that the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro were missing from the list of devices receiving Google’s monthly bug-fix update.

    "summary": "Android 17’s new Contacts Picker may provide a privacy-preserving way for apps to read your contacts.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new Contacts Picker tool for Android 17 to fix the current all-or-nothing contacts permission. This tool will allow you to share specific contacts with an app, rather than your entire contacts list. Access will be a one-time snapshot, and apps can request only the specific data fields they need. Your device’s contacts list holds a treasure trove of sensitive data that many apps want to get their hands on. Fortunately, Android’s permissions system prevents apps from accessing your contacts without your knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s an all-or-nothing system: You either grant an app access to all your contacts or none of them. This is highly problematic because it forces you to grant many apps full access to your contacts even if they don’t need it. Next year’s Android 17 update could tackle this problem by introducing a system Contacts Picker tool that allows you to select specific contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to your entire contacts list.

None of us enjoy suffering through the fallout of two big, insanely wealthy companies publicly spatting over their business arrangements — but that’s exactly what YouTube TV subscribers have been dealing with for the past two weeks, after YouTube failed to renew its deal with Disney . As a result, Disney’s whole slate of channel holdings, from ABC to ESPN , has been pulled from YouTube TV screens until something can be worked out. And while that stalemate continues, we’ve got at least some good news for sports fans who have been missing their regular fix. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Reports have been piling up about the Pixel speakerphone button feeling slow or unresponsive during calls, and a problem with such a fundamental function is bound to be frustrating. We wanted to determine the actual extent of the issue among our readers. We reported on the buggy feature last week , outlining what appeared to be happening and the possible reasons behind it. Pixel 9 owners first raised the alarm back in May, and Pixel 10 owners have since joined them. The behaviour often looks the same — you tap the speakerphone toggle and nothing happens, or it takes a beat or two before it lights up. Some users have found workarounds for the issue, but these shouldn’t be necessary, and Google’s response to one reader didn’t do anything to alleviate concerns. We ran a poll to get a clearer picture of how often this is happening among our readership.",

Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

Following its unveiling in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now available globally, featuring a slightly revised design, new colors, and impressive battery and charging speeds. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 15 eschews the flagship killer identity that the brand previously established and is instead surrounded by the aura of a true flagship.

This time, though, instead of creating a jack of all trades (which, to be fair, was a master of most of them), OnePlus is after power users — or at least, I think it is. The reason I say I think rather than I know is that despite testing this phone for a few weeks, I’m not quite sure how we got to this point. I know the OnePlus 15 is powerful on paper — it boasts the latest chipset, a large battery, ample RAM, and sufficient storage to prove it. But for everything that has improved, it feels like just as much has taken a step backward from a predecessor that is still one of the best Android phones you can buy .

For many, that trust will be difficult for Gemini to earn.

The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

The conflict is costing both parties. YouTube has been forced to issue refunds to customers for the unavailability of Disney-owned channels on YouTube TV and prevent them from cancelling subscriptions.

Although it packs a handsome set of features that make deep investigations far easier, features like audio and video overview make the learning process much more engaging. Inspired by its popularity, Google is extending one of these features to other apps. Google is now expanding NotebookLM’s audio overviews to PDF files saved in your Google Drive. With this, content from any PDF can be converted into audio summaries with the same interactive podcast style as NotebookLM’s audio overviews.",

This means your Snapdragon 8 Elite phone should see better performance and fewer bugs with the Switch emulator. This update also brings support for Windows on Arm devices as well as a variety of other optimizations and fixes. Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors.
