    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nx5OLMak2s The more we hear about the upcoming Galaxy S26 series, the more underwhelming this launch feels. For a second there, Samsung had all of us fooled with dreams of a refreshed line-up consisting of a new Galaxy S26 Pro, an Edge, and an Ultra, which would’ve been a nice departure from its traditional S, S Plus, and S Ultra plans. Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

While it may seem weird, it’s actually common practice in the world of not only smartphones but electronics in general. But who is this mysterious company behind your favorite smartphone, why do both Apple and Google use it, and which other companies are also on its client list?",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops. I’m still not sure how many of them I would trust as laptop replacements, but I’ve found that they fill so many more niches than they used to. Here are the best Android tablets that I think you should actually spend your money on.",

From setup to screen size, this $999 Google TV-powered projector delivers a brighter, bigger, and far more effortless viewing experience than a TV at the same price.

It also simplifies sharing between apps, meaning developers don’t have to build their own data transfer tools. When Google launched Health Connect in 2022, it supported just over 40 data types across six categories. With the release of Android 16 , Google expanded the service to include yoga and meditation sessions (“Wellness”) as well as medical records like allergies, vaccinations, and lab results. Most recently, the Android 16 QPR2 update brought native step tracking support to Health Connect.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android is getting a quality-of-life update that automatically turns on wireless debugging when connected to trusted Wi-Fi networks. Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S26 series in the next couple of months, and leaks continue to trickle in ahead of the mooted release window. Now, a Galaxy S26 Ultra listing has corroborated reports of faster charging. Twitter user @ZionsAnvin spotted a Galaxy S26 Ultra certification listing on China’s 3C regulatory website. We were also able to find this listing, which confirms the SM-S948 model number and 60W wired charging (20V/3A). Check out our screenshot below.",

In the Camera app, you can now use half of the screen to view recently captured images. The option has been available on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold since launch. I find foldables to be the ultimate productivity boosters . Not only does the extra real estate on the inner screen allow more content to be viewed at once, which can be helpful for reading, but it also serves what would typically require two screens. Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature. Meanwhile, Google only added it to its foldable lineup recently with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , and the feature has been exclusive to it since launch. Thankfully, t…",

    "body": "TL;DR JMGO has launched the JMGO O3, a compact and affordable ultra-short-throw (UST) laser projector. The unit is just 250 × 219 × 107mm and 2.4kg, far smaller than the O2S Ultra. It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

    "summary": "Like other foldables, the Galaxy Z TriFold lets you transition apps from the cover to the main screen, but there’s a catch.",
    "body": "TL;DR Enabling App Continuity on the Galaxy Z TriFold causes the device to lower the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen. Samsung lowers the cover screen’s rendering resolution to match the inner screen’s pixel density so apps don’t restart when unfolding. A hardware upscaler keeps the display looking sharp, but screenshots capture the raw, lower-resolution image before it is processed. Like most foldable phones , the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold sports two displays: an outer cover screen and an inner main screen. What makes the TriFold unique is that its inner screen folds twice, giving the device its signature look. In most other respects, though, the TriFold behaves like any other Samsung foldable. It supports App Continuity, for example, allowing you to seamlessly transition apps from the cover to the main screen. However, this feature causes an interesting quirk on the TriFold: it compromises the resolution of screenshots taken on the cover screen — but for good reason.

It features a 14-inch AMOLED display and up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 with 128GB of RAM. Pricing starts at $1899 during the crowdfunding campaign. Portable gaming hardware keeps getting more and more powerful, and the aptly-named Super X is here to bring desktop-level power to a two-in-one tablet design. It isn’t cheap, but it blows traditional devices like the Surface Pro out of the water. The OneXPlayer Super X packs up to an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 and 128GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful devices you can buy. It’s far from the only device with this chipset, but its killer feature is that it can transform between a tablet and a laptop. There’s a kickstand in the back, which, paired with the magnetic keyboard included with early bird purchases, turns it into a real portable powerhouse.",

It adjusts voltage from 5V to 20V at 3A and doesn’t require a 5A cable. Samsung is apparently making changes to its charging lineup with Super Fast Charging 3.0 , and the first official sign isn’t a big announcement from the company but a simple accessory listing. A new 60W power adapter has appeared on Samsung’s website , as spotted by Abhishek Yadav on X . The company hasn’t formally announced the charger yet, but the timing suggests it’s preparing for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to move past Samsung’s 45W charging limit .",

At an event in San Jose, California, Google gave my colleague C. Scott Brown a preview of the different styles of XR glasses it is working on.

It remains unclear whether the Gemini experience will run within the app or redirect users externally to the Gemini app. Gemini started off slow, but Google has made great progress in making the AI digital assistant actually useful. The reception from consumers is just as great, and it makes sense that Google would want all of its products to benefit from it . We’ve now spotted hints that Gemini could soon be coming to the Google Play Books &amp; Audiobooks app. Given how useful adding Gemini to a Kindle can be, adding Gemini to the Play Books app could change how people read books within Google’s ecosystem.

Samsung appears so confident of its effects that it also wants to sell it to clients such as Qualcomm. If that works out, we might see it being used on the rumored special version of Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Samsung’s Exynos chipsets have been relentlessly criticized and trolled for their heating issues. The poor heat management on Exynos chips has also contributed to throttling and their inability to sustain high performance for long enough, which has traditionally made them less desirable than Snapdragon-branded counterparts. But Samsung has refused to abandon that ship, and might have actually addressed it with the upcoming Exynos 2600, which could power some of the Galaxy S26 models in certain regions. Not just Samsung appears so confident in its solution that it’s ready to offer it to other companies, including Apple and Qualcomm. According to a recent report by the Korean outlet ET News , Samsung has formally announced its technology to address heat-related throttling issues on chipsets.
