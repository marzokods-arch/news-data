    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Leaker Evan Blass shared a Verizon certification for the Pixel 10a, revealing a 6.3-inch display and 5,100mAh battery. Most listed specs match the Pixel 9a. The listing confirms the codename “STA5” (Stallion) and describes the device as bringing Google AI at a great value. The Pixel 10 series dominated conversations after its launch, but it’s time to look forward to Google’s next phone release. The Pixel 10a is expected to be released next year, and while we’ve seen renders , there has been a surprising lack of leaks around its specifications and other details. That changes now, as a new leak is shedding light on key Pixel 10a specifications. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Innovative products such as the Galaxy Z TriFold and a folding iPhone could drive sales for the category. Meanwhile, sales of regular phones could decline or stagnate over the next few years. Worldwide smartphone sales have seen a meager growth in 2025. Different research agencies have cited growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 3% for the first, second, and third quarters of the year. Meanwhile, the foldable category expanded at a much faster rate, with Counterpoint reporting 14% year-on-year growth in Q3 2025, led by the success of the reinvented Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its rivals in the book-style format. In 2026, this growth could nearly double as new and innovative products, such as the Galaxy Z TriFold , help shape the future of the foldable segment. A more recent IDC report predicts that the foldable segment will grow steadily through 2029. The next year, i.e., 2026, specifically will see an enormous 29.7% year-on-year growth in foldable sales. In comparison, sales of regular smartphones are expected to decline by 1.4% as people keep their phon…",

This bug is the reason why the LibrePods app requires a rooted Android device. LibrePods brings features like ANC controls, ear detection, and more to AirPods on Android. An enterprising developer recently released an app called LibrePods , which enables a more feature-rich AirPods experience on Android. The app currently requires root access, and it turns out that a long-standing Android Bluetooth bug is the reason for this requirement. LibrePods developer Kavish Devar posted a bug report on Google’s Issue Tracker back on October 6, 2024 (h/t: Hacker News ), noting the specific code that’s standing in the way of root-free AirPods support. Over 9,100 votes have been cast on the issue, but the bug’s status has been marked as “assigned” by Google ever since then.",

    "body": "TL;DR Chrome Canary includes a new chrome:// page specifically for AI Mode. The native integration allows AI Mode to access your open Chrome tabs. We don’t know when this feature will make it to stable Chrome. AI Mode is Google’s attempt to combine its longstanding flagship product Search with a more chatbot-like experience, answering questions using info from the web by parsing and reiterating information from web pages in an interaction that feels like a plain-language conversation. Now, the company’s working on integrating that experience more directly into the Chrome browser, testing a new version of AI Mode inside Chrome Canary. As spotted by Windows Report , the latest Chrome Canary desktop build features a version of Google’s AI Mode that opens in Chrome itself at chrome://contextual-tasks rather than directing the user to an external Google Search tab on the web. The interface is quite similar to the web implementation, showing the same Meet AI Mode heading and “Ask anything” text box.",

Units ship in March. Following its teaser yesterday, storied smart wearable maker Pebble has announced its latest device — and it isn’t what I expected. Today, the company is introducing the Pebble Index 01, its first-ever ring-style device. But an Oura competitor this is not: the Index 01 is tailor-made for some specific use cases, and it’s priced to move at a reduced pre-order cost of just $75. Unlike typical smart rings, the Index 01 doesn’t track activity or sleep. The company describes it as a “memory device,” designed primarily to record voice notes in the Pebble companion app on your phone. Recordings are processed and stored locally by default and there’s no subscription required to use the ring, though “an optional cloud service” allows for online backups and better-quality speech-to-text.",

More specifically, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 runs the Ultra model across all regions. The Galaxy S26 is set to launch sometime in early 2026. The exact launch date remains unclear, with leakers divided on whether Samsung’s last-minute changes (or rather, the reversal of those changes) to the lineup could lead to a delay. Similarly, there have been speculations about the chip of choice, with leaks suggesting Samsung might equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra, along with the other two models, with an Exynos chip instead of a Snapdragon in some regions. While the launch date remains uncertain, a recent certification might put speculation about the chipset to rest. The Galaxy S26 Ultra recently visited the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), which certified it ahead of the launch. The certification document (via The Tech Outlook ) includes different variants carrying SM-S948B, SM-S948B/DS, SM-S948U, and SM-S948U1, where U refers to the US variant, while B refers to the international variant…",

Last year’s Pixel 9 phones put the series on a better trajectory, despite the still questionable modem and Tensor G4 processor. With the Pixel 10 series, however, Google promised its best battery life yet — 30+ hours on a charge! — thanks to an optimized Tensor G5 and larger batteries on all models. This claim is one of the reasons I chose to upgrade from my Pixel 9 Pro XL. My experience had been pretty average for a whole year, starting pretty decently, but then getting to a point where the battery would die by mid-afternoon on busy travel days, where I’d be using the camera and maps frequently for several hours on 4G or 5G. I hoped the Pixel 10 Pro XL would fix this, but so far, I’m just left scratching my head.",

The additional fold on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has allowed Samsung to increase the battery size on the TriFold while retaining the same camera system.

Prices range from $1,699 to $2,399. If you’ve ever wondered what a Kindle-like display would look like scaled up to the size of your torso, PocketBook now has an answer. The company’s new InkPoster lineup brings full-color e-paper to framed, wall-mounted displays, delivering a matte, print-like aesthetic you can personalize. The 31.5-inch model starts at $1,699, while the upgraded 28.5-inch IGZO version comes in at $2,399, positioning these firmly in the premium decor category. The beauty of the idea is that modern color E Ink panels achieve a paper-like look without glare or backlighting. Meanwhile, E Ink only draws meaningful power when an image changes, so the posters can theoretically hold artwork for months on a charge. Through a companion app, users can browse curated galleries or upload personal photos, turning a static wall into a rotating art exhibit, but with the visual calm of printed media.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR The December Drop for Pixel phones introduced a significant display bug for some users. According to users’ reports, the display on their Pixel 10 randomly freezes after the phone has been resting for a while. This isn’t the first display bug that the Pixel 10 users have been facing. The December Pixel Drop, which arrived exactly a week ago , was primarily aimed at eradicating a punch list of issues troubling users of the Pixel 6 and above. But in fixing those bugs, Google may have triggered a handful of new ones. After we learned about a relatively less bothersome snag with single-handed mode or an unsightly glitch with the always-on display , we’re learning of a major issue that could potentially impact a broader set of Pixel 10 users. Reddit user tstrmr recently posted about the display on their Pixel 10 Pro XL becoming unresponsive randomly. The issue specifically occurs when the phone is locked and sat down for a certain duration, following which the display stops registering touch at all.",

The fast and chaotic montage pulls together many of the moments people kept asking about this year to summarize the last 12 months and add a touch of nostalgia. You can watch it above. The film has its own angle, built around a “reimagining” concept that pops up a few times, mixed with some big soundtrack choices. It starts with Ozzy Osbourne’s Crazy Train, swings into Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra, and eventually settles into Golden, performed by various artists.

Users will likely need to toggle off Advanced Protection Mode to regain the ability to unlock their Pixel phone via their Pixel Watch. The Google Pixel Watch features a Watch Unlock function that allows you to use the smartwatch as a key to unlock your Pixel phone. This is very convenient, as it replaces the need for a traditional passcode or biometric identification as long as you’re wearing the watch (and it’s connected to your phone).
