The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 38-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career.

According to local outlet PerthNow , 20-year-old Beau William Loch Rollings and 23-year-old Rory Hugh Culbert jumped a safety barrier and scaled the central tower inside the stadium bowl, clinging to the structure at heights reportedly between 10 and 50 meters for around 20 minutes while the concert continued. The stunt triggered a major security response as venue staff and police moved in, with thousands of fans watching the incident unfold mid-show. Police later seized the pair’s phones, which contained footage of the climb, as part of the trespass investigation. Magistrate Ruth Dineen was blunt in her assessment, describing the tower climb as “an incredibly stupid thing to do and a good way to ruin your night out,” noting that what “seemed funny at the time” had escalated into a serious safety issue. Defence lawyer Rachael Gemmell characterized it as “just stupid behavior,” arguing the experience had been sobering for the young fans.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority Google’s second major quarterly release of Android 16 — known as Android 16 QPR2 — is finally here, bringing plenty of new features to Pixel owners, and eventually other brands as well. According to anecdotal reports from the usual corners of the internet, one unexpected bonus appears to be improved graphics performance for the Pixel 10. Google hasn’t officially mentioned a new GPU driver that Pixel 10 owners have been waiting for, but that doesn’t mean that minor improvements or optimizations aren’t tucked away inside. To find out, I grabbed my Pixel 10 Pro XL running the November 2025 patch, ran our usual test suite, and then updated to the QPR2 December 2025 update and tested again.",

Whether I’m craving pizza, need to calculate compound interest, find a tailor for a shirt alteration, or check the current Premier League scores, I can accomplish all of these tasks with an app of some description. So naturally, when it comes to customizing my phone’s wallpaper, I’ll use a dedicated wallpaper app . According to a recent reader poll , though, not every Android Authority reader agrees. Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours. With this in mind, I’ve made a point to go a step further with my phone customization and create my own wallpapers to bring a real personal touch to my device. For those who want to do the same, here are some ways I go about this.",

With the Pixel 10 series shipping out of the box with built-in Qi2 and Qi2 25W , we thought things would finally be standardized and that we wouldn’t have to think about which charger we’re using with which phone. Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers.

That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

    "body": "Credit: Andrew Grush / Android Authority TL;DR Starlink filed new trademarks, including “Starlink Mobile” and “Powered by Starlink”, covering cellular communication services and delivery of video and data to mobile devices. The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

Smartwatch fans may have spotted a notable omission from this year’s holiday sales. The Mobvoi TicWatch lineup has been a steady presence in the Wear OS world for years, but most of its watches seem to have slipped away from retailers without much fanfare. You can’t currently buy them on either Amazon or Mobvoi’s own website, which seems to be an ominous sign that the lineup is fading out. As reported by 9to5Google , all TicWatch listings on Amazon have essentially disappeared . On Mobvoi’s site, the watches have been removed from the product listings, and even the odd ones that can be navigated to via banners lead to a notice stating that the product is unavailable when you click the buy button.",

The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to bring a major redesign for its system apps. Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

As of this morning (9 am PT/noon ET), the for both the new Kindle Scribe and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft now show an official December 10 availability. The shift follows recent retailer listings and early press reports suggesting that Amazon’s next-gen note-taking readers wouldn’t land until early December. With today’s update, the company has now effectively locked in the US launch window without issuing a formal announcement. Amazon is also now offering the option to sign up for an email alert when the products officially go on sale.

A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",

From the notification panel to the Settings app to the lock screen and beyond, Google redesigned nearly every system interface visible to the user. However, Android is a huge OS, so Google missed a few parts during the initial overhaul, such as the Package Installer that handles sideloading apps.

It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",
