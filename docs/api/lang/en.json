The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. StarBurst is designed to detect the initial emission of short gamma-ray bursts, some of the most powerful explosions in the universe and a key indicator of neutron star mergers. This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed. To date, only one such event has been observed simultaneously in gravitational waves and gamma-rays; StarBurst is expected to find up to 10 per year. StarBurst arrived at NASA Marshall in March 2025.

The rated battery capacity for the upcoming midsize flagship matches that of its predecessor, and Samsung is still using a lithium-ion battery. The wired charging speed is unchanged, too, with the Galaxy S26 Plus certified to support 45W over a cable. A new year means new Samsung Galaxy phones aren’t far away, and the upcoming Galaxy S26 series is rumored to launch as soon as next month. As we get closer to the expected launch window for the Samsung Galaxy S26 models, regulatory and third-party certifications clarify specifications about the devices ahead of their official unveiling. Now, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus has been spotted by The Tech Outlook on the TUV database. The certification reveals the exact battery capacity and charging speed for the upcoming midsize Galaxy phone. The unnamed Samsung phone spotted on the TUV certification database is identified with the model number SM-S947B/DS, which previous leaks revealed is the model number of the Galaxy S26 Plus .

Nothing says a future update will let Phone 3a Lite users uninstall Lock Glimpse. Nothing phones started getting Android 16 with the rollout of Nothing OS 4.0 in November . On Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro , and 3a Lite, the update included a feature called Lock Glimpse, a widely panned addition that served ads on those phones’ lock screens. Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it. That solution wasn’t satisfactory, though, as users found the software was draining their batteries even when turned off . Today, Nothing shared that the feature is being removed from the 3a series (except the 3a Lite) as of the Nothing OS 4.0 December update.",

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands. Based on a rumor shared by a Weibo account with the username “Fixed-focus digital cameras ,” Apple tore apart an OPPO Find N5 while trying to decode what enables the screen’s crease to be so minimal.",

The Find N6 is expected to be a powerhouse with a 200MP primary camera, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and a 6,000mAh battery. The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete. Samsung won’t be the only Android brand launching two book-style foldables this year, as it appears even OPPO will join the party with its own wide foldable.

If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

The NAD found some T-Mobile claims about competitor price hikes and satellite coverage to be exaggerated or unsubstantiated, while others were reasonable and supported. Unsurprisingly, T-Mobile has clarified plans to appeal the decisions it disagrees with. It’s no secret that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile’s rivalry has intensified significantly over the last half year or so. AT&amp;T not only unveiled an ad campaign around T-Mobile’s so-called Un-Truths late last year, but it also sued its rival over T-Mobile’s new Switching tool, and it even brought complaints of false advertising to the National Advertising Division (NAD). The NAD has now officially responded to the complaints, agreeing that T-Mobile might have gone a bit too far with some of its recent claims. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Ballie has shifted from a planned retail product to an internal “active innovation platform,” meaning it’s now for Samsung’s labs. Samsung’s cute, rolling robot assistant, once promised for homes by summer 2025 , has now been shelved. This shift marks a sudden turn from the optimism Samsung showed when Ballie was first introduced in 2020. The small, round robot was meant to be a mobile smart home assistant that could follow you, control devices, and project images onto walls. Now, Samsung is effectively putting an end to hopes for a commercial launch.",

Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

You’ll be able to add AI-generated weather effects to your lock screen wallpaper based on local weather conditions. Effects like rain or snowfall realistically move behind visible objects or people, rather than simply sitting on top of the wallpaper image. Smartphone brands have been paying extra attention to the lock screen lately, treating it as more than just a place to check notifications or check the time. From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update looks set to continue that trend with a new weather-driven feature that adds a bit of magic to your wallpaper, and closely mirrors a similar idea Google already offers on Pixel phones.

Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees.

Every year, alongside the headline-grabbing TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, there are products that don’t always get the same attention but still shape everyday life. Pool care is one of them. For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it.

These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

No one can really stop YouTube from running more ads on the platform or increasing the length of unskippable commercials, which currently go up to 30 seconds. However, one country is now fighting back, not with popular opinion, but actual laws.",

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR AWOL Vision’s new Aetherion series features two high-end UST projectors — the Max and Pro — offering sharp 4K resolution up to 200 inches, along with advanced features such as PixelLock for refined image quality. Both models support cutting-edge standards, including Dolby Vision Gaming, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, and Filmmaker Mode. They feature MediaTek’s MT9655 chip and run Google TV based on Android TV 14. Kickstarter launches in early February at $2,199 (Max) and $1,999 (Pro), with retail availability starting in April for $4,499 and $3,499, respectively. Projectors are fast emerging as a popular alternative to having a giant TV in the living room , and it makes sense, too. Instead of having a TV imposing and commanding attention all the time, a projector moves out of the way when the job is done. At CES 2026 , we’ve seen numerous new projectors from companies such as Samsung , Epson , and XGIMI . If you’re still on the hunt for a performance-oriented projector, the new Aetherion projector from AWOL Vision could be worth checking out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The phone is also tipped to have a 6.3-inch 165Hz screen, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a 50MP tele camera. The OnePlus 13S/13T had a very limited release, but we hope the new phone is widely available. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 13T in China last year, which was known as the OnePlus 13s in India. This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",

At CES 2026, the company confirmed the shortage is already raising costs and admitted it’s actively considering repricing products to match the new reality. DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",
