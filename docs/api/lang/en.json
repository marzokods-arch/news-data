Skyhooks archivist Peter Green announced the news, writing that Starkie “passed away early this morning” after spending the past year undergoing treatment while still hoping to return to the stage.

Peter was one of the musicians who helped establish the early lineup that would go on to dominate Australian rock in the mid-1970s.
