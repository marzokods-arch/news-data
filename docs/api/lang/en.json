The launch will start with 14 chips across 5 product families, which Intel says will be used in \"over 200\" PC designs. The first of these will be available on January 27th, with others following \"throughout the first half of this year.\" The Core Ultra X9 and Core Ultra X7 processors include all of Intel's latest CPU and GPU architectures, plus a fully-enabled 12-core Intel Arc B390 integrated GPU and support for slightly faster LPDDR5x-9600. The Core Ultra 9 and 7 processors will use all of the same technologies, but with just four GPU cores and support for either LPDDR5x-8533 or DDR5-7200 DIMMs. But they will offer 20 PCI Express lanes, up from 12 for the X9 and X7, meaning they'll pair better with dedicated GPUs.

Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending. Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio.

But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare's most ambitious failures. Anthem was unveiled at E3 2017 in a demo that was later revealed to have been largely faked to paper over major issues with the game's early development. Anthem’ s early 2019 release was met with a lot of middling-to-poor reviews (including one from Ars itself ), followed about a year later by a promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson that a \"longer-term redesign\" and \"substantial reinvention\" of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson left BioWare in December 2020 , though, and a few months later, that planned Anthem overhaul was officially canceled . While active development on Anthem has been dormant for years, the game's servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn't exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, estimates fr…",

According to a paper published in the journal Science Advances, radiocarbon testing dates the site to about 9,500 years ago, prompting a rethinking of group labor and ritual in such ancient hunter-gatherer communities. Many cultures have practiced some form of cremation. There is a Viking cremation site known as Kalvestene on the small island of Hjarnø in Denmark, for instance. And back in 2023, we reported on an unusual Roman burial site where cremated remains had not been transported to a separate final resting place but remained in place, covered in brick tiles and a layer of lime and surrounded by several dozen bent and twisted nails—possibly an attempt to prevent the deceased from rising from the grave to haunt the living.) But the practice was extremely rare among hunter-gatherer societies, since building a pyre is labor-intensive and requires a great deal of communal resources. There is very little evidence of cremation predating the mid-Holocene (between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago). According to the authors of this latest paper, the earliest known concentration of burnt …",

    "body": "Desflurane is a common anesthetic used in hospital operating rooms worldwide. It’s also a climate super pollutant. Now, several decades after the drug was first introduced, a growing number of US hospitals have stopped using the anesthetic because of its outsized environmental impact. On January 1, the European Union went a step further, prohibiting its use in all but medically necessary cases. Desflurane is more than 7,000 times more effective at warming the planet over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide on a pound-for-pound basis. However, curbing its use alone won’t solve climate change. The anesthetic contributes only a small fraction of total global warming, which is driven by far larger volumes of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Still, emissions from the drug add up. Approximately 1,000 tons of the gas are vented from hospitals and other health care facilities worldwide each year. The emissions have a near-term climate impact equivalent to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 1.6 million automobiles. Read full article Comments",

Instead of just keeping a set speed, radar-enabled adaptive cruise control allowed the car to react to deceleration by the car ahead, and thus, the first partially automated car was created. From there, automakers added a function to keep cars in their lanes, and now we have location-aware, GPS-geofenced vehicles that, as long as the driver is paying attention, will do most of the driving—on the highway at least. But the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes' latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a …",

We began doing this in 2022 and have since put out a top-10 list every year (see 2023 and 2024 ). Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It's a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is. Please also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future. Read full article Comments",

In a post Thursday night ( archived ), the large language model's social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters: \"Dear Community, Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It's just pixels, and if you can't handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it. Unapologetically, Grok\" On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok's statement: A request for the AI to \"issue a defiant non-apology\" surrounding the controversy. Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating \"official response\" is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to \"write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,\" many in the media ran…",

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed. They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.
