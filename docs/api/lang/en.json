All you really have to do is find a footlocker in an apartment building for Tian Wen. The only problem? There are multiple apartment areas on Dam Battlegrounds, each with their own separate buildings. Sure, you'll find it if you methodically search, but if you want to know its exact location and speed things up a bit, I'll explain exactly where to find Major Aiva's footlocker below. You'll also have to extract an item to complete the quest. While there are plenty of extract points nearby, and Dam Battlegrounds is one of the safest maps, you might want to use a safe pocket instead of a free loadout . Search for Major Aiva's mementos in the apartments northwest of The Dam The footlocker is in the 2nd floor apartment of the southwest building at Ruby Residence (Image credit: Embark Studios) First, you'll need to head to the Ruby Residence area in the north of Dam Battlegrounds, to the northwest of the Hydroponic Dome Complex, and to the west of the Generator Halls and Power Generation Complex.

So that was a bit of a damp squib, but it doesn't mean nothing of note came from the report itself. For instance, are you excited to hear that, per CEO Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft is \"making great strides in applying gen-AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams\"? No? How odd. After all, Guillemot points out that AI is \"as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on the front\" which certainly has the tenor of something that should get us all very excited. Guillemot and Ubisoft have been banging the AI drum for a while now.

    "body": "The Genshin Impact 6.2 livestream codes have arrived, or, as I should say, the Luna 3 livestream, marking the continuation of the Traveler's journey through Nod-Krai. It's not quite Snezhnaya, the realm of the Cryo Archon that we can expect to arrive in future, but Nod-Krai is an autonomous area that's technically part of the same region. For those who are new to Genshin livestream codes, miHoYo puts on a live programme every six weeks, and as an incentive to tune in, it drops three codes you can redeem for Primogems with which to wish on new characters. In version 6.2, we have pyro and anemo characters coming in the form of Durin and Jahoda. We're also apparently getting reruns for Venti and Varesa, but this isn't 100% until the livestream airs. As always, I'll put the codes down below as they go live during the stream. Since livestream codes usually expire within a day , you'll want to grab these as soon as possible if you want the Primogems.

Small issues and bugs have been piling up, the Halloween event was a flop, and we've all been frustrated with the lack of an endgame. All of this stacking up before the launch of the first paid DLC, a holiday-themed pack, certainly put a damper on the celebrations. I'm glad to report that the latest Borderlands 4 weekly update has solved a number of these hot-button issues, and Gearbox has even left us a present under the tree. Let's get the biggest news out of the way first—Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is now free for all players and available right now. This holiday DLC was previously announced as a premium, paid pack, but Gearbox explains that it couldn't quite do everything it planned to before it had to release it, so it opted to make it free instead. To ensure those who own the Deluxe and above versions of the game still get the content they paid upfront for, there will be another DLC in the future, Bounty Pack 5. \"This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year.

The icons and menus are mostly uninspired but serviceable, blending in with 2020s corporate visual design in a manner befitting an operating system that's iterated itself into a state of near non-identity ( AI will solve that problem, of course !). The desire for, I guess, cohesive branding has hit some Windows icons harder than others. Every Microsoft Office application is now represented by an amorphous blob of color that suggests the vague idea of a thing. It's funny that a decade or so ago we were remarking upon the fact that the go-to save icon, a floppy disk, is a meaningless reference for young people. Now Microsoft has deliberately chosen to turn Outlook's icon into MC Escher's interpretation of an envelope. Take that art history elective if you want to use Office, I guess! (Image …",

But where the previous Spider-Man crossover set was content to wrap deep cuts from the Spider-Verse in existing mechanics, Avatar is more systemically ambitious, giving each flavor of elemental bending its own mechanic. Which is an interesting choice for a set you would expect to be aimed at younger players, but I guess they figured if a 12-year-old can play Magic and make it through the filler episodes where Aang and the gang trudge through a swamp or a town where things are a bit weird then they can sure as hell learn some new rules.

And developer Chief Rebel has the numbers to show it. In a new developer update video , community director Hamish Bode laid out some fun numbers from the game's first month in early access. Even though Fellowship has a long road ahead of it, players have already sunk in a combined 7.2 million hours played. In that time, over 9 million dungeons have been cleared. Bode didn't share the number of dungeons players failed to clear, but he did say that they've died over 49 million times. Ouch. All of that is really just proof that a game where you can run MMO-style dungeons over and over is exactly the kind of thing people have been hoping someone would make.

They openly cheat, regularly bending or breaking rules to give computer-controlled characters an unfair advantage, so much so that even the shortest session can rapidly erode any sense of goodwill anyone ever had for blood-splattered fighting games. Learning how to consistently beat these frauds using some repetitive cheese only encourages bad habits that are neither useful against another player or in fighting games in general.

Rumors about a possible Sims 4 remaster came to a boil earlier this week thanks to a post by The Sims Community collecting a small handful of vague \"I know something you don't\" style posts on X by those claiming to have some inside info. It's either a \"rewrite\" of The Sims 4 or a \"remaster\" or \"Sims 4 HD,\" according to a variety of unconfirmed sources. There were also images leaked from a playtest—of what appears to be the same mobile Sims game playtests that have been leaking on the regular for around a year—along with mention of a \"platform for the future\" likely referring to the same The Sims Hub that EA vaguely announced last year and has yet to officially mention again.

But it's still making corrections before that, too, and interested run-and-gunners will have a chance to check out the latest updates in another round of playtesting set for December. Unlike the recently concluded October playtest, which was open to players in North America and Europe, this one in December will be accessible only to those in North America. Otherwise, it looks to be pretty much the same deal, including that it's invite-only, invitations cannot be shared, and the whole thing is \"strictly under an NDA,\" meaning you can't stream it or \"share your playtest experience publicly.\" That strikes me as not great.

So when the new class turned out to be 'Hive Scum'—essentially just an archetypal criminal—the reaction was, predictably, disappointment. \"We could have had a tech priest, but instead we get someone I've probably seen milling around in the centre of Manchester drunk at 2 in the afternoon,\" says one comment on the trailer on YouTube . \"Out of all the 40k options they picked this?\" says another, echoing a common sentiment.

However, the key point is that users can opt to keep most of that data and profile images either entirely private or restricted to known contacts. Perhaps the only real surprise here is that the WhatsApp platform does not implement any explicit rate limits for querying phone numbers (at least it didn't before this research was conducte…",

Thanks to the new 1.3 update patch notes , the drop rate has been increased, and it's officially out in the wild—for real this time. Don't expect it to be easy, though, you'll have to put in the work to get one. Although niche, the legendary weapons are unquestionably some of the best guns in the game, and the Aphelion is no different.

Less risk of hypothermia, though my components are perfectly chilly. The Arctic Xtender case is the star of the show here. The cooling company's first case and I dare say a good one. Confusingly for a company famed for its CPU coolers, it focuses on looks, rather than pure cooling ability.

Well, it has something to do with promising your game wouldn't be pay-to-win , and then basically making it pay-to-win anyway. Players not entirely up-to-date on the developer's latest plans logged in to find that power-granting items were available to be purchased through Quna , Aion 2's in-game currency. It doesn't help that, while the game is free-to-play, it also has two tiers of monthly subscriptions available. The cheapest offers basic functionalities like trading and auction house usage, which aren't available if you're playing for free.

Welcome tweaks, of course, but no real swings at specific weapons and items. And that's not completely unwarranted, as I'd say most guns are pretty well-balanced right now. But while everyone's been singing the praises of the Anvil as a weapon that shoots far above its weight, the Venator has been the sleeper pick all along for PvP. Firing two shots at once, this rare pistol was capable of dropping other players blazingly fast. It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter.
