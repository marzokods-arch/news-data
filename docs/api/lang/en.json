We’ve already taken an early look at the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro design , as well as previewed some animations showing off new Buds 4 functionality .

The company has been speedrunning its retro gaming handheld releases in the latter half of 2025, but today’s reveal might be something special for fans of retro gaming. The ANBERNIC RG 477V, which was thoroughly leaked last month , is a new vertical handheld that brings together the best components of the company’s 2025 releases in a new form factor. As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games. The video also shows exceptionally small bezels, which isn’t the case for other vertical handhelds like the Retroid Pocket Classic .",

Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",

The “Clear Voice” feature has been renamed to “Auto Clear Voice,” and Google now notes that the feature uses more storage. A new chip on the playback screen appears when audio is enhanced with Clear Voice, allowing you to revert to the original audio if needed. Google added a Clear Voice toggle to the Recorder app for Pixels in December 2024, shortly after we had spotted the feature in development . Clear Voice reduces background noise during recording, making it quite handy for recordings. Google is now rolling out Recorder v4.2.20251104 to users, introducing a few changes to the Clear Voice feature, as well as introducing the account switcher into the app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Last month we got an early look at the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design, and today that’s joined by our first Buds 4 imagery. Much like prior generations, the Pro model gets silicone tips absent on the base Buds. Technically, this is still Cyber Monday , but considering how so many Black Friday deals got started very early this year, we wouldn’t blame you if much of your holiday shopping has already concluded. But for those of you who were waiting, plenty of great deals still remain — like the one we just shared on Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro . While those are some fantastic earbuds, we’ve eagerly been looking forward to Samsung’s next generation, as well, and today we’ve got a new teaser to share with you.

Sgr B2 is the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from our central supermassive black hole. While Sgr B2 has only 10% of the galactic center’s gas, it produces 50% of its stars. Astronomers want to figure out why it is so much more active than the rest of the galactic center. MIRI has both a camera and a spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. MIRI’s view reveals colorful stars punctuated occasionally by bright clouds of gas and dust. Further research into these stars will reveal details of their masses and ages, which will help astronomers better understand the process of star formation in this dense, active galactic center region.

After recently only finding some bare-bones references to Gemini projects in the UI, we can now get a much more flesh-out look at how it will operate. Right now you’ve got your pick of AI platforms, and while some are certainly more popular than others, many tend to offer the same — or at least very similar — functionality. And why not? When a feature works well, everyone’s going to want to implement their own version of it. Recently we’ve been thinking about that in the context of ChatGPT’s support for projects — compartmentalized workspaces where you can keep files and discussions about something isolated from the rest of what you’re working on. It’s been looking like Gemini has been preparing its own take on projects , and now we can finally give you a preview.

Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 interface brings heaps of changes to Galaxy phones and tablets. The aesthetic upgrades expected of this update chiefly focus on a new glass-inspired interface , more customizable quick settings, visually demarcated menus, and a 3D effect for icons . Meanwhile, the UI is also expected to bring iOS-like notification summaries and improvements to Now Bar . In addition to those, One UI 8.5 may also help limit unwanted notifications by blocking spammy apps. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could bring additional settings to prevent apps with excessive notifications from badgering you. Tipster Tarun Vats shared on X a couple of screenshots of an upcoming One UI 8.5 feature that would block apps that continuously display “excessive ads.”",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR MKBHD is shutting down the Panels app at the end of this month, citing issues with finding the right development team fit. You can no longer buy collections, and you must download existing wallpapers before the app is removed. Users will receive automatic pro-rated refunds for active subscriptions, and the app code is promised to be open-sourced after shutdown. Finding a good, free wallpaper for your Android phone is now very easy. Part of the reason for this is the prevalence of great resources in the form of apps and websites (like ours, which brings you fresh wallpapers every Wednesday ). YouTuber MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) also took a shot at distributing wallpapers with his Panels app. It was an ambitious attempt, with some early mistakes, but these were quickly rectified . Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Marques has announced that Panels is shutting down. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The feature reduces the steps required to swap SIMs after Google previously removed the SIM selector from the compose bar and buried it inside the profile page. The new method for switching SIMs is a helpful improvement, but still redirects to the profile section instead of switching SIMs instantly. Being able to quickly and easily switch SIMs while texting is an important feature for Google Messages users who use two different lines on the same phone. However, earlier this year, Google made that simple action more frustrating by burying the SIM switcher deeper in the UI and adding unnecessary extra steps to the process.

Buoyed by burgeoning industrial and agricultural sectors, the city’s population rose by 1.7 million people over the past four decades as its footprint on the West African landscape expanded several times over . Amid bustling new networks of roads, residential neighborhoods, markets, and workshops, lie signs of a much earlier era, when the city was the seat of a powerful pre-colonial kingdom. Remnants of ancient earthworks, thought to be among the longest in the world, can even be seen in images of the city captured from space. Benin Iya (sometimes called the Benin Earthworks, the Walls of Benin, and the Benin Moat) is a vast, cellular network of interlocking earthen walls, ramparts, and ditches that radiate outward from a central moat at the heart of the city. Built in sections over hundreds of years between the 7th and 14th centuries, the system was key to marking defensive, political, and economic boundaries and played an important role in maintaining order and stabili…",

Roughly 90 kilometers to the west are the similarly named Arkenu structures . These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock.
