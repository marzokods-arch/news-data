Swift dropped four new CD variants of her latest album, each featuring two acoustic tracks not found on the standard version of Showgirl . Now available in &#8220;limited quantities&#8221; on Swift&#8217;s official webstore , the CDs are described as having &#8220;brand new production by Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift and newly recorded vocals by Taylor Swift.&#8221; Fans can order the the limited-release CDs over a 24-hour period, through 7 p.m. ET Sunday &#8212; &#8220;while supplies last.&#8221; Each CD is priced at $7.99, and features cover art that&#8217;s different from that on the standard release. (Those who made it to a screening of The Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters this weekend will recognize the imagery.) &#8220;File this under &#8216;save your best for the finale&#8217;… I think my favorite moments from the tour were the acoustic surprises. So I went back into the studio with Max and Shellback to record acoustic/unplugged versions of a few of the Showgirl songs…",

Upon accepting the foundation’s Ray Harris Lifetime Achievement Award onstage at Atlanta’s Flourish by Legendary, Jam shared that “Ray Harris was so instrumental early in our careers with literally the first record that we did at SOLAR Records, which was ‘Wild Girls’ by Klymaxx. So to get an award from him with his name on it is absolutely amazing.” Calling the occasion a full-circle moment, Lewis added, “We’re just two guys who like to make music. You all are the ones who made them hits.” The foundation also awarded three other top awards. National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB) president/CEO James L.

On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift&#8217;s biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele’s 25 , which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2&nbsp;million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department , sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Luminate’s sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard ’s charts. All numbers in this story are for the U.S. only.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.
