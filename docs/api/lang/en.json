Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years.

Discovered back on June 4 this year , and patched on October 2, this vulnerability meant that users were \"susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system.\" This means someone could enable local code execution or grab information at \"the privilege level of the vulnerable application\".

    "body": "Graphics cards shouldn't melt. Some have . That's the reason for a device such as this one from Ampinel, which keeps a graphics card's power demands in check across the compact 12VHPWR and 12V-2X6 connectors. The Ampinel from aqua computer is a small device that connects to a graphics card's power connector. It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring. It does so through a few things: firstly, monitoring each of the six power channels; secondly, redistributing the load should any single channel exceed the maximum current that they are r…",

Until now, most advances in these areas have been discovered through trial and error, but a newly developed mathematical model, backed by experimental evidence, could be used to steer engineers in the right direction for the next generation of batteries. That's according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a report on research carried out by a team of engineers, mathematicians, and material scientists. Specifically, the study investigated the process of lithium-ion intercalation , the electrochemical schenanigans that take place in the batteries we use in watches, phones, and pretty much anything these days. When you charge up the batteries in such devices, lithium ions are driven from an electrolytic solution and jammed into a solid electrode by a voltage source. This process has been intensively studied over the years, and battery designers have typically resorted to using the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation to predict the behaviour of lithium-ion cells. However, the BV formula is…",

As games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said this week , no one really knows, but the speculation we're hearing from analysts and corporate finance experts is that EA's new owners aren't likely to shake things up in the immediate future, and will probably do what you'd expect: focus on its existing live service moneymakers as it pays off that $20 billion in debt. Philip Alberstat, managing director at DBD Investment Bank, doesn't foresee a Toys 'R' Us-style descent into bankruptcy as a result of the new debt on EA's balance sheet. \"EA generates approximately $7.5 billion annually from franchises like Apex Legends, Battlefield, and FIFA [now EA Sports FC],\" said Alberstat. \"That flow of cash gives EA a real capacity to service the $20 billion in debt. The Toys 'R' Us comparison gets thrown around, but in reality that was a dying retailer. EA has sustainable revenue from live services across multiple platforms.\" Beyond it…",

I don't understand why Bandai Namco hasn't shamelessly ripped off the latter with a My Hero Academia game that'd make approximately one billion dollars, but its latest videogame adaptation is at least inching in that direction. At last week's Tokyo Game Show I played about half an hour of My Hero Academia: All's Justice, which is out on Steam next February.

Sadly, not much has changed: The plague of stutters, crashes, and poor framerates has spoiled the launches of some of the biggest games of 2025. There's no one culprit for this widespread problem, but the industry's obsession with graphics is looking guiltier every day. Devs are increasingly happy to sacrifice acceptable performance at the altar of Unreal Engine 5's bells and whistles, serving up games that look slightly better than a handful of years ago (if you squint, and provided you drop a grand on a new video card).

The show didn't really do all that well critically, as far as I can recall: I don't remember anyone saying they liked it much, though I also didn't hear that it was absolutely terrible. Former Halo art director Marcos Lehto stated that he didn't hate the show, but said it was \" Not the Halo I made .\" The general consensus about the Halo show seemed to be just sort of… eh .

If you're wondering about that odd name, the Waaagh! is the name of the massive military campaigns the orks wage on the galaxy every now and then when they get feeling restless. It is, as the Fandom wiki describes it, \"war on an apocalyptic scale,\" in which \"whole civilisations are exterminated and defenders' armies laid to waste as the Orks plough ever onward in an unstoppable tide.\" The good news is that these things tend to burn themselves out: Once the Waaagh! (the exclamation point is mandatory) has killed literally everything else, the orks will start fighting amongst themselves, as one does. It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober! Warhammer Bundle is a mix of genres, so you may not find everything here to your liking: Inquisitor—Martyr, for instance, is an action RPG, while Vermintide 2 is a co-op shooter and Dakka Squadron is kind of an arcade …",

In a new trailer , developers Scumhead and Osiol have revealed that we don't have long to wait for the full game: Mohrta will release on Steam October 14 . There are so many new FPSes (and indie games in general) with retro throwback graphics and strange, \"you won't find this in triple-A\" art styles that it's harder than ever to stand out from the crowd. But Mohrta still caught my eye and won't let go. You play as some kind of interdimensional killing machine, an (allegedly) unfeeling assassin in head-to-toe armor that's part Jin-Roh, part Trench Crusade. Their face is covered by a gas mask under a wide-brimmed helmet like a British WWI soldier, but the rest of the ensemble is all plate mail, and they carry an assortment of both medieval and modern weaponry. The demo showed off the sword, a fast-firing pistol, and a classic trench gun-style shotgun, while the trailers have previewed stranger fare like playing cards you throw like shuriken, a pile bunker , or dual flails. Mohrta boasts a unique, decidedly un-Doom …",

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and EGS general manager Steve Allison both acknowledged in May of this year that the Epic Store sucks—or, as Allison put it more politically, that \"t…",

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

October has a treat in store for all you aspiring mayors, too: survival city builder Farthest Frontier is busting out of early access and going full version 1.0 later this month. This is excellent news for two reasons. First, even from its earliest days of early access, Farthest Frontier felt pretty darn complete. I played a ton of it in 2022, turning my struggling medieval town into a profitable city thanks to investing heavily in bees—only to have my waxy fortune stolen by bandits in a suspiciously well-timed heist . Farthest Frontier also has a surprisingly deep farming system involving crop rotation and soil fertility, seasonal weather that will have you dreading those bitter and dangerous winters, and a whole host of horrible diseases and afflictions your settlers will have to contend with, like dysentery, scurvy, typhoid, cholera, frostbite, rabies, and even the plague. My townsfolk had an outbreak of worms at one point, which is utterly gross. I even had issues with villagers needing treatment for bee stings because I'd built so many apiaries around the neighborhood. That's a deep simulation. The other…",

Released on September 22, the patch \"fixed faulty spam filters on Simon’s PC,\" according to the patch notes , which warned that \"users may still receive suspicious correspondence due to treemail 0.1 filtering process issues.\" Players immediately began checking Simon's email and quickly discovered a link to hotelsamsara.com , \"a new investment opportunity promising an out of this world experience.\" \"Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond,\" the site says. \"Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise.

I always thought the most logical next step for FIFA would be partnering with Konami's eFootball, which remains the most likely competitor to EA Sports FC (even if it's currently in the doldrums).

Indeed, we've met Doot MD before: that time he beat Elden Ring on his sax and that time he beat Shadow of the Erdtree on it . Plus, he regularly dips into games like Dark Souls and (the original) Hollow Knight to keep himself sharp. So I suppose I'm not too surprised, but I am impressed. Silksong hasn't even been out for a full month yet, and here this guy is literally freestyling his way through it in its entirety, on his first playthrough of the game.

I’m glad I did, because otherwise I would have missed a very exciting piece of news: one of the coolest, most innovative rhythm games on PC is finally coming out of early access. Rhythm Doctor is unlike any rhythm game I’ve played before—while I’m used to four, five, or even eight-button spreads, Rhythm Doctor only requires one finger and the humble spacebar. Notes skirt along an EKG to different rhythms, sometimes throwing multiple notes for me to keep track of each beat. The real joy of Rhythm Doctor, though, comes from its visuals. Each level has some wonderfully unique storytelling through its art and the things that are happening between (and often during) my button presses. From levels that play out like those dodgy mobile ads that flood the screen with notifications and glitches, to one level that’s so special I don’t want to spoil it here. Seriously, it’s one you have to play for yourself.

The good news is, you don't have to kiss it goodbye just yet. The bad news is, you probably should start thinking about an upgrade. I won't lecture you about upgrading your PC, as I assume you're in this situation because 1) you can't , or 2) you don't want to. I respect it. You're not alone: 32% of Steam gamers surveyed in September 2025 have yet to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11. If that's a similar figure outside of the gaming sphere—in any case, I'd guess a greater number of non-gaming machines are still running Windows 10—that could be a big problem for users and Microsoft. So, unless you're planning to use your Windows 10 PC with an air gap, otherwise known as unplugging it from the internet and any other networks, you'd better take note of Microsoft's end-of-life timeline here. I've gone through Microsoft's many, many support documents on this. Each page seemingly covers the same basic information but no page has all the information.

Both a killer budget-oriented GPU and a bit of an inconsistent mess, it is clear that the hardware is impressive, despite all the crashes we got while testing. What's even less impressive, however, is its performance alongside older processors. The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022. Where the B580 was once outshone by the 8GB AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT in the same test, they now stand neck and neck. However, it's n…",

One of the big takeaways from Black Ops 7's beta will be community sentiment, whether players are generally happy with what Treyarch has put out this year or whether the devs will have their hands full with complaints flooding in.

Unfortunately, as he calls it, this whole thing's going to result in more industry layoffs . Ah, it's happening again. The buyout is a leveraged buyout, which Darrah says means \"EA is going to have an additional $20 billion of debt on its balance sheet. Obviously, adding $20 billion to your balance sheet is going to require you to pay a lot of interest. If we look at EA's current financials, they're netting out about $1.1-1.2 billion each year. If that $20 billion is sitting at a 5% interest rate, that's $1 billion of interest that needs to be paid every year just to service that debt.\" He adds that, \"for a company that's as historically financially conservative as EA, you're going to be looking for additional cost savings. And for a company where a majority of your costs come from people, that is likely going to mean layoffs and studio closures.\" The only reason you shouldn't imagine me pus…",

In case you're not Saja Boys-pilled, here's a quick rundown on K-Pop Demon Hunters: Rumi, Zoey, and Mira are part of girl group Huntr/x—and also happen to be demon hunters, hence the name—with the movie following their story against demon boy band, the Saja Boys and protecting folk through strengthening the anti-demon barrier known as the Honmoon. It all sounds rather daft when I try and put it down on paper, but K-Pop Demon Hunters is wonderfully witty, both cribbing from and poking fun at K-Pop and K-dramas. It's a refreshing original story wrapped up in the excellent animation work seen in some of Sony's other recent ventures like the Spiderverse films. And, as someone who grew up deeply entrenched in second-generation K-Pop back in the late 2000s, the Saja Boys give me all the same fuzzy feelings that BigBang did back then.
