Indo Warehouse, officially launched in February 2022, has since grown from underground test events to global stages, pushing what they call Indo House — electronic music mixed authentically with South Asian culture. “We both loved music all our lives, but never thought we’d be pursuing it the way we are today,” Kahani recalls. He had left a career in tech during the pandemic to chase a creative calling, sensing a gap in South Asian representation in electronic music. An idea sparked on a beach in Mexico quickly became an obsession. After a series of New York showcases, he reached out to Merchant, who was already DJing and experimenting in music. Though he was skeptical at first, Merchant says everything changed when he saw live traditional vocals mixed with house records — and the way people moved to it in big American cities. “I was like wow, this is different,” he says. “I questioned — how are all these people on the dance floor loving this in the U.S.?” That moment planted the seed. By 2022, Indo Warehouse was born. Indo Warehou…",
