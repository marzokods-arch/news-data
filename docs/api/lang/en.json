In just a little over three months, it's now sold more than seven million copies, Team Cherry says . And no, for all you pedants out there: That's not just the number of players who've touched Silksong with a Game Pass subscription. \"Millions more\" have played on Xbox Game Pass, according to Team Cherry, which dropped the numbers while revealing that a free Silksong expansion is in the works for next year . \"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected,\" Team Cherry said in the blog linked above. \"Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.

The Diablo series is known for the secret cow levels that Blizzard playfully refuses to acknowledge despite revisiting the reference in several games. Diablo 4, however, doesn't have one yet, no matter how hard people are still trying to find it with every new update. All the people who haven't given up hope and continue to scour the world for clues were probably thrilled to discover Blizzard quietly included a secret boss event in the latest season.

An exact date still hasn't been announced, but Marathon is \"targeting\" a price of $40/£40/€35, putting it in line with big-time online shooters Helldivers 2 and Arc Raiders. \"Purchasing Marathon will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses,\" Bungie said. \"This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon's Cryo Archive in Season 1.\" Also like Helldivers, Marathon's reward passes will not expire , and will remain available for purchase even after new passes come out—although to be fair, Helldivers lifted that idea from Halo Infinite .

The studio's second game was an instant hit, introducing a new crowd to extraction shooters with its semi-casual shooting, astonishing maps, and surprisingly chill social dynamics. Sammelin spoke to the huge response to Arc Raiders at launch, touching on the unexpected strategies players have adopted, designing each map to evoke a different playstyle, and how pleased he is to see some players adopting a \"talk first\" approach to PvP. We also asked Sammelin if there's any truth to the theories that Embark matches players partially based on their \"niceness.\" In the example our interviewer gave, it would make sense for Embark to match players who clearly preferred pacifist runs with like-minded raiders, especially in solo Q. Sammelin was cagey about the details, but did confirm that player behavior is a factor in matchmaking. Sammelin: \"Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.\" PCG: \"But you can't say anymore?\" …",

It's a short line from the end of the original campaign after defeating Lilith where she says, \"Without me, you would have no victory.\" Apparently, she meant that literally because Blizzard has confirmed that she's coming back for one final showdown. You won't be fighting each other though. She's going to help you kill her dad, the Lord of Hatred himself, Mephisto. This probably explains why everyone makes such a big deal about you having Lilith's blood. I've played every season since Diablo 4 was released and someone is always talking about how you have demon blood in you, and it's never made clear why that matters. Her return in Lord of Hatred will be big for all her fans out there, which includes me. A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell. Sure she's a little manipulative and very evil, but she kind of had a point. The writers who worked on Lord of Hatred are fully aware of the grey area she's in when it comes to her morality. …",

This includes one of New Vegas' most memorable characters, Mr. House, a tech tycoon kept alive by a supercomputer who runs the post-nuke Vegas, and who'll have a major role in season 2 of the show. \"My own sense of Mr. House has changed as we've seen the rise of Silicon Valley would-be messiahs,\" says Gonzalez. \"One of the things that now seems prescient is the fixation, the fascination they have with technological immortality. \"But Mr. House is unique in that he was able to calculate when the Great War was going to occur within a window of a few days⁠—he was just a couple of days short of getting the platinum chip.

Samsung may announce as soon as January that it will be ceasing production of SATA SSDs—at least, according to the multiple industry sources that gaming and tech news channel Moore's Law Is Dead claims to have spoken to. This report predicts that the winding down of SATA SSD production will contribute to already rising storage prices over the next two years. The Moore's Law Is Dead report reasons that, with so much of system and storage memory stock being eaten up by the rapidly expanding AI industry, it makes sense that Samsung would move away from more budget consumer fare like SSDs with a SATA interface. In fact, Samsung announced it was partnering with Nvidia on an 'AI Megafactory' back in October. But besides the current AI-dominated landscape, NVMe SSDs can also be cheaper to produce while also reaching speeds uni…",

And I know at least some of you feel the same, because someone's gone out of their way to make a tool dedicated to removing all Windows 11's AI features .

After all, if you're getting cosy with certain boons in one run, it's easy to feel like the wax wings have been melted out from under you when a patch snatches that away. Talking to our friends over at GamesRadar , creative director Greg Kasavin seeks to soothe that particular ache: Kasavin uses the example of the Smithy Sprint, which was cut from the game during the Olympus Update . For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx.

Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition. So how does one go about testing and ultimately reviewing a product that hardly anyone will be able to buy?

It contained locations, textures, and even whole NPCs that were ultimately cut to get the finished game down to a more workable size. But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return. There are actually a few mods bringing Marilyn back, but I went with the straightforward Marilyn Restored for my current loadout. On the subject of Mr. House, the skeevy Steve Buscemi-looking original depiction of the character is also back thanks to Restored Beta Mr House , and if you really want to go all the way his Lucky 38 casino was supposed …",

The announcement has sent a bunch of people back to Larian's last RPG in the Divinity setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2, which has bounced back into the list of most-played games on Steam. At the time of writing it's number 228 in the top 250 and according to Steam Charts it hit a 24-hour peak of 10,898 players, which is almost double last month's peak of 5,930 players. Though the numbers are lower, similar percentages have been checking out the earlier Divinity games, with the original Divinity: Original Sin going from a monthly peak of 941 players to 2,150, while Divinity: Dragon Commander (the result of a strategy game and a dating sim walking into a bar at the same time) went from 14 players to a whole 23.

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",

Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\".

Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best.

There was a specific moment while playing Diffusion where it shifted from being merely a highly capable Half-Life mod to one of the most remarkable conversions of Valve's classic FPS I've ever played. It's a moment reminiscent of Xen's reveal in Crowbar Collective's remake of Black Mesa, a sense of wonder imbued in equal parts by the sci-fi vista placed before you and the fact you know that it's running on the technical equivalent of a restored 1930s sedan. Then, several hours later, Diffusion did it again, at which point I began to understand why it took ten years to make. (Image credit: Valve/Aynekko) Diffusion is a total conversion project for Half-Life that's built in Xash3D, an open-source engine fully compatible with Half-Life's underlying GoldSrc tech.

Crucially, the originally-named Bicycle Mod for GTA IV isn't a daft model swap. Those familiar with the GTA 4 modding scene will likely have tried the suite of broken bike 'em ups that've graced the gritty streets of Liberty City, but in this instance, creator Shvab has thrown themselves into GTA 4's ageing vehicle logic, disabling engine health, bypassing fuel-tank explosions, and preventing NPCs from trying to 'start the engine' on a literal bicycle. There's even a custom IK system so Niko's feet land properly on the pedals. As Shvab puts it: \"I wanted it to feel like GTA 4 always meant to have bikes—not like some clunky workaround.\" The mod is open source too, which means Liberty City's most chaotic engineers are already plotting upgrades. Planned features include a proper bunny hop and the ability to stand while riding—presumably so you can flee the cops at a blistering 12 mph while looking even more ridiculous. Shvab says the m…",

Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches.

In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.
