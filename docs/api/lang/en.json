Sgr B2 is the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from our central supermassive black hole. While Sgr B2 has only 10% of the galactic center’s gas, it produces 50% of its stars. Astronomers want to figure out why it is so much more active than the rest of the galactic center. MIRI has both a camera and a spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. MIRI’s view reveals colorful stars punctuated occasionally by bright clouds of gas and dust. Further research into these stars will reveal details of their masses and ages, which will help astronomers better understand the process of star formation in this dense, active galactic center region.

Several of these formations, including Jabal Arakanū, display striking ring-shaped structures. Jabal Arkanū (also spelled Arkenu) lies in southeastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. Several other massifs are clustered nearby, including Jabal Al Awaynat (or Uweinat), located about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast. Roughly 90 kilometers to the west are the similarly named Arkenu structures . These circular features were once thought to have formed by meteorite impacts, but later fieldwork suggested they resulted from terrestrial geological processes. Arkanū’s ring-shaped structures also have an earthly origin. They are thought to have formed as magma rose toward the surface and intruded into the surrounding rock. Repeated intrusion events produced a series of overlapping rings, their centers roughly aligned toward the southwest. The resulting ring complex—composed of igneous basalt and granite—is bordered to the north by a hat-sha…",

Wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries in the U.S., with its annual hauls accounting for more than half of the country’s total yield. The wetlands, cool climate, and sandy, acidic soils of central and northern Wisconsin provide the foundation for raising the tart berry successfully. This satellite image shows geometric networks of cranberry beds alongside small lakes near the town of Warrens, the “Cranberry Capital of Wisconsin.” It was acquired with the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 on October 13, 2025, during the autumn harvest season.
