So popular, in fact, that it's even a surprise to developer ArenaNet. The game's recent remaster, Guild Wars Reforged , launched Wednesday as a free update for existing players and an inexpensive way to get in for newbies. While most Guild Wars fans are on to the game's more traditionally MMO-ish sequel , Reforged still brought the game's concurrent player peak on Steam up to over 5,000 at time of writing, according to SteamDB . That may not sound like a lot, but it's floated for the last several years at around 200-600, and since the game came to Steam relatively late in its life, there's likely a big contingent of people playing on the standalone client available on ArenaNet's website (anecdotally, that's how I play both Guild Wars games when the mood strikes).

You also get temporary buffs to repair, XP gain, and materials from Scrappy at the start of next season. It's officially 1 skill point per Million in value from r/ArcRaiders In addition to the guaranteed rewards, you'll get bonus skill points on your new raider contingent on the value of your stash and coins: One extra skill point for every one million coins you've accumulated by December 22.

What's the best inventory system in PC gaming? Resident Evil 4 's grid-based briefcase has certainly echoed through the generations, though you could argue it simply builds upon work done in PC games like Deus Ex and System Shock 2. A cursory Internet search also brings up suggestions like Minecraft for its simplicity, and Death Stranding for how deeply inventory management is intertwined with the core experience.

But the biggest planned patch of 2025 was the naval update, which aims to expand Rust's survivalist battles to the oceans, letting players build their own ships and exchange cannon blasts in seaborne conflicts. But players hoping to get their pirate on in Rust will have to keep their powder dry a while longer, because the naval update has been delayed. In a blog post on Facepunch's website titled \"Shipwrecked\", COO Alistair McFarlane explained the situation: \"For almost 12 years we have managed to deliver weekly updates or, in more recent years, guaranteed monthly updates with meaningful changes. It has become part of Rust’s identity. Turning up, every month, without fail. Not today,\" he wrote. \"We took on too much. The naval update is massive, lots of new systems, touching old ones, and the closer we got to patch release, the less confident and happy we were with the state of it.\" Facepunch apparently considered pu…",

At the time, I speculated this would be the long-awaited addition of a third playable faction to the RTS, and I was right! Well, sort of. Tempest Rising's third faction is playable now in the RTS, but only in beta, and only for the next two weeks. That third faction is The Veti, an alien race with ancient Egyptian stylings originally encountered in the latter third of the single-player's parallel campaigns. They're radically different from the RTS' existing human factions—the technologically advanced GDF and industrious, inventive Tempest Dynasty—summoning buildings rather than constructing them, and attacking their enemies with laser-toting floating pyramids and ground troops that shoot bees. Slipgate explained how the Veti function in a Steam post , outlining three fundamental mechanics. First, the Veti can convert slain enemies to their side, reanim…",

November's bike patch brought bicycles, scooters and associated infrastructure to player-created metropolises, and now, developer Colossal Order has finally added its hotly anticipated asset editor too. As Colossal Order concedes in a recent Steam post , development of the asset editor has been \"long underway\", with the community clamouring for it more or less since the sequel launched. The developer admitted in March that the editor had \"proven more technically challenging than initially anticipated\". Citing issues such as lingering Unity dependencies and the large amount of in-built assets affected by the editor's addition. In any case, those issues have seemingly been resolved.

In the clip, Lucy is up in the mouth of Dinky the T-Rex, the enormous plaster dinosaur that looks over the Dino Dee-lite motel and served once as the Dino Bite gift shop—as well as the sniper perch for Boone, the (unquestionably) best companion in Fallout: New Vegas. Take a look: As we can see in the clip, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) have been running a scam that sounds a bit like the con from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: turn over an outlaw (in this case, The Ghoul) to the authorities (who appear to be the Great Khans, a faction from Fallout: New Vegas) and collect the bounty. Then, while the outlaw is being hanged, shoot the rope and \"use whatever violence necessary\" to kill everyone and escape with both the money and their lives. Little snag, I guess: Lucy, the former Vault-dweller, is a nice person, and is reluctant to shoot The Ghoul free while he dangles there at the end of the rope, much to his di…",

Tagawa was a classic 'that guy' actor, with IMDB listing credits in more than 140 films and television shows going back to an uncredited appearance in the 1986 Kurt Russell classic Big Trouble in Little China. It didn't take long for bigger roles to follow: I recall seeing him first in an episode of Babylon 5 (yes, I am a B5 nerd), in which he played a cool, quiet, capable guy who took care of a problem while other people focused on other things—a description that could probably be applied to many of his roles, really. Tagawa appeared in everything from big-budget films to long-forgotten TV series over his long career. In 1987 he was \"Asian buyer\" in an episode of MacGyver and \"Thug in Flashback\" in the low-budget action flick Bulletproof; he also had a speaking role as Chang in The Last Emperor, which won nine Academy Awards that same year. He turned up in everything from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Walker, Texas Ranger to Planet of…",

Every season you can fill out a battle pass of sorts that unlocks fancy weapon skins, and people quickly spotted a curious looking weapon on the info page for the upcoming Season of Divine Intervention. Under \"additional bonus rewards\" there's a flail alongside a mace and a glaive, and unless they're giving necromancers a new weapon type, I think we're looking at a clear hint at paladins making their way to Sanctuary immediately.

Now it seems the game most likely to usurp it is Slay the Spire 2 , which is coming in March 2026—though there was apparently a 50% chance that the indie team at Mega Crit Games would never make a sequel. \"We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'\" Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told PC Gamer in an interview for The PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted. This was during Covid, when the two were ready to tackle a project they could really sink their teeth into. That project being another Slay the Spire was not a given, despite having sold well over a million copies by then. \"We had different paths we could work on,\" Giovanetti said. \"One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on …",

I guess that's technically in Limveld, even though it's an entirely different map.

Unfortunately, as this is part of the Wired Big Interview series, and the larger interview hasn't been published yet, it's hard to fully surmise where Su's stance lies outside of this answer. In its barest form, a bubble is where the asset price in some industry far exceeds actual value, due in part to speculation. The 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble popping didn't mean people wouldn't buy houses or use the internet, but that the value tied up in it exceeded what it was worth, and those betting billions on it could no longer see a return on investment.

A lot of the times I jumped were because I'd clumsily run around a corner too quickly and bumped into an enemy, or a friend had shouted something after being sat in silence for ten minutes. However, the new update coming on Tuesday, December 9, not only adds a haunting new enemy, but an entirely new setting which already gives me the heebie-jeebies. In a trailer uploaded to the Red Barrels YouTube channel , Project Messiah has been revealed. This update plans to take us away from the sterile halls of the Murkoff facility and into what looks like a desolate lodge. Except, unlike a lot of churches I've been into, this one is filled with masked mannequins, statues, and of course—dead bodies. This is The Outlast Trials after all. But among all of the masked mannequins is Liliya Bogomolova, also referred to as Sister Liliya, who is adorned in an almost identical outfit to some of the mannequins. So, I imagine one of our main tasks in the trial wi…",

It even took them a while to come up with a name, but they eventually settled on Nvidia. Yes, that little, independent, underdog company. The one worth $5 trillion back in October. That level of fortune gives one plenty of opportunities to spend hours reminiscing about the past, present, and future, which is precisely what Jensen Huang and Joe Rogan recently did. Specifically, for almost two and a half hours, Huang chatted on the Joe Rogan Experience about all things AI, GPU, CUDA, consciousness, and what have you. There's an awful lot to delve into, but I was particularly drawn to the section where Rogan remarks on Nvidia's massive AI growth and capabilities: \"How funny would it be that it [AI] is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games? It's kind of crazy when you think about it that way.\" This prompted Jensen to start going over Nvidia's beginning, when it was a tiny group of engineers in 1993: \"We were trying to create this new computing approach. The question is, what's the killer app? We wanted to create a new type of computing architecture,…",

That's very counter-intuitive: Steam is far and away the dominant PC storefront, and conventional wisdom states that if you're not there, you're missing out on a major chunk of potential revenue. Witness, for instance, the reaction to the recent ban of Horses on Steam : Yeah, it was also dropped by the Epic Games Store and, for a day, Humble, but Steam is the one that really hurt, and developer Santa Ragione said losing it might force the studio to close. But Hypixel Studios has a very good reason for taking a pass on it: Steam user reviews. \"We want to spend our time in Early Access working with the community and improving the game, rather than overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren't as well-informed yet about what we are doing,\" Hytale executive director Patrick \"Lyall\" Derbic wrote in a new FAQ . \"Steam is a great marketing tool but one that we might never need.

Neither Eidos nor parent company Embracer Group (yes, it's an Embracer studio) have confirmed the layoffs or responded to requests for comment. This would be the second round of layoffs at Eidos Montreal in 2025, following a cut of roughly 75 employees in March .
