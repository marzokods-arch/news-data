    "body": "Bang Si-hyuk , the creative force behind BTS and chairman of K-pop powerhouse HYBE, appeared before the Financial Crimes Investigation Unit of the Korean National Police Agency on Monday (Sept. 15), marking a major development in his first-ever investigation by authorities. Bang is suspected of deceiving investors in 2019 by claiming he had no plans to hold an IPO for HYBE, before allegedly inducing them to sell their shares in the company to a private equity fund associated with him. After HYBE went public, the fund reportedly cashed out. Under a pre-arranged shareholders’ agreement, Bang received 30% of the profits — around 190 billion KRW (approximately $13.7 million) — in what police describe as unjust gains. Bang’s representatives have flatly denied the allegations, insisting that no false information was given to early investors and that the profit-sharing terms were proposed by the investors themselves.

Bluetooth passthrough, which enables Wii Remote support, has been patched to work with more modern Bluetooth adapters. Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

A user with a Pixel 8 Pro running the latest Gboard beta release has received the feature. The feature’s expansion suggests that Google may gradually add more older devices to the list of supported phones. AI features formed some of the Pixel 10 series ‘ core new highlights, one of which was Writing Tools in Gboard . Thanks to its integration into the keyboard app, this tool allows users to use on-device AI to proofread or rephrase their text in any text field. Shortly after the Pixel 10’s launch, Google expanded Gboard Writing Tools to the Pixel 9 series and some new non-Pixel devices. It seems Writing Tools is all set for another expansion, as we’ve now received a report that it is available on a Pixel 8 series phone. Telegram user Mahanadhi Parisara received Writing Tools on their Pixel 8 Pro, running the latest Gboard v15.9.1 beta release.",

This change addresses inconsistent home screens, as many developers currently opt out of providing a themed icon for branding or design reasons. To enforce this, Google updated its Play Store policy today, requiring developers to legally grant users the right to modify their app icon’s color. App icons rarely look similar unless they were designed by the same person or company. This makes them easy to distinguish from one another but can also leave home screens looking messy. To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme. Support for this feature is currently opt-in, and many developers choose not to participate for various reasons. However, thanks to upcoming changes in the Android OS and Google Play, developers will no longer be able to prevent their app icons from being themed. Currently, developers have to supply a monochromatic version of their app icon for Android to theme. This isn’t a huge technical undertaking, but there are sev…",

The change makes it difficult to see the white text in the window. It appears the issue may be connected to the new light theme. About a month ago, some Android Auto users encountered a problem that caused the whole display to look washed out . While the lack of contrast has since been addressed, users are now experiencing a similar but slightly different issue. This issue specifically affects the media player window. Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out. Not only does the lack of contrast look bad, but it also makes it difficult to read any white text in the window. Given that the song title, artist name, and icons are all white, this can be a big problem.",

Unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the 200MP sensor will be used for the OPPO Find X9 Pro’s telephoto camera. The 200MP sensor should allow the OPPO to reduce the number of telephoto cameras on Find X9 Pro to one, as opposed to two on its predecessor. Android phone makers constantly engage in number games to boast improvements over previous generations and as compared to the competition. Phone cameras, with their ever-evolving megapixel counts , especially take center stage in this rivalry, as brands continually vie to outdo one another. Recently, 200MP has been the current gold standard for cameras on flagship Android phones. Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Meanwhile, Vivo has reserved a 200MP sensor for its telephoto camera, and another brand is about to follow suit.",

The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",

Pixels are among the best Android phones you can buy, but they have also earned a notorious reputation for battery troubles. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro now appear to be the latest devices hit by these problems, with owners reporting swelling batteries on Google’s support forums. “I am writing to report a serious issue with my Pixel 7 Pro, which I purchased approximately two years ago. Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk, including the potential for explosion or fire,” a user noted on Google’s support forums . The thread now has several complaints from other Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users who are also experiencing battery swelling issues on their devices.",

Apple made some really interesting upgrades to the Pro series this year. The new design with the Google Pixel-inspired camera bar is a bold choice, the new telephoto sensor sounds promising, and the A19 Pro paired with a vapor chamber should make the iPhone 17 Pro a performance powerhouse.",

It’s called Glyphify , and it adds a few new tricks to my Nothing Phone 3 and even more flexibility to Nothing’s older launches. Let’s check it out.",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

Early adopters include fintech companies like Klarna and OnePay, which are adding mobile service to their financial apps. Unlike most prepaid brands, Gigs-powered services can openly advertise that they run on AT&amp;T’s network. Carriers are increasingly making it easier for independent companies to launch their own wireless brands. Last year, T-Mobile unveiled “ Your Name, Our Wireless ,” a program where virtually any business can set up its own carrier, with T-Mobile doing most of the heavy lifting. Now AT&amp;T is taking a similar step, though with a few twists. Instead of running everything directly, AT&amp;T is working with Gigs, a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) that provides the back-end tools needed for others to create and manage prepaid services on AT&amp;T’s network. Another big difference is that Gigs OS is designed for tech companies that want to integrate connectivity into existing apps and services, rather than for companies aiming to launch stand-alone prepaid brand…",

Wear OS 6 is the latest iteration of the software and is based on Android 16. Wear OS 6 users who already had the old Weather app before upgrading can continue using it, but new downloads from the Play Store will no longer be allowed. Pixel Watch users will get upgraded to the Pixel Weather app. Google will no longer offer its Weather app for new installations on Wear OS 6 and newer smartwatches. Instead, users are encouraged to download other third-party weather apps for Wear OS or use the default weather apps offered by watch brands.",

    "summary": "From new triggers to one-time automations, there's a lot changing with this editor overhaul.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google Home is rolling out a new automation editor experience on Android and iOS. The editor supports conditions, adds new actions and triggers, and just empowers more complicated automations. While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",
