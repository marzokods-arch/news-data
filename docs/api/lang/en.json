And along the way, it's become one of the premier publishers of games for arch-sickos: Its catalog includes acclaimed story simulators like Six Ages, hyperdense procgen sandboxes like noir space-sim Ostranauts, MoMA-featured masterwork Dwarf Fortress, and Hugo Award-winning roguelike fever dream Caves of Qud.

And now Blizzard has turned its attention back towards them as Diablo 4's second expansion is on the horizon. Diablo 4's two methods of crafting—if you can call them that—stick out as features that solved necessary problems at the time, but are now more of a nuisance than anything. Blizzard added tempering and masterworking to keep loot from feeling static. Both systems give any piece of gear the potential to be an upgrade by letting you customize what stats are on them and how powerful they are. The problem is that both of them are based purely on luck. Let me tell you, spamming an upgrade button to see if you got the right result is not particularly fun, especially when you're doing it for every piece of gear you own. It's even worse when it's …",

Beginning at a space station crammed with astronauts, up to four players can embark on missions together, visiting a weirdo planet for some co-op chaos that includes completing objectives, battling alien lifeforms, and collecting \"space loot.\" You can glide across colorful landscapes, swim through alien oceans, and have encounters with everything from monstrous extraterrestrial brutes to harmless sentient carrots. Your tools let you deform the alien planet, too: tunneling through the ground, building land bridges to cross gaps, and aiming water nozzles to \"de-goop\" important scientific equipment that the local fauna has gummed up. When a mission has been completed, you return to the space station and prepare for the next expedition. That all looks like a good time, but where I'm a bit iffy on Starseeker is that every mission is on a timer. \"The clock starts ticking the second you step out of your landing shuttle,\" says S…",

We haven't previously known the release date for the fourth season of Netflix's best-known monster-killing show, so that's probably the real headline news here. For me, though, the real eye-catcher is Laurence Fishburne's big hair. That is a look. (Image credit: Netflix) Fishburne is playing Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy—just Regis to his friends—in Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher, a higher vampire who joins Geralt and company on their quest to track down Ciri. Regis also played a pivotal role in The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion, and to be fair he had a pretty wild 'do in that one too. (Image credit: CD Projekt) We also get a very brief glimpse at what I'm pretty sure is Danny Woodburn as Zoltan Chivay, another of Geralt's stalwart companions. Also some undeniably phenomenal hair going on there. (Image credit: Netflix) The rest of the gang is here, and there's plenty of violence to enjoy, being dished out not just by Geralt but also Yennefer and Ciri, both of whom have become very handy in a fight.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the news in Stockholm, Sweden. Professor John Clarke, Professor Michel H. Devoret and Professor John M. Martinis are the new Nobel laureates. Clarke is from the UK and now works at the University of California in Berkeley; Devoret is from Paris, France and works at Yale; Martinis is American and works at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

I've been on multiple trains in the past year and I've only rarely had to open fire on anyone. So I was sceptical leading up to my hands-on time with Red Rover Interactive's Enginefall, which is in essence a Dune: Awakening-ish take on Snowpiercer . I might still be a little sceptical, but I see the vision now. Romping about the game's carriages with ad-hoc armaments, getting the drop on other players, and seeing the ruined world zip by out the window: it works better than it maybe should, and provides ample space for you and other players to gin up temporary, make-do alliances that you betray the nanosecond it becomes profitable.

And it's not just me: Bungie's recent moves have done nothing to stop players from leaving, at least if Steam's data is considered representative of the playerbase at large. Yesterday, Destiny 2 posted its lowest daily peak concurrent player count in the game's history—16,067 players. That 'beats' the previous low of 18,023 back in the doldrums of Revenant—the last expansion cycle's worst episode. It's worth remembering that peak daily concurrents offer us a very limited picture: The number of players simultaneously in-game during Destiny 2's busiest period. It doesn't tell us how many players actually logged into the game over the course of the day. Nor does it tell us what the game's population is on other platforms.

George and French journalist Nico Collard say goodbye to Paris and Templar conspiracies and instead find themselves in South America uncovering a Mayan mystery. George really doesn't know how to take a normal holiday. This updated version will feature 4K art and the return of Broken Sword 1's story mode—a more relaxed mode that gives you a bit of assistance with puzzles, while not feeding you the solution. \"The Smoking Mirror has always been one of our most loved games, and with Reforged we were able to enhance it in ways that respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences\", says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. \"Just as with the first game, we can't wait for players old and new to experience it again.\" I truly adore the Broken Sword series and thought the remaster was pretty much perfect , aside from the slightly tinny audio.

That's not to say I'm calling it here and now that it'll be perfect. It's developer Epictellers Entertainment's first ever game; CRPGs are hard to make; and it's still very, very early days. Starfinder: Afterlight is the first proper videogame to use Starfinder 2e—built upon Pathfinder 2e's framework. So far, Afterlight's developers have been a tad coy.

I think the folks at Epictellers are being a little gunshy. What I saw wasn't terrible at all—the environment, a space cantina bar with flickering neon signs, looks pretty and well-detailed.

Great news for you, dear reader, less so me moving around my small, now very cramped, office. While I am a fan of the white HS 420, the black version is the better-looking of the BF 360 options. That's mostly down to the front panel. Both versions come with speckled, textured front panels—the thing that lured me to these cases when they were first displayed on the Computex showfloor—but the lighter panel looks a lot better in contrast to the black shell. The Havn style introduced with the HS 420 is still going strong with the BF 360. A style that's very appealing to me, personally, with rounded corners and long vents for increased airflow through the front and top panels and down the rear of the chassis. Havn has even handed me a diagram of all the various prototypes it worked through for where it put the supports for these vents and how it landed on the final design for …",

It's intriguing for one or two other reasons, too. But let's start with that eye-popping 1,600 brightness rating. This is a mini LED monitor, not an OLED panel and it comes with a VESA DisplayHDR 1400 rating. That means it must be capable of hitting 1,400 nits, full screen. By contrast, pun intended, the brightest OLED monitors are currently rated at 1,300 nits, like the LG Ultragear 45GX950A , but can only achieve that in tiny windows measuring a percentage or two of the whole screen. In other words, OLED can only hit those kinds of numbers for very small highlights, with full screen brightness only recently breaking the 300 nit barrier. But this TCL display can do 1,400 nits full screen. It's not clear whether the 1,600 nit spec TCL claims is sustained full-screen brightness or limited by aperture or time.

It's a feat that most had deemed impossible, but Battlefield Studios will hopefully pull it off regardless, thanks in no small part to its use of community feedback. Now I will say that my usual response to developers championing community feedback is for my eyes to roll into the back of my head as I tick it off my bingo card of cliché dev phrases, but in this case, it really does seem like Battlefield Labs has had a major impact on Battlefield 6's development. (Image credit: EA) Battlefield Labs is BF Studios' most exclusive club, a public-facing playtest that only the most avid fans get invited to. \"Developing on a live game, you can easily get players' feedback,\" says lead producer Nika Bender in an interview cover feature for our Print Magazine . \"Battlefield Labs is our way of getting players' feedback during development time, while we can still address it. This means that by the time the game is out there, it includes player feedback, and we give players what they want.\" Many deve…",

I figured this would always be the way, and I'd actively avoid any game that involves me wielding a firearm for the foreseeable future, until the fateful day I saw Don't Stop, Girlypop! on Steam . You could colour any game with various hues and douse it in virtual glitter and heart icons, and it would probably pique my interest in some way or another. Lucky for me, Don't Stop, Girlypop! feeds this insatiable need for all things cute and pink while disguised as an action-packed arena shooter, resulting in me feeling brave enough to actually pick up a game from the genre I've sworn to dislike.

That perception dramatically changed, I reckon, around the time of massively multiplayer Curiosity: What's Inside The Cube . It was a game in which, well, a lot of players all tapped on a cube, removing layer after layer until they eventually hit the centre. Molyneux promised the prize for the single player who reached that centre would be \"life-changing\". It turned out to be the role of 'God of gods' in Molyneux's then-upcoming game Godus, plus 1% of the game's revenue. The winner—an 18-year-old named Bryan Henderson—never got any money, and told Eurogamer that he was largely forgotten by Molyneux's studio after a single visit to its office in 2015. Fast forward to today, and an interview with the most recent issue of Edge magazine, and Molyneux seems contrite about the whole saga, but I don't know that he's learnt the right lessons.

It is only these \"X\" branded chips that will reportedly get Panther Lake's most powerful Xe3 integrated graphics. The full-spec Panther Lake models, therefore, will reportedly be configured with four Performance cores and eight Efficient cores in the CPU chiplet. They will be complemented by a further four Efficient cores in the so-called low-power island on the SoC die for a grand total of 16 CPU cores. According to this new leak, this new upper tier of Panther Lake chips will be branded Intel Core Ultra X300. So, by way of example, the top chip is said to be the Intel Core Ultra 9 X388H. Arguably the most exciting element of the new chip for PC gaming, however, is the new Xe3-spec iGPU, also known as Celestial. The new \"X\" branded models reportedly get 12 graphics cores.

When it feels like it's drawing to an end it just keeps going , and its protracted runtime is exacerbated by the fact that it's an unbearably tense experience. I adore this game, I swear I do, but boy could it have used a trim. It turns out at least one member of the original dev team agrees. In a conversation with FRVR , Alien Isolation writer Dion Lay demonstrates that the outsize length of the game wasn't deliberate at all: it was because the Xenomorph AI got way too good. In Alien Isolation, the Xenomorph has more sophisticated AI than is still the norm in horror games. Whereas the indestructible stalking characters in Resident Evil tend to always behave the same, the Xenomorph can adapt to player behaviour and is thus a far more formidable opponent. It's why Alien Isolation is still unmatched when it comes to cat-and-mouse style horror, but it also serves to make the player behave more carefully and thus, slowly. In other words: a story that unfolded at a faster clip with less-sophisticated AI became much longer. “The Alien really evolved as we were making it,” Lay said.…",

It's Jurassic Park simulator, in other words, where you try to complete objectives and escape the facility while the deadly T-Rex, the imposing allosaurus, those devious little compsognathus (compies), and of course, the fearsome raptors are nipping at your heels. (Or more accurately, are trying to chew you up and swallow you.) I'm not sure why, but at some point I started assuming Deathground was a bit like Dead By Daylight, and that in addition to playing as humans trying to survive the facility, players could also take on the role of one of the dinosaurs for a bit of asynchronous PvP. I'm not alone in that misconception: it's apparently come up so often that the developers of Deathground put out a FAQ video before the game's early access launch Tuesday to dispel that myth. One of the first questions in the video is \"Can I play as a dinosaur?\" And the answer, unequivocally, is no. \"Deathground is PvE, or player versus environment, so …",

The double XP party is now on until the Blops 7 beta finally concludes on October 9, which just happens to be 24 hours before the global launch of Battlefield 6. Is it a coincidence that the two games keep intersecting like this? I mean yeah, probably—it's a packed fall calendar and you gotta hold your betas sometime—but the short turnaround continues to make these dueling military FPS giants interesting to compare. Take the betas themselves: Battlefield 6 surprised everyone when its open beta peaked at over 500,000 players on Steam alone , marking the \"biggest Battlefield beta ever\" for EA. Activision seems happy with the response to the Black Ops 7 beta so far, but Call of Duty's Steam concurrents didn't crest 100,000 as the beta opened up to everybody on Sunday.

It requires nothing but some precise movement and zero shame for abusing what is a pretty ridiculous glitch. Spoilers below for the second-to-last boss of act 2. Kilroy calls the trick an \"upslash AI break,\" and all it involves is swiping upward with Hornet's needle over and over until you win. For reasons that only Team Cherry would know, this is how you can easily defeat Lace in the second encounter with her near the end of the game. She will simply stand there and take each hit until it's basically over. You won't need any particular crest or tool equipped. Kilroy says the only fiddly part is nudging yourself up just close enough to Lace that you don't take damage. Lace won't move away once you've locked her in place and then all you need to do is quickly line yourself back up when she eventually gets knocked backward …",

It's good news all around, unless you're one of the many Battlefield 6 beta players who didn't like its new \"Open Weapons\" default—a ruleset that lets any class use any weapon a la Call of Duty. A good chunk of today's blog was a post-mortem on player behavior in the open beta—the result of exactly 92,351,578 total hours played. When comparing Open vs. Closed playlists, DICE says class pick rates were \"mostly identical\" and Closed Weapon (AKA class-locked weapons) matches went on just a tad longer on average, which led to a 2-3% increase in revives. As for weapon usage, \"more players played with non-signature weapons in Open Weapon playlists. However, Recon players still favored Sniper Rifles over other weapons, and their pick rate was identical between both playlist types.\" That lines up with my experience. With open weapons, engineers tended to ditch their signature SMGs for the generally superior…",

The game that seems to worry Activision, though? Going by the chat function in Black Ops 7, it's Arc Raiders (due out on October 30). The words \"Arc Raiders\" are censored in Black Ops 7 chat. PCG's Elie Gould tested it out, and when you try to type those words you just get a load of asterisks. Neither \"Arc\" nor \"Raiders\" is picked up like this, only the two words together. Now, there is one kink worth considering here before we all get the pitchforks out. Several months ago users reported a similar problem in the EA App chat . First of all it's surprising that anyone used chat in the EA App, but the situation here was exactly the same. Once this was noticed EA seemed to move quickly to correct the situation, and players could happily chat about Arc Raiders on the EA App from 6 August.

So, it's not a huge surprise to find a former senior Intel manager describing morale as being \"in the toilet.\" But it hits hard, all the same. A new feature on Fortune.com outlines Intel's current problems and provides a glimpse of the huge effort it's going to take to truly turn things around. Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges involves staff, both inside and outside the company. On the one hand, staff inside Intel are said to be demoralised. It's a, “heads-down, push-through situation. That spark in people’s eyes, the desire to do this work, was not there,” said the same former Intel insider of the company's recent predicament. At the same time, attracting new talent to what's seen as a sinking ship is going to be extremely difficult. Intel is no longer the top destination for the \"brightest minds\" in engineering. \"Most people want to be part of a growth story, not a turnaround story,\" another former senior Intel manager is quoted as saying. Fortune notes that Intel's latest CEO Lip Bu Tan has touted new engineering hires as evidence of the progress being made. But that reportedly hasn't landed well inside …",

According to retired Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell (via Earthlink ), roughly two Starlink satellites are burning up in the Earth's atmosphere every day. And that's set to go up. If that all sounds pretty alarming, it's not necessarily a disaster. In fact, it's probably the plan. At the latest count, Starlink has about 8,500 of its low Earth orbit (LEO) comms satellites up there in the inky blackness. Now, because Starlink satellites are in such low orbit, they experience significant drag from the Earth's upper atmosphere. That means the satellites need regular injections of velocity-increasing thrust to stay in orbit. As we'll see in a moment, this is probably a good thing. But one consequence is that the satellites can only stay aloft for a limited period, around five years. Starlink has plans for anywhere from 12,000 to over 40,000 satellites in the long haul.
