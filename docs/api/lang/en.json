    "body": "TL;DR Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users are reporting battery swelling issues, with mixed responses from Google support. Google recently offered free battery replacements and cash/discount appeasements for Pixel 7a swelling problems. Battery troubles have plagued several Pixel models, including Pixel 6a units catching fire, raising pressure on Google to respond. Pixels are among the best Android phones you can buy, but they have also earned a notorious reputation for battery troubles. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro now appear to be the latest devices hit by these problems, with owners reporting swelling batteries on Google’s support forums. “I am writing to report a serious issue with my Pixel 7 Pro, which I purchased approximately two years ago. Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk, including the potential for explosion or fire,” a user noted on Google’s support forums . The thread now has several complaints from other Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users who are also experiencing battery swelling issues on their devices.",

Apple made some really interesting upgrades to the Pro series this year. The new design with the Google Pixel-inspired camera bar is a bold choice, the new telephoto sensor sounds promising, and the A19 Pro paired with a vapor chamber should make the iPhone 17 Pro a performance powerhouse.",

There is no other way to say this, but the degradation in color quality and science was so palpable since the Pixel 6, culminating in the washed-out photos of the Pixel 9 Pro . Even me, a staunch Pixel camera fan, had somewhat given up on getting good, lively photos from my phone last year. Every time I snapped a picture, especially in a colorful environment or a warm indoor, the result came up dull and boring. I say this because I know what the Pixel’s camera was capable of in previous generations and because I’ve been testing the new Pixel 10 Pro XL against the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The results? They’re not even funny. Nearly everything I complained about with the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera has been fixed on the 10 Pro, which makes me equally happy and angry. See for yourself.",

In fact, I’d say that Nova Launcher has been the go-to app for Android customization for well over a decade. It earned that well-deserved status by giving users more control than stock launchers ever could, from how icons looked to how gestures worked to how the app drawer was laid out. But all good things come to an end, and the development of the app has drawn to a close. Anyone following the industry would’ve seen the writing on the wall when the app got taken over by Branch Metrics a while back. All that to say that updates and future compatibility remain unlikely. And if you haven’t been keeping up with alternate launchers for a while now — I know I haven’t — well, it’s time to start planning for what comes next. The good news is that Android’s launcher scene has grown rich and varied, and I’ve spent time testing and revisiting a wide range of options that will appeal to you not only if you’re looking for a Nova alternative, but also if you want to try something fresh. These are seven of my favorite Nova Launcher alternatives that stand out right now.",

As for the validity of this emulator, the Eden team has now confirmed on Discord that the Play Store listing is “legitimate, and fully owned and published by us.” However, it contains an older version of the app, with the latest v0.0.3 update from last Friday awaiting approval from Google.",

I see that new front-facing camera, and I know many Android brands are now scrambling to copy it in 2026; it’ll easily be the new gold standard of selfie cameras. But if there was one thing that stood out to me more than the silly thinness of the Air and its external battery pack, the misleading “fusion” lens, the 120Hz refresh rate on the base iPhone, and the new modems and chips, it’s one tiny detail: The iPhone 17 now starts at 256GB .",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

Google is even previewing controls for more smart devices in the Home web app. However, not all is well with the platform and Google’s latest phones, as Pixel 10 users have complained about missing Google Home notifications on their devices. Thankfully, Google has confirmed it’s working on a solution. Reddit user GreyFoxSolid said they weren’t receiving Google Home notifications on their new Pixel 10 Pro XL. Several others also reported the same issue, with some users getting notifications on their Pixel Watch but not their phone.",

We’ve spotted a filter to include and exclude shared photos in the search results Currently, users have to save shared photos to their accounts before they can be searched. Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others. There is one caveat, though: You cannot search for anything in the images that others share with you, at least from what we can gather. Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users. Google has been working to fix that by directly opening up the ability to search for photos from albums shared with you on Google Photos.

The editor supports conditions, adds new actions and triggers, and just empowers more complicated automations. While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand.

A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 series comes with a toggle to turn off PWM dimming, a method that lowers the display’s brightness by strobing it in short intervals. PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced. All iPhone 17 models reportedly come with a hidden setting to toggle PWM (pulse-width modulation) on or off. The setting is supposedly buried among Accessibility options in iOS 26 release cand…",
