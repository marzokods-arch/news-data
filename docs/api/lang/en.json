Its cinematic take on World War II, and especially the Omaha Beach landing, earned it our Best Action Game of the Year award, and made it one of 2002's must-play games. The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing. Or, to put it another way, \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" as Zampella recently told GQ Magazine . It's an incredible own-goal in the history of video‚Ä¶",

It's working so far: Whether I'm driver, gunner, or a humble passenger, at least half of my tank and jeep escapades have ended with the sudden and frankly terrifying boom of a land mine.

It's hard to imagine that being gripping, which is probably why the stealth sequences in Netflix's animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch don't last all that long before transitioning into straight action.

Multiplayer horror has always had a foothold amongst the subgenres' finest, but after Phasmo's release five years ago, the scene has totally exploded with more horror games, both intense single-player experiences and wacky multiplayer romps. Part of this was certainly thanks to other factors, such as the pandemic keeping people inside, meaning that many were looking for new ways to hang out with friends, but it's safe to say that Phasmo's success spurred on the appetite for co-op games we've seen recently, like Lethal Company or REPO . (Image credit: Kinetic Games) You'd think that Phasmo's creator, Daniel Knight, would want to keep some of that success to himself, but that's just not the case. \"There's definitely some games out there that have taken a lot of inspiration from Phasmo,\" Knight tells me. \"But the reason why I made the game was because nothing like it existed, and I wanted to play that game. So now that there are all these other games out there, the same as Phasmo, it's just really good to see. Because at the time, there was nothing, now there's obviously quite a lot.\" Knight has said‚Ä¶",

It's job is to help simplify, improve compatibility for, and increase the capabilities of x86. Now, exactly one year on, AMD and Intel are letting us know the fruits of this perhaps peculiar collaboration. Those fruits, outlined by AMD , read a little like elvish to my weary eyes, but the general gist seems to be that there have been four big improvements made, in the form of new standards for upcoming Intel and AMD chips. Those four areas are the development of Advanced Matrix Extension (ACE), AVX10, Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED), and ChkTag. The latter two should improve CPU interrupt security and performance as well as memory safety. The last point is particularly relevant because Arm already has memory tagging for memory safety, so ChkTag will be x86 catching up in this regard. AVX10 will be the latest iteration of x86's AVX SIMD instructions, which should improve vector performance. Then there's ACE, about which AMD says: \"Accepted and implemented across the stack, ACE standardizes matrix multiplication capabilities, enabling seaml‚Ä¶",

Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times, especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas. It's an issue almost everywhere, but it plagues maps like Operation Firestorm and Liberation Peak, where the contrast is even greater. Thankfully, I can put down my sunglasses, as there is actually a bandaid solution hidden in the game's menus.

Although every other mainline Splinter Cell game has been easy to pick up on PC digital storefronts for years, Pandora Tomorrow has always been strangely and sadly absent from the Ubi digital lineup. The corp wasn't just playing favourites‚Äîit wasn't available on Ubisoft Connect (n√©e Uplay) either. That may be because Pandora Tomorrow's PC version was a bit busted (which is saying something for this series on PC: Double Agent will subject you to a gamut of errors and crashes if you dare try to run it). The game would run rife with graphical errors on more recent GPUs, and it's possible Ubi felt it was more trouble than it was worth to fix it up before selling it.

Completing odd and often challenging tasks has always been one of the highlights of the series for me, but Battlefield 6's assignments are very grindy, and there are a good few that are very hard to complete by yourself. The biggest issue right now, however, is that it's a Sisyphean task: there's a prevalent bug preventing assignments tracking whatsoever for some players, or not tracking accurately in other cases. Healing 5,000 damage from teammates or getting kills while buffed by a stim is one thing, but when none of it is counted and you're not making any progress at all, it's a frustrating mess. That's not to mention that some of the assignment descriptions are actually incorrect. For example, the Rapid Fire assignment to unlock additional assault rifles tasks ‚Ä¶",

There'll be plenty of different player-made templates for you to pick from, but I recommend Rush or Breakthrough on hardcore mode because these funnel bots into smaller areas and you can kill them faster.

If that describes you, then I have something positively titillating for you: a fully ceramic keyboard from Keychron.

This includes getting hands-on with the brand new Spear weapon, alongside a new weapon enchantment we haven't heard about yet: the Lunge. Details on the lunge enchantment for the spear have been shared in an official blog post about the update. This enchantment gives you a burst of speed when using the weapon, which you can take advantage of in combat to deliver hits to any mobs that might be challenging to fight with a sword. But, you can also use the enchantment to travel around the overworld a lot faster, which is bound to save your hunger from rapidly depleting if you run around on foot. Other features available to test in this snapshot include the Nautilus, which you will now be able to go and tame and ride around the ocean, alongside the Zombie Nautilus which we now know is tameable. We knew that this mob would have a zombified version, but the fact you can actually keep one for yourself is exciting. Similarly, you'll also be able to go ‚Ä¶",

For many players, WoW Legion Remix is an opportunity to collect achievements and cosmetics they previously missed‚Äîor the new ones Blizzard added on top. Many of them require completing raids and dungeons that take full groups, but finding parties has proven to be a problem in the early stage of the event. Weirdly enough, players are running into completely the opposite problem you'd expect if this was the regular version of WoW: Tanks, out of all three available roles, are the overwhelming majority. That's because, as you gain more and more gear upgrades, characters dedicated to healing or pure damage-dealing aren't really needed. Unfortunately, this leaves behind all the players who haven't had the time to grind themselves into godhood.

In order to fix the most egregious issues and to keep the game stable, game director Mikael Erikkson says major new updates will be a little slower to appear. \"We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in,\" Erikkson explains. \"And also we want to make sure that we update the game in ways that are more stable, in ways that are noticeable for players with every new update that we do.\" Erikkson says some of the issues can be addressed \"fairly quickly,\" but that other things will take more time. \"We're already making really big improvements,\" he says, and details on what those are will be discussed soon.

Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions.

Now, I'll admit, the SCW-10 might be the worst-looking gun at first sight, owing in large part to its very small frame, low precision stat, and measly 15 bullets in a magazine. The thing is, these don't matter once you've actually seen the gun in action. Boasting higher ‚Ä¶",

    "body": "I've been impressed by Fellowship ever since I first got my hands on it last year . The pitch for the game is one I'm surprised nobody ever thought of: MMO dungeons without the MMO. Imagine a typical MMO party‚Äîone healer, one tank, and some damage-dealers‚Äîand then give them names and characteristics that resemble MOBA heroes. That's Fellowship, a hero-based co-op RPG where parties of four clear through increasingly difficult dungeons and collect loot. Fellowship is the fun of grouping up with your buddies (or randos) and seeing if you can coordinate well enough to overcome bosses with room-filling attacks. There's nothing more thrilling than wearing down a big health bar and barely squeezing out a victory because everyone was able to maximize their role in the fight. And that's just the boss fights. There are tons of strategies for how to work through the packs of enemies efficiently that you'll need to adapt to as the challenge increases. After a handful of betas, Fellowship is launching in early access on Steam this week. Developer Chief Rebel dropped a trailer showcasing its Blizzard-like art style and some of the bosses you'll encounter, like a giant monster made out of gold c‚Ä¶",

    "body": "There's no shortage of strong SMGs in Battlefield 6 . In fact, it's generally the most consistent weapon type at close and medium range (way further out than they should be, really), almost invalidating assault rifles. While that's not quite where the best SCW-10 loadout shines, its bafflingly fast TTK will have you feeling bad for your enemies. Unlike most of the best guns in Battlefield 6, the SCW-10 is locked behind an assignment, specifically, the Close Quarters 1 assignment. Most assignments are pretty horrible, but this one isn't too bad (just a bit of a grind), requiring you to get 300 close-quarter kills with SMGs and inflict 10,000 damage while aiming with SMGs. Best SCW-10 loadout in Battlefield 6 (Image credit: EA) I recommend the following attachments for my SCW-10 build: Muzzle: Single-Port Brake (10) Barrel: Light 6.8\" Fluted (20) Magazine: 20 RND Magazine (20) Ammunition: Hollow Point (20) Scope: Mini Flex 1.00x (10) Accessory: 50MW Green (20) While it can stay oddly competitive at mid-range like most SMGs, the SCW-10 is undeniably a close-quarters weapon. With that in mind, there's little to be gained by improving recoil control or ADS accuracy. The main attachment‚Ä¶",
