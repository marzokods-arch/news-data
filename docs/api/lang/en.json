The couple got married on Saturday (Sept. 27) in California, with Gomez confirming the happy news with a same-day look at some romantic wedding photos and video clips. The pop star and Only Murders in the Building actress posted a sweet wedding album on Instagram Saturday evening, crediting photographer/artist Petra Collins by tagging her on the images. (Petra also tagged her sister Anna Collins in an Instagram Story sharing footage from the wedding.) The pictures focus on the bride and groom embracing, and they share a glimpse at wedding-day details &#8212; like Gomez&#8217;s custom halter-style dress by Ralph Lauren , her bridal bouquet, and the celebration&#8217;s private estate setting. A short video captures an intimate moment in which Gomez fixes Blanco&#8217;s bowtie and puts her hands on his face, just before the lovebirds share a sweet kiss. Gomez wrote a simple, classy caption to commemorate their wedding day: &#8220;9.27.25.&#8221; She surrounded the date with white heart emojis. &#8220;my wife in real life,&#8221; Blanco commented on her post.

The incident happened a day after the 24-year-old south London singer&#8217;s Friday night gig was canceled by her team &#8220;due to a sensitive matter.&#8221; Young gave a strong vocal performance but appeared flushed and emotional during her set Saturday at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, powering through four songs — “Spiders,” “F&#8212; Everyone,” “Dealer” and “Walk All Over You,” all from her new album I&#8217;m Only F&#8212;ing Myself — before falling backwards during the next. Midway through 2023 single “Conceited,” Young paused to communicate with her keyboardist. The message did not appear to get across before she suddenly collapsed. Young’s band, team and security rushed to surround the singer, who was down for about 30-45 seconds, and carried her offstage .

    "body": "A 10-foot statue of rock n’ roll queen Tina Turner was unveiled Saturday (Sept. 27) in the rural Tennessee community where she grew up — before becoming a Grammy-winning singer, an electrifying stage performer, and one the world’s most recognizable and popular entertainers. The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands. The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the “mane of a lion.” Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs “Nutbush City Limits,” “Proud Mary,” “Private Dancer,” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” from the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.”…",

In the 12-second clip shared to Instagram , Wallen appears in a war-torn setting, sporting a backward baseball cap and a green long-sleeve shirt while wielding an intimidatingly large automatic rifle. &#8220;For the bad guys out there,&#8221; Wallen says as he cocks his weapon. &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m the problem.&#8221; The line is a direct nod to Wallen’s latest album, I’m the Problem , which spent 12 nonconsecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 following its release in May 2025. The teaser ends with a message revealing that the full live-action trailer for Battlefield 6 will drop Sunday (Sept. 28). Wallen isn&#8217;t the only celebrity joining the Battlefield 6 campaign.

The Harlow Shapley Visiting Lectureship Program, named for astronomer Harlow Shapley (1885-1972), has a history dating back to the 1950s, when it provided support for a scientist to give a series of astronomy-themed lectures at a college or university, coupled with a public talk to the local community. In 2024, AAS partnered with NCCN to broaden the impact of the Shapley lectureship program to community colleges, making use of NCCN’s existing network of 260 college instructors across 44 states and 120 participating Subject Matter Experts (SME) to “matchmake” community colleges with astronomers. NCCN has supported the teaching of astronomy …",

The technology startup headquartered in Hawthorne, California, won second place overall at the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge’s live demonstration and finale in June 2024. This competition, one of NASA’s Centennial Challenges, tasked competitors to design, build, and demonstrate robotic technologies that could excavate and transport the icy, rocky dirt – otherwise known as regolith – found on the Moon. Starpath team members (foreground: Josh Kavilaveettil, mechanical engineer; background: Aakash Ramachandran, lead rover engineer) put their upgraded lunar regolith rover to the test inside NASA Marshall’s 20-foot thermal vacuum chamber – a prize opportunity marking one year since their 2nd place win in the Break the Ice Lunar Challenge.

Detailed Background Document Overview: What is an Uncrewed Aircraft System?&nbsp; An uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) can be defined as an aircraft without an operator or flight crew onboard the aircraft itself. UAS are remotely controlled using manual flight controls (i.e., teleoperation) or autonomously operated using uploaded control parameters (e.g., waypoints, altitude hold, or minimum/maximum airspeed for example).&nbsp; UAS are typically used to perform a variety of tasks or applications that are considered too dull, dangerous, dirty, or deep for humans or crewed platforms (also known as the “4Ds”). Their civilian/commercial uses include aerial photography/filming, agriculture, communications, conservation/wildlife monitoring, damage assessment/infrastructure inspection, fire services and forestry support, law enforcement/security, search and rescue, weather monitoring and research.

It has been increasingly important to strategically improve the agricultural industry to continue to provide for communities. Agriculture faces many challenges such as production delays, pests and disease, weather and climate impacts, and financial sustainability of the agricultural industry itself. To battle these challenges, the agriculture industry must adapt and grow innovatively by embracing new technology to become more resilient and more efficient. &nbsp; NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) focuses on integrating drones into the US national airspace system (NAS), with a focus on creating a system that is accessible, safe, and affordable.

This annual event offers an opportunity for earthlings to celebrate the inspiring bond between Earth and the Moon, and, this year, to share in the excitement of NASA’s preparations for Artemis II. Launching in early 2026, the mission will send four astronauts on a nearly 10-day flight past the Moon and back. On Saturday, the Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase, with most of its face lit up by the Sun. Given these lighting conditions, viewers will be able to see many interesting sites with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes — depending on local weather. Moon observers will see large, dark patches on the Moon called “maria,” or “seas” in Latin.
