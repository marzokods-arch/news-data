Yes, it actually makes two of our top three best SSDs for gaming , though it's not as obvious today as one might expect. Essentially, SSDs under the WD branding are actually owned by Sandisk. The two companies used to be one and the same—with Sandisk a subsidiary of WD. However, WD decided to separate from Sandisk ; WD would focus on the lucrative HDD business and Sandisk would become its own entity focused on SSDs. The split happened in February last year. It all went off without a hitch; the only problem being the branding. Sandisk, now independent from WD, had the company's name on most of its best products. Today, that all changes. Sandisk is rolling out the 'Optimus' brand, which includes three tiers: Sandisk Optimus Sandisk Optimus GX Sandisk Optimus GX Pro Yeah, heavy use of the letter X and the word 'Pro'; nothing out of the ordinary for a tech brand here.

Asus reports the glasses can cover 95% of the \"human focus area\" with its 57-degree field of view. The one spec that gives me pause here is the FHD resolution (aka 1080p). With a screen being so close to your eyes and intended to give such a huge screen digital experience, this feels very low given how large the virtual screen will be. Still, the display is impressive, with the Xreal R1 AR being the first 240 Hz gaming glasses. A Micro-OLED screen should look mighty impressive, but font fringing is a worry on OLED panels, especially at lower resolutions. These are designed as gaming glasses, so that should be less of a worry, but it's certainly something I'd consider if I wanted to use them in a productivity capacity too.

At launch, that math held true. In three days, Monster Hunter Wilds had sold a triumphant 8 million copies—the fastest-selling launch in Capcom's history. 10 months later, the story of Monster Hunter Wilds has a very different tone. On Steam, its review rating hangs at a middling Mixed, having intermittently plunged to Mostly Negative when updates either neglect or worsen the game's profound performance issues. By July, its sales had collapsed—and after news broke that it had gone from 10 million launch sales to less than 500,000 in a quarter, Capcom's stock price plummeted alongside.

Regardless, here's one more bit of evidence for the 'Howard doesn't hate Obsidian' pile: in a chat with Game Informer (via GamesRadar ), Howard said that, when it came to a non-Bethesda studio making a Fallout game, it was Obsidian or bust. \"They were the only choice,\" said Howard. \"They had done something similar with Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well.\" In 2004, Obsidian put out Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2—a follow-up to BioWare's KOTOR 1 that more than a few people (myself included) came to regard as their favourite of the two games, and that despite the fact Obsidian had barely over a year to make the whole thing.

Two: anime melodrama. If you love characters scream-crying through their emotional beats more than reading FromSoft flavor text like \"If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?\" , this action RPG holds great potential for you. I can't say that the anime Dark Souls angle grabbed me in the three hours or so I spent playing it at a preview event in December, but Code Vein 2 is also, depending on how you choose to play it, Dark Souls But You Have a Gun. Now that's got some pull. It feels like wielding a forbidden instrument. Illicit. I'm harnessing a power typically reserved for comedic punctuation. Do I just think that because I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark at a young age and instantly formed a new personality the moment Indiana Jones Smith & Wesson'd that sword guy into oblivion?

The DLC is split into levels in which you need to find clues and solve puzzles, but its open-world nature means you can explore at your own pace too. You're able to venture through Mirkwood forest, the Starcourt Mall, and even throw yourself into the Upside Down if you're feeling brave. It's actually scarier than the Nether, especially when you've got a pack of demogorgons on your tail. As you make your way around the world and solve the various puzzles tucked away, the world will \"evolve\" to give you new areas to explore as well. To coincide with the setting, most of Stranger Things' iconic characters are available to play as too, and each comes with unique abilities to help you make your way through Hawkins.

The game got a poor reception, including from us. Steven Messner scored the game 55% in his Anthem review and called it \"deeply flawed and frequently frustrating,\" though very pretty indeed (I am often described the same way). BioWare pledged to \"reinvent\" the game around a year after release until another year later in 2021, when EA execs said 'Actually, hold that thought', and cancelled development entirely. Despite all that, the game's servers have been up and running for all that time; the world's slim supply of Anthem-heads have been able to get their fill for years. But it's all about to come to an end. Anthem's servers are set to finally judder to a halt on January 12, 2026, putting an end to any way to play the game. That's seven days from now, if you've still not wrapped your head around what year it is. Which, hey, same. BioWare had its fair share of con…",

For the unfamiliar, Troika is a very 'realheads know' sort of studio: Its games presaged the similarly buggy (and occasionally unfinished) early work by Obsidian, which was also founded by ex-Interplay devs. But, also like Obsidian, Troika's games were ambitious, imaginative, and unforgettable. They had strong word-of-mouth reputations on RPG forums, and all three of its games have received essential fan patches and laudatory reappraisals, with the Big Kahuna arguably being the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines . \"We had a lot of feature ideas, we did not edit ourselves at all, and we were a small team,\" Cain summarized at the beginning of the video. \"Every time Troika went to make a game, whether it was Arcanum, or Temple of Elemental Evil, or Bloodlines, there were just so many things we wanted to do.

Scattered throughout New Vegas' Honest Hearts expansion, Clark's journals are an autobiographical account of the bombs falling and his experiences (and eventual death) in the world that followed. It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows.

Review \"This MSI is a fantastic demonstration of Samsung's latest QD-OLED tech. The HDR experience is stupendous, the ambient light absorption issue is mostly entirely solved and the subpixel structure has been sorted. It's just needs a few more pixels to be absolutely perfect for both gaming and daily computing.\" -Jeremy Laird Read our full MSI MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36 review . And he's not an easy person to please when it comes to gaming monitors, especially those with actually relatively low resolutions and pixel density figures. After all, the new MSI display is a 34-inch ultrawide with a 3440 × 1440 native resolution and therefore a 110 ppi density metric. With every other QD-OLED I've tested and touched with my eyeballs, that combination would have us all retching uncontrollably. Font fringing.

To discover that it ditches the usual shortcomings of Samsung's QD-OLED tech while capitalising on all that characteristic OLED goodness, including perfect per-pixel lighting and incredible speed? Well, there's good reason to think that it might just be a goer. Because this new MSI monitor rocks Samsung's very latest QD-OLED panel technology . MSI is referring to it as \"5th-Gen\" Samsung QD-OLED, which is news to me. I thought the very latest panel tech from Samsung is Gen 4. Likewise, MSI refers to not only \"5th Gen\" but \"5th Gen Tandem OLED\" when describing this panel technology, which leaves me a bit baffled. \"Tandem OLED\" has hitherto been a marketing pitch employed by LG, Samsung's main competitor in the OLED panel manufacturing industry, to describe its own latest WOLED technology. Has someone in MSI marketing department gotten a little over excited when it comes to both the 5th-Gen and the tandem thing? Very possibly.

Resident Evil 4's remake would have had one of these intros, a Chapter 0 where you play Ashley in the moments leading up to her capture. You can see moments from it in the trailer, but it was cut at some point in development—perhaps due to complaints about how similar prologues messed with the pacing of other Residents Evil. (Capcom seems averse to giving players the option to skip stuff in replays, which you'd think would be an easy fix to the problem.) Thanks to modder and YouTuber Michael Kemp, we can see what this mini Episode Ashley would have looked like. Well, sort of.

We're doing everything in shades of gray.

That's where Yes Man came in. If you haven't played New Vegas, Yes Man is a robot sporting a goofy grin and an inability to decline any command or truly be disposed of.

I'm not a huge fan art guy, but Deimos' work speaks to me—it reimagines this classic game through the lens of fine art, a style that emulates romantic painting, but applied to the side stories and characters of a 2010 RPG. 2281 Overture feels like a particularly illustrative example, showing an NCR-aligned version of the game's final battle with every companion ringed around the Courier (something you can't pull off in an unmodded game).

When you don't invest in gameplay, you don't just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.\" Hytale was \"barely playable\" when he reassumed control, Collins-Laflamme said, and all the game's basic systems were broken: \"Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering.

You can expect loads more city builders than these next year, but the ones listed below all take place in interesting places. If you want to build a city in a world filled with vengeful gods, in deep space on the back of a cosmic whale, or on a massive steampunk train thundering through a post-apocalyptic landscape, you'll be able to. There's even a builder set in a world of collectible creatures you can tame and send into battle. That's a first! Here's a quick look at 7 city builders coming in 2026 that will let us build in some truly wild places, such as… In a Rome where gods are real (and real angry) Nova Roma Release : Jan 2026 You won't need to wait long for this beautiful builder: it's due in January. Rebuild a fallen Rome, but be careful not to anger the gods: they're watching and won't be shy about voicing their displeasure in the form of lightning bolts and other disasters.

A teaser blog post on Steam said the new patch contains both \"largest, most vertical open area\" and \"the most sophisticated, lethal and complex enemy force\" yet seen in Gloomwood, and shows off more of the new areas, which look suitably gothic and dismal.

Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit. Any video of the tutorial is now festooned with comments mentioning Seehorn's character in Pluribus, jokingly factoring the role into the show's canon. You might know…",

It's really not hard! Really! I know Linux guys have been saying this for three decades, but it's true now! Goated w…",

We don't give a score of 90% or more to just any old thing—we're real hardware sickos with standards to match. And, as real hardware sickos, many a shiny bobbin has received a thorough humbling at our hands. Yes, we love RGB lighting as much as the next person, but it'll take far more than a sparkly light show to impress us. All of that said, a whopping 34 bits of kit earned a review score of either 90% or higher— that's 4 more than last year . But what was simply the best? It's interesting to note that only one bit of hardware among the highest-rated six costs less than $100. Spoiler alert, it's the Arctic Freezer 36 , going for a seriously impressive price tag that rests comfortably under $50. Still though, it's hard to ignore just how expensive PC gaming continues to be. With the memory pricing apocalypse upon us, not to mention how it's set to carry on into 2026 and beyond , a bit of kit's value proposition is never far from our minds. That said, the WD Black SN8100 2 TB NVMe SSD is still sitting pretty among our top six hardware review scores. There's …",

There's a lot I love about this job—particularly all of the opportunities I now enjoy getting to smear my sticky little mitts all over a wide range of hardware. Looking back on a year of hardware reviews, plenty of premium bits of kit didn't impress me much—especially when each penny has felt especially precious in recent years. So, setting the coveted category awards aside, it's definitely tricky to pick one techie thing that really spoke to me this year. That said, it's not like I don't have some cracking options to choose from for my personal pick. Could it be the Razer Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , the kitty-eared gaming headset that's just as much a fashion statement as it is a really premium audio device? Or is my personal hardware pick the Be Quiet! Light Mount , the quietest gaming keyboard anyone at PCG towers has had the pleasure of tinkling the keys of? Nope, it's a gamepad you can buy for less than $30 / £25 .

We'll post new personal picks each day throughout the rest of the month. You can find them all here . The Outer Worlds 2 is not the best RPG of 2025⁠—that's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 . Depending on who you ask it may not even be Obsidian's best game this year—at least one PCG editor thinks it was Grounded 2 , and I almost couldn't choose between it and Avowed. It speaks to the studio's deep bench and catalogue that in a year Obsidian launched two other games, The Outer Worlds 2 is still a standout. Obsidian's games rarely seem to get the praise they're due at launch, for one reason or another. Pillars of Eternity, Pentiment, and the first Outer Worlds strike me as notable exceptions. Otherwise, KotOR 2, Mask of the Betrayer, New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, Tyranny, and Deadfire are all games that took years to achieve cult classic status, let alone the couple that have finally become universally acknowledged classics. Deadfire and New Vegas launched in the shadows of more immediately lauded RPGs⁠—Divinity: …",
