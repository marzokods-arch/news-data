The earbuds appear to be getting a powerful, new “Head Gestures” feature. Samsung appears to be ditching the Buds 3 Pro’s sharp, triangular aesthetic in favor of a flatter stem and as well as a redesigned charging case. Samsung’s next-gen wireless earbuds — the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro — are expected to launch alongside the Galaxy S26 series. Mentions of the buds have been popping up for months, including traces in leaked One UI 8.5 firmware. But now, we’ve exclusively obtained new One UI 8.5 animations that showcase the earbuds and their features in detail. These leaked animations confirm the redesigned look of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, a style that may also carry over to the standard Buds 4. This is our most complete look yet at the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, along with a major new feature Samsung is preparing to debut.",

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic – for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.) But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the highest-…",

    "body": "I’ve owned a Kindle for as long as I can remember. It’s easily one of my most used gadgets and the one that’s accompanied me through more flights I can count, weekend breaks, and long sleepless nights engrossed in the latest horror or thriller read. But even as a Kindle die-hard, the more I use it, the more I’ve realised that for all its strengths, it’s a device that is truly living in Amazon’s walled garden, and is essentially behind much of the competition. You can’t really change how it looks beyond the basics. While you can add fonts, they won’t work with every e-book format. You can’t stop ads without paying extra. You can’t even stop it from downloading updates. The Kindle is designed to be a fully gated experience, and over time, that’s started to bother me. Even more so once I discovered that there is a way to unlock the Kindle’s full capabilities and bring it on par with competitors like the Kobo lineup. All it takes is a jailbreak to unlock the Linux-based Kindle’s full functionality.",

I have a small collection of old Game Boy, SNES, and N64 titles collecting dust in the attic, and I’ve turned to emulation to enjoy them while keeping the aging cartridges out of the reach of curious toddlers. Unfortunately, emulation and a shortage of time don’t really go hand in hand. I can never remember which device I played a game on last, meaning I might have one save on my phone and another on my laptop. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve not even had the correct ROM saved on my tablet. And then there are nights I’d prefer to play on the TV.

In the nearly two years since its release, we’ve seen the company fold in T-Mobile Tuesdays, T-Mobile Money, and even many in-store services, which now rely heavily on the app. It’s become almost impossible to interact with T-Mobile representatives without having a phone running a working copy of T-Life. At launch, T-Mobile promised the consolidated experience would be an upgrade for customers, making it easier to manage services and perform account-level tasks without calling customer service or jumping through hoops. As we approach 2026, the question remains: Is T-Life really as bad as some think, or has it finally matured into something worth using?",

Take a closer look, though, and it’s clear that we’re looking at a sidegrade or even a downgrade in some places. This wouldn’t be the first time OnePlus followed a fantastic flagship phone with a disappointing device.

    "body": "TL;DR As part of a settlement with Epic, Google is introducing support for “Registered App Stores” starting with Android 17. Certified third-party stores will utilize a “single store install screen” that automatically grants permission to install other apps. The agreement also prohibits device manufacturers from adding extra warning screens or barriers to block these store installations, prohibits Epic from bringing its Game Store to the Play Store, and ends the mudslinging between Epic and Google. Last week, Epic and Google proposed a settlement that would end their legal dispute over Android app distribution. As part of the settlement, Google committed to making major changes to the Android OS , the Play Store, and its communications and licensing agreements with developers and OEMs. One of the most significant changes involves introducing support for “Registered App Stores” in Android 17 . A “Registered App Store” is a third-party app store that Google has certified as a legitimate platform for downloading Android apps . Any store that receives this certification will be eligible to use Android’s new “single store install screen” for installation. This new screen will use “neut…",

Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo have reportedly halted memory purchases and are running low on RAM inventory. Increased demand for memory by AI data centers is driving the inflation. We might be in for inflated smartphone prices in the near future. A report released today says that smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi and OPPO are feeling the squeeze as makers of RAM and storage for smartphones are allocating more manufacturing capacity to clients building data centers. This increased demand for memory components is resulting in higher costs for manufacturers — and you know what that means. As reported by Jiemian News (via @Jukanlosreve on Twitter), smartphone manufacturers including Xiaomi, OPPO, and Vivo have suspended purchasing memory from suppliers like Samsung and Micron as those suppliers have increased prices drastically in recent months. Jiemian reports that a representative for an unnamed Chinese smartphone manufacturer told the publication their firm is now facing the prospect of either lowering specifications on new devices or increasing prices for customers.",

    "body": "TL;DR ChatGPT has dominated the AI market since it launched nearly three years ago, but competitors are beginning to catch up. Data reveals Gemini more than doubled its traffic share over the past year as ChatGPT’s market hold started to chip away. ChatGPT still represents over 70% of generative AI web traffic, although Gemini holds over 10% for the first time. OpenAI kicked off the AI race in late 2022 with the emergence of ChatGPT, the first mainstream chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs). Nearly three years later, the artificial intelligence landscape is ripe with competition. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, Anthropic, and xAI are vying for users and market share as they challenge ChatGPT. Data shared by Similarweb on X this week revealed Google is steadily building momentum and stealing web traffic from OpenAI. As the chart below reveals, ChatGPT had a staggering 86.6% of generative AI traffic share one year ago. Traffic share is a metric used to compare website activity to industry peers. It’s a proportion that represents the percentage of visitors a grouping of competing sites each receive in a particular market. In this case, this chart looks …",

OpenAI is searching for ways to turn its AI technology into consumer products that can compete with the likes of Meta and Google. It recently brought the Sora app, which offers a TikTok-like social feed for AI-generated videos, to the Google Play Store. Now, OpenAI is piloting group chats in ChatGPT. The feature will make it possible for users to chat with their friends and family while also tapping into ChatGPT for help. Rather than a standalone direct messaging system, group chats in ChatGPT are a way to collaborate with others within an AI chat. Users can start a new conversation with ChatGPT or open an existing one to begin.

Much like they can on iOS, users can choose to share their photo, phone number, and email, or opt only to receive the other person’s details in the Android version of the feature. Android and iOS have long reached points of maturity, and it’s no secret that both Google and Apple look at each other’s operating systems for “inspiration” on what to add to their own. We’ve seen iOS copy features like widgets, free app icon placement on the home screen, and more from Android. On the other hand, we spotted Google working on a Contact Posters-like feature for Android , which the company eventually rolled out as Calling Cards . We’ve now spotted Google working on bringing iOS’ NameDrop-like functionality to Android, and here’s what the experience could look like.

Google has offered a rollback tool, but that requires connecting to a computer over the Android Debug Bridge. Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble. And if it comes down to it, we can always take the nuclear option and factory reset — or, failing that, flashing to a more recent firmware that we know works. But what if we’re having a problem with a Google Play System update and would rather not start from scratch? As it turns out, Google’s in the process of giving us a new option there.

I also tested a bunch of 7.5W, 10W, 15W, and newer Qi and Qi2 chargers with the Pixel 9 and 10 series to find out which ones are the most problematic. With the Google Pixel 10 series , Google went all in on Qi2 wireless charging , embedding a MagSafe-like Pixelsnap magnetic connection. All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging. This upgrade sounds great on paper, but it has left users of older Qi chargers scratching their heads in confusion and frustration, and I’m one of them. As it turns out, Pixel 10 users have been complaining that their phones are not charging properly with chargers that aren’t Qi2 or Qi2 25W-certified.

Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup.

This year, Samsung released its first ultra-thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. The tech giant originally planned to follow it up with a sequel, but ultimately ended up canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge due to poor sales. As it turns out, the compromises required to shrink the phone down were not worth the squeeze.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new Contacts Picker tool for Android 17 to fix the current all-or-nothing contacts permission. This tool will allow you to share specific contacts with an app, rather than your entire contacts list. Access will be a one-time snapshot, and apps can request only the specific data fields they need. Your device’s contacts list holds a treasure trove of sensitive data that many apps want to get their hands on. Fortunately, Android’s permissions system prevents apps from accessing your contacts without your knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s an all-or-nothing system: You either grant an app access to all your contacts or none of them. This is highly problematic because it forces you to grant many apps full access to your contacts even if they don’t need it. Next year’s Android 17 update could tackle this problem by introducing a system Contacts Picker tool that allows you to select specific contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to your entire contacts list.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify has updated its default shuffle to a new “Fewer repeats” algorithm that avoids playing recently heard songs. Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2.
