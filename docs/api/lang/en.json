But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: It's a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it. (Spoilers for Season 1 below.) As previously reported , the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju —after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues.

At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details \"in the coming weeks.\" Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia's CEO now says the $100 billion figure was \"never a commitment,\" and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year. Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI's Codex , an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex's performance limitations to Nvidia's GPU-based hardware. After the Reuters story published and Nvidia's stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly.

    "body": "Chromebooks debuted 16 years ago with the limited release of Google's Cr-48 , an unassuming compact laptop that was provided free to select users. From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google's shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034. The documents were filed as part of Google's long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024 . While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge , the company's plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial. As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser ( which it did ). In Judge Amit Mehta's final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Apple has announced a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI's Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes. This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode. This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic's model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode's settings, it's possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally…",

I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned. I'd been working for several months at Babbage's store No. 9 , near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC's arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all.

Despite Harvard's victory, the Trump administration continued to push for some sort of formal agreement that would settle the administration's accusations that Harvard created an environment that allowed antisemitism to flourish. In fact, it had become a running joke among some journalists that The New York Times had devoted a monthly column to reporting that a settlement between the two parties was near. Given the government's loss of leverage, it was no surprise that the latest installment of said column included the detail that the latest negotiations had dropped demands that Harvard pay any money as part of a final agreement.

    "summary": "The pop-out door handle ban starts in 2027 for new cars, 2029 for existing models.",
    "body": "Flush door handles have been quite the automotive design trend of late. Stylists like them because they don't add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S , it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no. Just like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides . Tesla's handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths. Those deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg , and has concluded that no, they are not. Read full article Comments",

The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch. Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.

Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak. Read full article Comments",

Now, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D 's initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company's founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company. id Software's founders look back at an oft-forgotten piece of gaming history. Texture maps and \"undo\" animation Catacomb 3D was a follow-up to id's earlier Catacomb , which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet .
