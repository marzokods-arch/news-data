I've long been looking for a great fantasy game where instead of a brave adventurer I could just be a humble tavern keeper, and it's finally arrived—and appropriately enough, it's called Tavern Keeper . Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it. Tavern Keeper's tutorial is almost shockingly brief: after plopping you into a rundown pub in a gloomy swamp, you run through the basics of how to buy kegs of booze and serve them to customers, hire workers and assign them jobs, and order supplies that can be cooked into meals. But that tutorial is just the start of a learning process that hasn't ended even after eight hours of play.

I'm old enough to have used my dad's PC to play games a few years before we got a dial-up internet connection at home, but I'm still too young to have ever internalized what \"online\" meant before the world wide web. Reading a recent blog by longtime Windows developer Raymond Chen, I realized that when '80s computer geeks used the term, its meaning was completely flipped. \"The term 'online' originally meant 'immediately available on a computer,\" Chen wrote, explaining why Windows 3.0 (which was released in 1990) included WinHelp, a program built for browsing \"online\" help files.

Whether Payday 3 can be saved is a wide open question, but as a new trailer for an entirely different game makes painfully clear, it sure doesn't look good right now. The trailer in question is for update 18 of Crime Boss: Rockay City , and we might as well get this out of the way first: Yes, Crime Boss: Rockay City has had 18 updates since it launched in June 2024, yes it's still running, and yes, people are still playing it—not many people, no, but some. (More on this later.) Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever. It's not flat-out bad, mind, but as PC Gamer editor Wes Fenlon put it in a 2023 preview , Rockay City feels like the kind of game Uwe Boll would've turned into a movie.\" Anyway, back to the trailer: It looks like a fairly straight-ahead gameplay trailer, wi…",

Byer is just the most unrelentingly cheerful and engaging host in the biz, and frankly I'd watch her present absolutely anything. And if you don't have time for this ol' TV nonsense, I highly recommend checking out her podcasts, like Why Won't You Date Me? and Newcomers.

All those votes of approval from players haven't gone unnoticed by the team who have been pouring their efforts into the game for the past 11 years. \"Today, we reached an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' review score and it was an immensely emotional moment for us,\" Greenheart Games co-founder Patrick Klug posted on Steam. \"We were elated and grateful to reach this milestone among the bug-fixing and support spree. \"A bit later, I had a moment for lunch by myself when I briefly burst into tears. 11 years we have worked on this game, giving it our all, with no guarantees,\" Klug wrote. \"While obviously these are very early days and this game won't be an overnight success (nor a guaranteed one), it was a moment of brief validation.\" That's prett…",

For that notion to gain any traction for PC gaming, however, support for discrete graphics cards is needed. Say hello, then, to the Minisforum MS-R1 (via PC Watch ), a compact PC with an Arm chip and a full-sized x16 PCIe graphics slot. Game over for x86? Not so fast. For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

If you've been a PC enthusiast for as long as I have, then you'll probably look at SilverStone's new full-tower case with a warm heart and happy, fuzzy feelings. That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars? Internally, it's pretty much a standard full-tower case, with room for a 360 mm radiator at the top and space for graphics cards no longer than 386 mm.

RDR bucked that expectation when it straight-up killed poor ol' John Marston at the end. Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

While it's far from ideal for casual players who simply want to reset their tree, the Expedition Project is a smart approach to the controversial wipes mechanics of other extraction shooters. For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty. The issue many are running into is that, without a respec option, sending your character on an Expedition is the only way to reset your skill tree if you didn't go for the best skills —not helped by the fact that most Mobility skills don't work how you think they do .

Initially, Ubisoft tried to mollify said crowd , calm them down which… Well, it went about as well as you'd expect. The sky didn't fall. What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .' Speaking at a BAFTA event last year, former franchise head Marc-Alexis Coté put his foot down: \"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away.

No, it wasn't the whiskey playing tricks on me, it was instead another gift from my mischievous editor-in-chief. This time he's sent me a $23 Amazon Basics USB condenser microphone to review. Goody.

Is it even a full graphics card, or just a CPU cooler attached to some kind of board beneath? We may never know. Personally, I'm guessing the latter. While the cooler checks out as matching the Astral RTX 5080, there's no end bracket.

It's not that I'm friendly, but I am absolutely cowardly. Gimme some AI to stomp, rather than a sweaty gamer who might—god forbid—actually be better at the game than me. This is why the only extraction shooter I've really vibed with is the striking, atmospheric, PvE-only The Forever Winter . But with Arc Raiders being all anyone can talk about at the moment, I thought I should at least check it out. Arc Raiders shares some similarities with The Forever Winter, with its biggest threats all being robotic monstrosities, and with players all serving as desperate scavengers. And I was intrigued by what I heard about the community: that murder was not the end result of every meeting of players .

Other UI mods will stay untouched, but anything that gives you an overt advantage in a fight? It's being sent to the void. I can't say I blame Blizzard for this, even if I was hesitant at first . I still think the studio's taking on a huge task, given it's also having to completely redesign its classes to exist in an AddOn-less world, but assuming Blizzard can pull it off? I think the game'll be better for it. That's not to say there aren't bumps in the road. For example; some of those proposed changes note that Blizzard \"will NOT be allowing AddOns to support timer emphasis\". Say, for example, the 'three, two, one' audio cue that often comes with AddOns like Deadly Boss Mods (DBM). That's per an interview game director Ion Hazzikostas had with the authors of two major mods, Bigwigs and DBM.

Climbing through Roots is not for the faint of heart. The first challenge is the environment itself, as you have to rely on vines and bouncy mushrooms to get where you need to go.

Meanwhile, on the likes of Amazon, many DDR5 kit retail prices have doubled since August. The upshot of which is that while PC memory prices look unappealing right now, there's almost certainly worse to come. In really simple terms, there's a lag between spot pricing—which is the price DDR5 memory kit makers pay for DDR5 memory chips—and what we poor PC fans have to pay for actual memory kits. In other words, if you buy a new memory kit today, the company that made it would have bought the DDR5 chips some time ago, at a much lower price than today's DDR5 spot prices. Moreover, if DDR spot prices have gone up 170%, you can probably expect kit prices to go up by roughly that amount, eventually. And as bad as the 100% price jumps we've seen of late are, they're still not 170%-plus. Speaking of which, there's very much a consistent trend if you use Amazon to track memory prices.

And now Ball x Pit is slightly better because the November patch fixes a bunch of bugs, and as the top patch note explains, the encyclopedia has been updated with full-color icons. This may seem like a small thing, but the original version not only looked bland, but made it tough to tell at a glance whether you were looking at, say, a poison ball or an ice ball. Now that one is green and the other blue like God intended that's no longer an issue. (It was enough of an annoyance there was even a now-redundant Encyclopedia Colored mod .) The update also changes the way the retry option works: \"Retry no longer causes resources gained in previous run to be lost\". I still won't bother with it because I like going back to my base between runs to send the workers pinballing across the fields harvesting resources, even if I don't particularly need any wheat at the m…",

Now the developer says the employees were fired for violating company policy by sharing confidential information in a public forum. You might imagine a conspiracy to reveal secrets about the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 to the press or public, but the Independent Workers of Great Britain union says the employees in question were just speaking with labor organizers in a private Discord group. Rockstar and parent company Take-Two did not immediately explain the cause of the firings after the news broke last week , initially saying only that the employees were guilty of \"gross misconduct.\" In a statement sent to Bloomberg this week, the developer elaborated, saying that the workers had been \"distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum\" and that the firings were \"in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\" The IWGB, however, says that the only Rockstar outsiders the employees were speaking to were labor organizers.

(If you just want to know what it is, you can spoil it for yourself by reading the fourth slide in this article about PC gaming's greatest twists .) Jennifer Hale, the voice actor playing Jedi Master Bastila Shan in Knights of the Old Republic, did not know the twist in advance. As is often the case in videogame recording, she didn't get to see the script until she was in the booth. \"We never got our scripts ahead of time\", Hale recently told Buzzfeed . \"Most of the games I've ever done have been cold reading. I walk in, and I see the line. I do the line, and it goes to market.\" And so she got to be as shocked as most players were when she got to the end. \"I did not see the twist coming!\" she said. \"Knights of the Old Republic really sh…",

The moment, captured above, was from Gates' keynote at the then-major COMDEX trade show a few months before Windows 98's launch. Microsoft's Chris Capossela was in the middle of demonstrating a novel feature—plug-and-play USB support—by hooking up a scanner, prompting Windows 98 to download its drivers. Then, wham: Blue Screen of Death. Gates takes it in stride, quipping \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet,\" but I always figured somebody got chewed out for the crash afterward.

Are we $20 lawn guys?\" The idea that you can put the word \"simulator\" after any job or mundane activity and make a videogame out of it used to be a joke at the expense of series like Farming Simulator, but it's no joke anymore. A cottage industry has grown around simulating every job and activity it's possible to simulate: hairdressing, gold mining, home renovating, power washing, you name it. And inevitably, the people who actually do these jobs show up in the Steam user reviews to tell us how well the game matches reality, which is how I learned recently that firefighters do not, in fact, use the \"fireman's carry\" where you sling someone over your shoulders.

Anything on the internet that begins with \"my friend said\" triggers immediate suspicion, but the image of the ban message looks legit, and more to the point the listed fix does apparently work. My friend make a post on steam about disabling crossplay on PC and here is a result from r/Battlefield6 This is notable, because while the console versions of Battlefield 6 lets players toggle crossplay on or off, the PC version—so I'm told, I can't run it myself so I can't check—cannot.

Serious fans were unhappy, though, for a number of reasons, foremost among them the music. Music in the original Plants vs. Zombies is dynamic, you see, changing with the events on the screen, but for some reason EA did away with that in the remaster—instead, it only played the \"high intensity\" version of the soundtrack. It sounds like a minor thing (even at its most intense, PvZ music is pretty not intense ) but holy cow, did people notice—including composer Laura Shigihara—and they did not care for it .

In an interview with The Game Business , Obsidian vice president of operations Marcus Morgan and vice president of development Justin Britch said they know lots of people want followups to the studio's greatest hits, but the developers who work there are more interested in doing other things. The hangup is that after years of making games based on other people's properties—KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Dungeon Siege 3, South Park: The Stick of Truth—Obsidian is apparently having a pretty good time doing its own thing. \"I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, when’s the next New Vegas?

No, we're not talking about Duke Nukem Forever , the game that would eventually launch after 14 years of development in 2011, but another FPS that has now been largely forgotten in the PC gaming sands of time. That game was Prey, the now largely forgotten precursor to Arkane's completely non-related 2017 sci-fi FPS of the same name , an FPS that delivered a story about a Native American guy being abducted by aliens and his subsequent fight against them. So far, so standard FPS, right? But where 2006 Prey differed from most FPS games of the time was in its creative ambition, not only 100% committing to a grand, movie-style narrative and a rich Doom 3 engine-powered world, but by also being absolutely stuffed to bursting with ideas and novel gaming mechanics. From pre- Portal portals and anti-grav walkways, through shrink-ray-style miniaturisation, and onto out-of-body spirit walking and dimension-hopping ghost children, there was very little that Prey didn't throw at gamers.

But that has a downsized GPU with 32 CUs, significantly lessening the appeal of the device. Anyway, the \"base\" model with the top-tier 395 APU kicks off with a hefty 48 GB of memory. If that sounds like overkill, especially for a handheld, remember it's shared between the CPU and GPU. You also get a 1 TB SSD. The OneXFly Apex can be optioned up to 128 GB of memory and a 2 TB SSD.
