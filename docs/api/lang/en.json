The suspects fumbled an entire crown during their escape, before trying and failing to light their mechanical lift on fire as a diversionary tactic. Arsène Lupin would be appalled. How exactly, then, did the most renowned gallery in France find itself pillaged by a cadre of buffoons in high visibility vests? Reporting from French newspaper Libération indicates the theft is less of an anomaly than we might expect, as the Louvre has suffered from over a decade of glaring security oversights and IT vulnerabilities. (Image credit: Cass Marshall via Bluesky) As Rogue cofounder and former Polygon arch-jester Cass Marshall notes on Bluesky , we owe a lot of videogame designers an apology. We've spent years dunking on the emptyheadedness of game characters leaving their crucial security codes and vault combinations in the open for anyone to read, all while the Louvre has been using the password \"Louvre\" for its video surveillance servers. That's not an exaggeration. Confidential documents reviewed by Libération…",

This is Paradox's flagship grand-strategy series—its early-modern history sim that sees you guide one of a whole bunch of countries out of the late middle ages and into modernity, with almost certainly a whole lot of atrocities along the way.

There are years and years of decorations from various parts of the game that Blizzard is making available to stick in your house, which is why it's always seemed like a no-brainer for Blizzard to add. But there will also be new decorations, some of which are going to cost you real money, and now we have evidence of how that's going to work. Wowhead recently dug up a new premium currency in the Midnight alpha build called Hearthsteel. Datamined images depict Hearthsteel as silver coins with the swirly housing logo, which is based on Hearthstone's item art. Judging from the images that show different amounts of the coins, it seems pretty obvious that they're going to be a premium currency related to housing. While I doubt anyone will be surprised to see Blizzard preparing to charge for housing stuff this quickly, it's actually a first for WoW to have a distinct premium currency.

Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire. The biggest deal, though, is that we'll be able to freely switch between turn-based and…",

Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points. Using those measurements, they resized images of the overhead view of each in-game map until they shared a scale of 1 pixel per meter. \"There's always the risk of …",

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

Arc Raiders hit a new high in concurrent Steam players on Sunday, falling just shy of 355,000 people playing all at the same time. That's very good indeed—what's less good is that 355,000 people playing all at the same time put a little extra strain on the game's servers, and there was, as Embark put it, a wobble . Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues.

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

It's surprising, not just considering the fact that Nvidia is the first company in the world to reach a $5 trillion valuation , but also company CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments that the US needs to \"go compete\" with its AI chips in China.

The series that put the Swedish studio on the map has been missing in action since 2018, and if the words of its creator are anything to go by, we won't be seeing another one any time soon, if ever. In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

I'll be honest, I've never really understood the 'RPG to action game' pipeline that many popular series—and studios—have gone through. Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true.

LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements.

In Preview Build 26220.7051 , the real headliner for me is Shared Audio, a new feature that allows for two folks to watch the same movie or listen to the same playlist via two separate Bluetooth devices. It's the little things. For Windows Insiders, it works much like connecting your Copilot+ PC to any singular Bluetooth audio device. Just navigate over to the 'shared audio (preview)' tile in the quick settings menu, select two compatible, already paired audio devices, and then hit 'share'. Now, there truly is no escape from my Miku Hatsune playlist. Well, that is unless my put-upon pals can avoid placing themselves within about 30 paces of a compatible device.

Chances are, this is also where you headed for the earlier Scrappy upgrade that required lemons and apricots , though the olive trees are slightly larger than the fruit trees.

The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch.

The internals in the X make it the most powerful handheld gaming PC you can buy right now, but its FSE Xbox-style interface also adds a layer of bespokeness. According to the latest Windows 11 Insider notes , that software is starting to roll out to other non-Xbox devices, and MSI is first in line. As of today, those in the Windows 11 Insider dev or beta channels will have the option of accessing the Windows Full Screen Experience on the MSI Claw range of handhelds. In order to get it on your Claw, you need to be on the latest Insider Preview Build of Windows 11 (KB5067115), then you have to go into the gaming section of the Settings menu, and enable 'full screen experience'. As it's in a staged rollout, you may not see it when you boot your device up, but it should hopefully arrive over the next few weeks or so. The full-screen experience functions primarily as a UI overlay for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, and makes a Windows device feel a little closer to a console. It aggregates all your games from different storefront…",

The Windows anti-infringement system still works , helpfully declaring that this copy of the OS is not in fact genuine. If you want to noodle around with the outrageously small OS yourself, @XenoPanther has uploaded the file list to Archive.org .

    "body": "Fine, I'll say it. The Tropics has always been my least favourite biome in Peak . I hate the exploding mushrooms that always send me hurtling off the mountain, and the fact that everything can and will poison you. Not to mention the ticks. Luckily, a new biome is rolling out this week on November 5, which will be an alternative for the Tropics, though I'm not particularly thrilled about what might be lurking there either. In a trailer posted to the Aggro Crab and Landfall YouTube Channels, the Roots biome has been revealed. Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders. If they act in-game exactly as they do in the trailer, then these horrible critters will spring down from the top of trees and pick up Scouts. What happens from there is currently a mystery, but I don't doubt it'll end in your bo…",

What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN?

Considering it's on consoles and other storefronts too, Embark might be dealing with a bigger server load than it anticipated. Players are having trouble finding matches and are getting stuck in queue times ranging from 5 to 10 minutes before they're let back in. The subreddit is filling up with posts from players encountering errors and I can see several Twitch streamers waiting to connect. You can actually see a fairly sharp decline in players on SteamDB just after the game hit another all-time high at 337,834 players. It's currently sitting at around 286,000 players an hour after the spike. Plenty of people still seem to be able to play the game judging from the player numbers and ongoing streams, but there's enough commotion that the official Discord server has put a 15-minute timer on how often you can post in the main chat channel.

It wasn't that you were crouched in the middle of nowhere with absolutely zero cover. Definitely not. If you play enough competitive shooters, you'll learn pretty quickly about the tricks graphics settings can play on you. Arc Raiders is the newest shooter with a foliage problem and you might not realize it's holding you back—especially if you're a sweaty PvPer. Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\". YouTuber staycation provides a good example of the difference with some bushes around a car. With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance. The lowest setting gets rid of them entirely, giving you a clean view to line up a shot or catch someone hiding. Notably, the foliage setting doesn't seem to affect the bi…",

Final Fantasy 7's One Winged Angel will be the one that springs to mind for a lot of people, but I'm an absolute sucker for Final Fantasy 6's Dancing Mad—a whopping 18-minute, four-movement symphony that plays when facing off against Kefka Palazzo.

Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently.
