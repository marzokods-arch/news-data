For a company that made its bones in this category, its apps lack the ability to adequately help me find what I’m looking for, and I can’t think of a worse example than the Google Play Store. I’ve mentioned several of the Play Store’s flaws in a recent feature, but its search functionality — or lack thereof — is still one issue I can’t seem to shake. Thankfully, others have noticed this problem and developed their own pioneering solutions. Recently, I discovered an app that makes discovering Android apps so much easier; it’s called App Finder .",

Google Assistant, Siri, and even the newer Gemini integrations are essentially voice-activated search engines with a few smart home toggles attached. They operate within a very specific, very safe sandbox. While agentic control of your smartphone seems to be the future — and despite experimental projects like the Rabbit R1 attempting to bridge that gap — we haven’t quite seen a truly seamless implementation come to fruition just yet. For years, the promise of a digital assistant has boiled down to kitchen timers and weather updates. This frustration isn’t limited to mobile devices. Even in a desktop environment, these assistants quickly reach their limits. If you want to move a file from your downloads folder to a specific project directory based on its contents, or if you want to scrape a website and format that data into a local spreadsheet, these assistants simply hit a wall.

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",

The device runs Android 14 and supports stylus input, an optional keyboard, and 4G LTE connectivity. Pre-orders are live now, with pricing starting at $699 and shipping expected mid-February. As color E-Ink tablets edge closer to traditional tablets, Bigme has officially announced the B10. The generously sized device is positioned as a productivity-first tablet for reading, writing, and, with an optional keyboard, light work. The B10 is designed to deliver the paper-like experience associated with E Ink while still behaving more like a tablet than a traditional e-reader. It features a 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display that tops out at 2480 x 1860 resolution in black and white, with 1240 x 930 specs for color. It runs Android 14, giving users access to the Google Play Store and familiar productivity apps like Google Docs, Gmail, and third-party tools.

    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Log files from the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest Samsung may finally support Android’s Linux Terminal feature after skipping it on the S25 Ultra. The logs show support for the Android Virtualization Framework, a key requirement that was missing on Samsung’s last flagship. With the S26 series expected to launch on Android 16 QPR2, the devices should have everything in place to support the feature. When Google rolled out its Linux Terminal feature last year, it felt like a meaningful step forward for Android. The tool lets Android run a full Linux environment directly on the device, but Samsung’s own flagships were left out. Despite having the right hardware on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra didn’t support it. However, we’ve spotted signs that this may finally change with the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

The Galaxy S26 series is expected to launch in February, but at this rate, we might know everything about Samsung’s new phones before the company announces anything. Along with previously unseen renders of the Galaxy S26 Ultra that cropped up today, there are also new renders of the Galaxy S26 and S26+. All these new renders were published by Android Headlines this morning. The images published today show a device that looks pretty much like what we saw in renders the outlet shared in November , though in a dark gray color this time. Today’s report also shares some S26 specs that it says have been “confirmed,” including that the smallest Galaxy S26 will purportedly be astoundingly lightweight.",

AYANEO’s first gaming phone has been a little quieter than expected lately, partly due to the company’s recent service improvement roadmap and the decision to pause its crowdfunding plans . But we have a concrete update on the Pocket PLAY that clears up one of the biggest open questions about performance. In a new post on X , AYANEO confirmed that the Pocket PLAY will be powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 chipset. It’s a familiar flagship chip — albeit dating back to 2023 — and should be a solid pick, even if it’s not the latest silicon or the Snapdragon chip some fans may have been hoping for.",

After all the hype around the concept of a desk chair that bends with you as it reclines, how does the final product stack up? I’ve been sitting on the LiberNovo Omni for three months now, and while it’s not perfect, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an ergonomic chair try to do as many things as this one, and do so many of them really well.",

    "body": "TL;DR OnePlus’ bypass charging feature now works beyond gaming, letting phones pull power directly from the charger during heavy use to reduce heat and battery wear. More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

Regulators have officially launched an investigation into the 10-hour blackout that sidelined millions of customers and, more critically, potentially blocked access to 911. On the afternoon of January 14, Verizon’s wireless voice, text, and data services failed for users across the country. Outage reports quickly rose on trackers like Downdetector, reaching hundreds of thousands in just a few hours.

The integrated DLP projector displays a 1920×1080 Full HD image at around 220 lumens, and supports keystone correction and laser auto-focus up to roughly 4 meters, helping keep projections sharp and properly aligned with minimal manual adjustment. While it’s certainly not going to replace your TV, it’s a notable step up from the dim, novelty projectors previously attached to smartphones, and one that could prove genuinely useful for camping trips or quick presentations in the field.",

The age of PC emulation on Android is upon us, with new translation layers and software allowing you to play Steam games on your phone or Android gaming handheld without any fuss. Now, for the first time, you’ll also be able to play titles from the Epic Games Store library, thanks to a nightly update from GameNative. And if you’re like me, that amounts to literally hundreds of free games claimed over the years. While support is still experimental, the setup is fairly straightforward. After you install the latest GameNative nightly update, open the settings and scroll down to Epic Games Integration. From there, it will open a browser where you can log in to your Epic Games account. Then, you need to copy an authentication key, paste it into GameNative, and it should automatically populate your game list (give it a minute if you have 500+ games like me).",

The Galaxy Watch 4, Samsung’s first smartwatch running Google’s Wear OS, launched more than four years ago. For most Android smartwatches, that timeframe can be safely considered the initiation of their end-of-life period. And so when Samsung released the One UI 8 Watch update for Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic , it felt like a special, heartfelt farewell. However, the update did not pan out as Samsung may have hoped for, and ended up causing a myriad of issues on the Galaxy Watch 4 series . That includes problems with sensors, always-on display (AoD), poor battery life, and a laggy interface on the Watch 4. While these issues prompted Samsung to halt the update midway, users who had already jumped ship were left frustrated. Thankfully, Samsung has released a fresh update, and it appears to address these issues for the majority of people.",

The Nothing Phone 3 can be classified as less than a success. While it excelled in terms of fun, quirky features , the Phone 3 did not thrive in terms of practicality or value. Despite its novelty, the non-flagship chipset and an $800 price tag easily made the phone feel impractical . And Nothing appears to have taken the verdict to the heart, to the effect that it is taking 2026 to mull over flagships instead of releasing one. In a recent video shared on the official Nothing YouTube channel, co-founder and CEO Carl Pei confirmed the company won’t launch a flagship phone in 2026.
