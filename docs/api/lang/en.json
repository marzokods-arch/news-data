Absolum is a brilliantly clever hybrid of classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up combat with a roguelike framework, and I'm not sure it ever quite got the buzz it deserved. It seems like it found an audience, at least, with 500,000 players , a 94% positive rating on Steam and apparently enough success to fuel a new free update . Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Arriving on February 12, the 1.1 patch will make further tweaks and fixes, but more importantly add a raft of new content to give the experience even more replayability. \"Mystic Ordeals\" are customisable modifiers you can apply to runs after you've beaten the final boss, so you can keep testing your skills. And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process. The update's also adding elite mounts—rarer versions with upgraded attacks—as well as new emotes for co-op play and unlockable character skins. …",

You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too.

My favourite way to cut through the chaos of multiplayer shooters or terrifying horror games is to sprinkle in some light-hearted games, whether they be sims or puzzles, I don't care, as long as it resets my adrenaline. I stumbled across Little Woody after playing one too many Arc Raiders matches. With a free demo currently available, I thought there was no harm in checking out this 2D point-and-click puzzle game and having a change in pace. The only reason I was wrong in thinking this is actually because I enjoyed it too much, and suddenly reaching the end of the demo enraged me more than a backstab in Arc Raiders could—I was just starting to get into the puzzle-solving groove. (Image credit: Prism Realm Ltd.) But even if Little Woody's demo may be painfully short, what I played was enough to convince me to wishlist the game and start a countdown for its release.

World of Warcraft: Midnight means to carry on this new philosophy, as stated in a roadmap included in a State of Azeroth video posted to Blizzard's official channels today. In it, a post-launch roadmap laid out a step-by-step plan for what players could expect to see after the expansion's launch. First up: Prop hunt. WoW's just getting a prop hunt. No I am not kidding, they are putting a prop hunt in World of Warcraft. I mean, it makes a certain kind of sense—Blizzard's player housing system has been in early access for a while now, meaning hundreds of different assets have been broken off into unique, collectible furniture models. The question you might ask yourself as a developer is, indeed, \"what do we do with all of these moveable assets?\" and the first answer that comes to mind is probably going to be \"prop hunt, I guess?\" (Image credit: Blizzard) While I'm sure it'll be a jolly old…",

Luckily, the Meta Quest 3 I'd been neglecting for the last six months offered a welcoming solution to my problems. I could exercise in the warmth, without having to be sick and generally unpleasant around sweaty strangers. My rubric is simple. I didn't want to overcomplicate the act of just doing some exercise, so I set myself an exercise goal via my smart watch, without signalling to my watch when I was exercising. Instead, I would just let it tally up exercise based on physical exertion. So, if I slacked, I wouldn't finish. To establish some ground rules, I decided this would not be a replacement for traditional exercise, and traditional exercise would not be a replacement for it. I would try to do a minimum of 25 minutes of VR workouts every day, regardless of any other kind of movement I had achieved.

Despite hitting the ground running with the feature, though, Blizzard's keen to keep making improvements.

Auto browse, however, can apparently go a lot further. \"Auto browse can help you optimize your vacation planning by doing some of the mundane work, like researching hotel and flight costs across multiple date options, so you can find a budget-friendly time to travel\", says Google.

Also, it managed to make 162% less operating profit for an overall loss of 245.4 million Swedish kronor (around $28 million). Uh oh! And the reason is, well, yeah, it's Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2. \"The profit line, or EBIT [earnings before interest and taxes] is affected by a big writedown of the game Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2,\" said Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester. If you'll recall, Paradox announced last November that its troubled sequel to cult classic Bloodlines 1 hadn't sold as well as it had hoped , leading to a write-down of 355 million kronor. Profit was also impacted by \"scheduled amortisation of the entire capitalised development cost [for Bloodlines 2] over the period from October to December 2025, amounting to MSEK 345.7.\" Unlike the wince-inducing write-down, though, that's just a fairly bog-standard bit …",

The chip-integrated fibres are said to be as thin as a human hair, and can withstand repeated bending and abrasion, stretching, twisting, and even \"crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons\". Their results have been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature , and the potential uses for such a thin, bendable, and resilient tech are legion (via SCMP ). Beyond the possibility of creating fabrics where every fibre is its own miniature system, the scientists say that the tech could also be leveraged into brain-computer interfaces. The study into the fabric-like tech was led by Professor Huisheng Peng at Fudan University. The researchers built circuits onto an elastic substrate, before rolling it into a thin, resilient fibre which can function as a complete microcomputer system. \"FICs can process both digital and analogue signals similar to commercial arithmetic chips and perform neural computing with high recognition accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art in-memory image process…",

Or it should be, which is what creature-collecting gacha game Aniimo is betting on. Someone is probably going to nail the freemium critter game combo soon, but after playing in its current closed beta test I just don't think Aniimo is the one. It's rolled a real winning pair of words, but hasn't found enough originality to win me over in the overstuffed gacha game field of 2026. Gacha catch 'em all In Aniimo you're the Pathfinder, a fresh-faced recruit headed down to the continent Idyll to collect aniimos for reasons that I forgot even as they were being explained to me in a cutscene. Are any of us internalizing the story in gacha games anymore? Dramatic motivation aside, you've got to explore Idyll, catch the aniimos you find wandering its biomes, \"twine\" to transform into them and use their skills to solve small open world puzzles, and occasionally battle it out with high level world boss aniimos in real-time combat. The first aniimos I find are all pretty expected for a creature catcher: a big fluffy sheep…",

After spending a week with a pre-release build of Destiny of the Railforged , my enthusiasm is renewed. Though the DLC doesn't touch every aspect of Monster Train 2 (there are no new Alcove events, for example), it's a substantial package that makes an already large experience feel supersized. Also there's a card that lets you grab units—friendly or enemy—with a giant claw and move them to another floor, which feels cool as hell. Yoink .

Its Xbox hardware revenue continues to fall and even its overall gaming services revenues are on the slide. Xbox hardware revenues are reportedly down by 32% in the final quarter of 2025, while overall gaming revenue was down 9%. Microsoft also says in its earnings release that Xbox content and services revenue, including Game Pass, were down by 5%. So, basically anything to do with Xbox and gaming for Microsoft is on the slide, though as The Verge notes, Microsoft isn't releasing any information on Xbox Game Pass membership rates. That obviously makes it difficult to gauge the impact of the Game Pass Ultimate price hike , which wasn't exactly warmly received by gamers. Microsoft's whole Xbox endeavour, of course, is currently in flux. The company has continued to publish more games for play on Sony's competing PS5 console as part of its broader—and some would argue, incredibly confusing—\" This is an Xbox \" push to redefine what an Xbox means.

Unfortunately Ubuntu is the only officially supported distro for now, although Nvidia does want to bring it to further ones and is \"actively evaluating\" them.

We meet her at the foot of Mount Kami: an impossibly lofty summit once home to a society of troglodytes with a preference for living vertically. It's her self-assigned mission to be the first to surmount it.

It's perhaps the most open secret in videogames right now, spoiled ahead of time by everything from age rating boards to anonymous sources to its own lead actor , Matt Ryan—who subsequently told a different fan pressing him for info that'd say nothing more, because \" the company threatened to sue me \". I guess Ubi's loosened up since then, because the official Assassin's Creed X account is now posting GTA memes about yet another possible leak. AC fan account Zephryss posted images of a statuette of Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway, writing that it \"might be the new Edward Kenway figurine for the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake\" and had been found by fans on second-hand site Vinted. In response, the AC account posted that old classic: CJ returning to San Andreas with the subtitles \"Ah shit, here we go again.\" For reference, this would be the second time this remake has been leaked by a statue , if genuine. Which is quite funny, to be fair, and makes sense: as I've written in too many headlines…",

It's frankly incredible that Meta has that kind of money to spend speculatively on something that, currently, isn't proving lucrative for anyone apart from the people selling the picks and axes to help you search for the money. The BBC reports that Meta's CEO said yesterday that he expects \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\" Of course, you could argue that the big change in the way that Meta itself will \"work\" is that this spend represents a massive pivot away from virtual reality and the Metaverse, which was what Zuckerberg used to say would change the way we all work, in favour of AI.

Between June 2020 and December 2025, Cain was in what he called semi-retirement. He was still working on games as a consultant, but as a freelance, remote contractor. After moving to Seattle, he couldn't stay at Obsidian full time as it wasn't prepared to have out-of-state employees. He says that working on different games and with different teams was \"so much fun,\" but \"when you're a contractor you're constantly looking for the next thing.\" I freelanced for two years, and I never managed to escape that overwhelming feeling that I needed to find more work, so I completely understand why he went back to California and Obsidian. \"I'm not in charge of a project, I'm not a director,\" Cain says. \"You can think of it as more of a consultant.

But enough about the financials. The news I was most interested in came in MS CEO Satya Nadella's opening remarks , in which he revealed that its current OS has reached a significant milestone: \"One billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year\". It's not difficult to see why this might be the case. After all, Windows 10 experienced something of a slow death in 2025 , as Microsoft turned off the lights and pushed the majority of users over to Windows 11. Sure, there's the Extended Security Updates program for those that really want (or have) to dig their heels in, but otherwise it's unsurprising that vast numbers of regular PC users have eventually made the switch, reluctantly or otherwise. Not that Windows 11 is a particularly bad OS these days, at least in my opinion.

This one has guns and a motorbike , mind you, so it's probably the greatest videogame ever made.

I've collated the game's launch times across multiple regions below, so you can know exactly when you can start veining. When does Code Vein 2 launch? (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Code Vein 2 launches at 3 pm PST on January 29 , giving California a good window to get it downloading while it's still at work. Of course, if you got the pricey deluxe edition, then it actually unlocked for you three full days before that time and date, in which case what are you doing here?

That was the case even after Team Ninja apologized for their previous game, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, running like crap on PC . If you cast your mind back five years ago, Nioh 2 also had a less-than-ideal launch. Ninja Gaiden 4 ran decently by all reports, but the settings options left a lot to be desired . I'm not here to give a full performance run down of Nioh 3, but I've just spent a couple of hours running around in its newly released demo and I can confirm that I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works on my aging game laptop.

It was basically all over for my free time from then on. Which is why it's wild, more than a decade later, to be reminded of Atom Zombie Smasher's existence by it being patched. This 15th anniversary update isn't going to transform the top-down rescue sim where the zombies are tiny pink squares into The Last of Us 3, but it does add a horde of little changes. For starters, where before you could slow time down to 10%, now you can drop it all the way down to 1%. That's so slow you're basically making Atom Zombie Smasher turn-based, a change I approve of in any tactics game. Also changed: you can deselect units with the Escape key; the seams around cutscene vignette art are gone; and when you're on the Behind the Scenes screen the scroll limit works so you don't scroll too far and end up looking at the game as it would be seen from a passing aeroplane.

Unlike Mr. House, I'm not particularly good at predicting the future, though I'm still holding out hope Mysterious Stranger shows up in the middle of a gunfight in the final episode of the season. In the meantime, Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 let us finally meet a character who's been part of the story for a long, long time, even though we've never seen them before. In the Fallout games this person has been mentioned since Fallout 2, meaning they've been part of Fallout lore for more than 25 years. In the history of the series this character has been critical to world events, yet we've never seen their face, not even in a picture. The show had every chance to continue the tradition by, say, just showing them in silhouette or by obscuring their face, but nope! There they were, on the screen at long last, putting to rest a long-standing mystery about their appearance. Last chance to avoid spoilers! With so much detailed lore about Fallou…",

The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on. The end result feels a bit like…",

This session resulted in broad agreement among the group about what a succession plan should look like, and an explicit plan for what to do next (which has now started). A brief explainer of Torvalds' importance before we get into things. The Linux kernel development project has over 100 programmers each working to maintain and incorporate changes in their own repositories. But the final step in any Linux release is where all of this work is centralised and incorporated into the mainline repository: this has on almost every occasion been done by Torvalds.
