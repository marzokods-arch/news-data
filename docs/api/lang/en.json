You'll likely have a long trek ahead of you, but grabbing some kelp isn't all that tricky once you know where to look. How to get azure kelp in Hytale Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Hypixel) The best place to find azure kelp is in bodies of water like lakes and rivers in azure forest biomes found in Emerald Grove , the starting zone. These areas have distinctive blue trees, blueish grass (azure, you could say), and you'll often find lots of small ponds or rivers cutting through them. You can easily spot azure forests on your map, so zoom in to check if there's any water before trekking over. Search the bodies of water and you should find azure kelp, a bright blue plant that shimmers and often pokes out of the water. Since it's a plant, press F to harvest it. Breaking it with any tool or even your hands drops azure petals, which aren't what you want in this case. In …",

    "summary": "The best of both worlds?",
    "body": "Here's one that didn't show up on the CES 2026 show floor. Asus has some new dual-mode 4K monitors with uprated, higher-refresh 1080p modes . We've seen plenty of 4K dual-mode monitors before. But thus far, the 1080p alt mode has run at precisely twice the refresh rate of the panel's native 4K setting. But now Asus is launching two new monitors with 1080p modes that run at 3x and 4x the refresh of their respective 4K modes. By way of example, I reviewed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG last summer . That's a 27-inch 4K model that hits 160 Hz at 4K and therefore 320 Hz at 1080p. Now there's a new version of that display, dubbed the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG Gen 2. As before, it'll do 160 Hz at 4K, but now hits 480 Hz at 1080p. That latter figure should be enough to satisfy pretty serious esports gamers and in turn allow the XG27UCG Gen 2 to offer the best of both worlds in terms of 4K image detail and 1080p speed. The other newcomer is the Asus TUF Gaming VG27UQEL5A. That's another 27-inch 4K model, but this time with a native 75 Hz 4K mode and a 4x 1080p 300 Hz mode. So, it's actually the 3x model that hits the higher refresh rate. It's just also starting at a much higher base 4K refresh. …",

It reportedly comes with deceptive names like \"Upcoming_Products.pdf\" and has an attached open-source PDF reader app. In many cases, this download would come with an uncompromised RAR file, which might make the parent folder seem real. When the reader boots it up, the file sideloads a malicious DLL file, which is placed in the same directory as legitimate ones. This not only evades detection but makes the downloaded file seem totally genuine as a result. That means one could go some time without realising their PC has been compromised. Once up and running, that malicious DLL file pops a Python interpreter onto the system, which runs a script to create a registry Run key. This ensures that the Python interpreter is active on login to the system, and can even give remote access to the user. From there, bad actors can take information from the machine.

Now, of course, it's very different: sometimes most people don't like the game . They're still complaining about Bethesda's Creation Engine though, which remains based on that rickety, hilarious Oblivion engine from 2006 (itself based on the engine of games before it). Someone else who's perhaps a tad fed up with the Creation Engine? Dean Carter, lead on Fallout: London, the sweeping Fallout 4 overhaul that transplants you from Boston to the Big Smoke. In a chat with Esports.net , Carter said that—while the Creation Engine actually has a lot of upsides—he's worried Bethesda is gonna stick with it for Fallout 5. \"I’m really worried that they’re gonna keep going with the Creation Engine,\" said Carter. \"I’m not just someone that’s going to sit there and lie and say it’s a terrible engine… but I do think it started to show its age.\" In particular, it…",

As reported by TorrentFreak , an amended complaint (pdf warning) filed at the district court in Oakland, California last week, specifically claims that staff at Nvidia contacted a so-called 'shadow library' known as Anna's Archive, a repository of pirated books and other documents.

Both of these have been fixed. Embark Studios has also \"fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry\", which doesn't sound like it was too pleasant. Then there's the Stella Montis kinda-fix, which is an issue that's been hanging around in the game for a couple months: players anecdotally report that Embark has been replacing items for players particularly caught-out by this, though it's an open question whether certain spots persist for ne'er-do-wells to take advantage of.

With four Zen 5 cores and eight Zen 5c cores, and clocking in at a max boost clock of 5.2 GHz, it's a pretty powerful chip. Previously, Ayaneo's Konkr range has relied on Snapdragon chips, namely the G3 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. This is a step above the Android-based OS of the Snapdragon Pocket Fit . Built-in Windows support gives the handheld a boost in terms of compatibility with vast libraries of games on Steam and anti-cheat. If you're confused on the naming, the Konkr Fit is the one with an AMD chip, Windows operating system, and a larger frame. It comes with a seven-inch OLED screen. The Konkr Pocket Fit is Android-based, smaller, and presumably cheaper, with this model ranging from $299 to $329. The Pocket Fit comes with a six-inch LCD display.

It's adding two new characters, eight new balls, \"several\" more passives, and a \"nice surprise we don't want to spoil just yet\"—which all in all seems like a very robust set of features. (Image credit: Kenny Sun) While they don't sound too revolutionary, the two characters seem like fun additions to the roster. The Carouser's power is that when his balls return to him, they spin in a circle around him, which should make him particularly powerful at close range. Meanwhile the Falconer fires her balls from two birds on either side of her, who seem to sit against the walls of the stage and shoot inwards—a bit like a remix of the Cohabitants. The true Ball X Pit fiends among you will already be thinking of possible combos with other character powers.

Hong Kong-based tech creator 小宁子 XNZ has built a 3-in-1 console that swaps between a PS5, Xbox Series S, and a Switch 2 at the push of a button (via TechSpot ). It's a project vaguely reminiscent of Origin PC's The Big O , a liquid-cooled desktop with either a PS4 Pro or an Xbox One S console tucked inside, back in 2020. The creator calls her 3-in-1 effort the 'Ningtendo PXBOX 5,' and it turns out this hunk of hardware was no easy thing to create. Rather than simply strapping all of the hardware together (which the YouTuber demonstrates would be both unwieldy and weigh a hefty 10 kg), she stripped everything down to its electrical components and completely rethought the hardware's housing. Don't worry, no motherboards were folded ' like a book ' or otherwise harmed during this project. Noticing that individual PSUs and cooling …",

I've even seen people recreate all sorts of characters: Link, Jinx, Aang, Beast Boy, the list goes on. So why then does Hytale's very generic-looking metal armour completely cover it up? Getting armour is one of the very first things you'll want to do, too, so you look fabulous for all of five minutes, and then you end up looking like everyone else. Where's the fun in that? It's even more baffling since all of the bonus items packaged with the more expensive versions of Hytale include new cosmetics. You could spend $83.99 to get a ninja costume, a forest fairy outfit, wizard robes, or even a pop star set, only to have it obscured by boring ol' metal plate. Thankfully, that won't be the case for much longer. Hytale Update 2, which arrives in pre-release testing sometime this week, will add the ability to hide your helmet and armour.

    "body": "Back in the 1990s, my fellow PC chums and I thought we had stumbled across a magic trick with Windows 95, something that we thought nobody else knew about: holding the shift key when you hit restart just fired up the operating system again, not the whole PC. Alas, it turns out that we were all just very naive, and Microsoft's software engineers had deliberately coded this functionality. Yes, I know that's blatantly obvious—it's not like Windows 95 was created out of mystic spells and ground up weevils—but back then, there was surprisingly little in the way of information about the inner workings of Windows, let alone any comprehensive guides to every function and feature. In his Old New Thing blog , Raymond Chen explains the 'secret sauce' behind what was going on with the whole shift+restart trick. Just as it does now in all versions of Windows, clicking on restart in Microsoft's then massively updated Windows 95 forced the PC to initiate a cold reboot, i.e. shutdown all processes, clear the memory, and cycle the hardware. However, holding down the shift key forced a different process: the PC wouldn't restart, just the operating system itself, displaying 'Windows is restarting' o…",

That's right, how long it'll take you to get the voidhearts you need is largely down to luck. To help you out, I'll go over the best methods of getting voidhearts below. Just note that it requires some fighting, so grab the best gear you can currently craft, like cobalt or thorium. How to get voidhearts in Hytale Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Hypixel) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Hypixel) You have a chance of getting a voidheart by killing any Voidspawn enemy—creepy monsters that only spawn at night . Contrary to what you may have heard, voidhearts aren't exclusive to Void Eyes (the big floating eyes with tentacles). In fact, I've had the best luck getting them to drop from Void Spawns (the humanoid beasts with large swords). My advice is to go to either the Howling Sands (desert) or Whisperfrost Frontiers (snow) zones at night. Since these biomes …",

When you find one of those in the midst of an already-ongoing sale, making it all even cheaper? Baby, that's the good stuff. Well, joyous news: you can now share that glee with your Steam pals. As spotted by SteamDB , Valve has recently pushed a change through that means you can now purchase these kinds of bundles as gifts. The discounting feature works as it should: if you buy a bundle for someone who already has some of the games featured in it, it'll cost you less overall.

A number of remedies were proposed, including Google's divestment of the Chrome browser (which will ultimately not come to pass ), and most pertinently right now that the search giant shares its data with rival companies. The DOJ secured this latter remedy among others back in September , with the US District Court ordering \"Google to make certain search index and user-interaction data available to rivals and potential rivals.\" Google is now asking to postpone the sharing of this data while it appeals the DOJ's ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly. To date, many have criticised how the DOJ is handling its case against Google, saying that many of its remedies so far have amounted to little more than ' a slap on the wrist .'

The listed specs do include 5V three-pin ARGB connectivity for controlling the ZM-VS3 DS's RGB lighting strip and USB 2.0 for hooking the display directly to a motherboard USB header, which is either kinda neat or suboptimal if you think absorbing an entire header for one tiny display limits your broader USB connectivity options.

    "body": "Of all the things that amaze me about Larian Studios' RPGs, it's undoubtedly their longevity that's the most surprising. Pulling in over 875k concurrent players on Steam alone, Baldur's Gate 3 was a massive success at launch, and close to three years later, it's still one of the most played games on PC, routinely hitting peaks of 50-80k concurrent players. Larian's previous game, Divinity: Original Sin 2, by no means caught on like wildfire, but it achieved nearly 94k concurrent players back when it launched in September 2017. Since then, it's been seeing 10-20k player peaks every month. That's all to say that Larian's games hang around like almost no other single-player RPGs do, even competing with live-service titles intentionally designed to maintain a consistently strong playerbase. Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of Divinity. D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017. Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :) https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r January 20, 2026 And just when I thought it surely couldn't keep this up, both BG3 and D:OS2 have started to pick up steam once again.

In the case of Intel's 12th Gen Core processors, the end officially started at the beginning of 2026, with January 22, 2027 being the final date for the shipment of any 12th Gen chips. The fact that I am only writing about this now suggests that PC enthusiasts are perhaps not all that interested in these CPUs, but they should be and for good reasons. First of all, the Alder Lake architecture marked Intel's first attempt at implementing a hybrid core design in desktop processors (it had done so previously with mobile-only Lakefield in 2020). Sporting the monikers of Performance and Efficient core (aka P-core and E-core), with the former handling the donkey work in games and the latter used for background tasks or weighing in with thread-heavy workloads, the markedly different core designs have remained front and centre in Intel's approach to all its consumer CPUs. All the 'Lakes' since the launch of 12th Gen Core have been hybrid, with the latest iterations ( Arrow Lake and Panther Lake ) boasting so…",

From the game's opening seconds it's obvious this was a massive labour of love for Harmonix, the studio that had kicked-off the whole genre with the original Guitar Hero. Many of those involved in bringing the project to life have now given interviews for The Oral History of Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Music Game Boom , a newly released book by journalist Blake Hester, with an excerpt detailing some of those initial meetings published on Design Room .

But this, it turns out, is not a normal day at the office. Your boss had the good sense to stay home, but you are not alone: Before long you're not only preparing the deceased for their funerals, you're also conducting occult rituals to ward off demonic forces. Talk about multi-tasking! I suppose it's inevitable at this point, three years after the release of the game, but the trailer for the film adaptation of The Mortuary Assistant doesn't land quite as well for me as the game did. The game, at least in the early going, is relatively subtle: Creepy as hell, yes, but things happen slowly at first, and the tension is elevated by the inherent unpleasantness (for me, anyway) of routine mortician work.

Arrowhead said on January 16, a few days after Redacted Regiment was revealed, that \"during final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn't meet our standards for a release .\" Some fans have speculated that effectively working stealth into Helldivers 2—which in my experience is very much a not -stealthy game—may have proven more complicated than expected.

The accompanying blog post states it \"represents more than a milestone; it’s a turning point—one that sets RuneScape firmly on course for the future it deserves.\" The plans detailed in the post are already in motion, as Treasure Hunter is already out of the game.

This versatile little tri-laser beamer seeks to follow your lead, and light up your life with a cornucopia of practical portability features. I wouldn't say you're looking at a projector as much as you're looking at a technological druid packing the Wild Shape spell. In all my years of reviewing tech it's become painfully clear that a plentiful feature set usually points to at least a couple of small caveats. No projector could possibly nail everything expected of it, especially with a price so reasonable. There's nothing glaringly wrong to note while unpacking this stylish little machine, unless the curved, retro look offends you terribly. So let's get into where the MoGo 4 Laser projector excels, and where it's maybe a little less effective. Now, I love a transformer. Any piece of tech that can shift from projector, to soundbar, to fancy lightshow with the flick of some far-out mechanism gives me a palpable dopamine hit.

From the hour and change I've played Big Hops looks to be joining that proud tradition. Developed by Luckshot Games, Big Hops sees you playing as Hop. Who, contrary to the game's title, is just a little guy—perhaps the littlest guy to have ever done it. It's a cute setup for a collectathon: Getting split off from your sister, Hop finds a temple with some mysterious frog statues that promise they're super cool, actually. 'Just collect some cursed orbs for us, c'maaahn', they say. 'Is this a setup for a world-spanning adventure?' I ask. 'Maybe,' they reply.

VR headsets are becoming fairly popular, but the dream of putting on a headset and seamlessly teleporting to an immerse new world, while my lounge room fades away, is yet to be realised. While modern headsets have come a long way, they either lack the visual fidelity to fool the eyes, the comfort to convince the body, or more likely a bit of both. The Pimax Crystal Super is an example of a headset that does a lot to solve one of these problems, while kinda forgetting about the other. The Pimax Crystal Super boasts some pretty impressive specs, but as such needs a mighty PC to run. Pimax recommends you have at least an RTX 2070 to run the thing, but realistically, if you’re running anything less than a 4080 then you’re not going to scratch the surface of this impressive display. There’s simply no reason to drop the $2,000 on this headset without a high-end PC to power it. You’re far better off grabbing a lower specced VR set-up and upgrading later. You’re also beholden to Pimax’s software, which acts as a driver hub and is required to be configured to play some games li…",

It's hard to know when to expect the features, though 2027 is the earliest window players might see it.

I've found that the deeper you go, the better your chances of finding adamantite, though there are no strict spawning restrictions based on depth like Minecraft. Importantly, adamantite also…",

    "body": "Hytale 's got truckloads of different materials that roadblock progression, requiring you to explore Orbis far and wide. Cindercloth scraps are one such example, though they're not actually as hard to find as you might think. The main hurdle is that the area you need to reach isn't somewhere I'd recommend you visit on a vacation—too much lava and reanimated skeletons. Grab the best sword and armour you can craft (most likely thorium or cobalt), as both options for getting cindercloth scraps in Hytale require a fair bit of fighting. Don't worry, it'll be worth it for that sweet, sweet adamantite gear. How to get cindercloth scraps in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) The best way to get cindercloth scraps early on in Hytale is to kill fire-themed incandescent skeletons in the volcanic biome underground in the first zone, Emerald Grove. If you've not been to this area yet, explore deep underground caves in the starting zone until you see embers in the air, volcanic rock, and lots of lava—you'll know you're in the right place. Alongside the unique (and weirdly strong) fire frogs in these volcanic caves, the standard skeletons you'll be used to are now incandescent, which basically means…",

I've found that this has happened a lot in Arc Raiders , as players keep surprising me with how creative they can get when killing arcs and other raiders. When the deadline mine was first introduced into Arc Raiders, it created new opportunities for players to take out large arcs like Rocketeers or Bastions in one hit, provided they could get close enough to actually attach the mine first. But now players are taking it one step further, and attaching not only deadline mines to arcs but also fireworks with them. (Image credit: Embark) \"I thought it would be possible, so I tried\" were the words uttered by an ingenious Arc Raiders player. Alongside is a clip showing just how they managed to snap hook onto the back of a Rocketeer before attaching a box of fireworks to it. Only for the Rocketeer to fly off and then put on a little fireworks show over the ruins of Buried City. \"After this video, I repeated it on Spaceport night raid,\" the player continues. \"I put two fireworks, set them off and flew on it.
