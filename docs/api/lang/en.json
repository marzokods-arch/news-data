User Tkemalediction posted on the Google Home subreddit that all of their scripted automations (ones made using Google Home’s YAML script editor) that were working fine previously had stopped firing.

A new “Magnet Wireless Charger” (EP-P2900) has been spotted, and it could support up to 25W charging for the Ultra and 20W for the other S26 models. Older devices like the Galaxy S25 and Z Fold 7 will also work with this charger, though at reduced 15W speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to launch next month, and one of the key upgrades across the lineup is expected to be the presence of Qi2 magnets built into the phones themselves. This would allow the Galaxy S26 series to be immediately compatible with a wide range of MagSafe accessories. Samsung plans to launch its own magnet accessories, too. Samsung’s upcoming magnetic wireless charging power bank has been spotted before, and now Samsung’s upcoming magnetic wireless charger has been spotted as well.

Vivo and OPPO debuted these new-generation add-on lenses, which can dramatically improve long-range camera zoom. The Galaxy S7 phones supported a 2x add-on lens back in 2016, but the Galaxy maker hasn’t adopted these new lenses just yet. The vivo X200 Ultra was the first Android phone to offer the new generation of telephoto extender lenses , and subsequent vivo and OPPO flagships support these add-on lenses too. These accessories attach to the phone’s telephoto camera to improve long-range zoom. Now, Apple could also be testing this tech for the iPhone 18 Pro series. Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu reported that Apple is evaluating teleconverter lenses, with an accompanying hashtag suggesting that this could land on the iPhone 18 Pro series. Check out the machine-translated post below.",

Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

The ITF has approved various models of the WHOOP tracker for match use so long as haptic feedback is disabled, but Grand Slam events can impose additional rules independently. WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies.

Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now. After the Phone 4a and 4a Pro first appeared back in September , some of their specifications were tipped last month alongside hints of a new affordable headphone from the brand. A more recent leak now reveals the charging speed and the slightly increased battery capacity.",

McAfee wants to tackle this growing problem with a new update to its Scam Detector service. McAfee just announced big improvements to its Scam Detector tool, like instant QR code scam checks and better protection for social messaging apps. Now, instead of only reacting after a scam happens, the software helps right when you’re about to click, scan, or reply.

Amid a recent blitz of Galaxy S26 rumors and leaks, we’ve heard about color options a couple of times: first in the context of leaked images of the S26 Ultra’s SIM card tray , then in a second rumor that corroborated the colors from that initial leak while claiming the existence of two more. Today, though, we’ve got a conflicting report that lines up with the SIM card tray leak, but doesn’t mention the other colorways we heard about later. Leaker theonecid posted on Twitter today that the Galaxy S26 series will come in four colors: black, white, Cobalt Violet, and Sky Blue. Those are the same colors seen in images of the Ultra model’s SIM tray posted earlier this month by Ice Universe — but today’s post notably lacks the “silver shadow” and “pink gold” colorways leaker Evan Blass claimed would be available on the S26 Ultra last week.",

How much of your life have you lived with a smart speaker listening in on you? The original Google Home turns 10 later this year, and Amazon Echo’s been around even longer. For as convenient as this kind of smart home hardware can be, are we sacrificing too much of our privacy by having it around?

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A Redditor is building a new version of Snake for Galaxy Watch, and it already looks better than most Wear OS alternatives. Bezel controls and a circular playfield make it feel natural on a smartwatch. The game isn’t finished or publicly available yet, but it’s a promising proof of concept. Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

Update: January 27, 2026 (9:47 AM ET): A Google spokesperson has informed Android Authority that it’s unclear what the exact situation is for this specific user. However, YouTube users without Premium can still access playback speeds up to 2x and adjust the speed in 0.05 increments. Meanwhile, Premium users can play videos at speeds up to 4x. The spokesperson adds that the company often runs experiments to specifically highlight premium features to non-subscribers as a way to encourage trying out Premium. It’s possible this user may be seeing a prompt to sign up for Premium in order to use speeds above 2x.",

Without this fix, these devices would slowly break. Once the certificate expired, they’d lose access to Apple’s servers and core features. The update is about functional life support, not new features; devices remain on old iOS 12 and many modern apps won’t work. Supporting a smartphone for more than a decade sounds almost impossible with how quickly new models come out these days, as in the case of Android models . But this week, Apple did just that by releasing a software update for iPhones that were first released more than 10 years ago. Apple has quietly released iOS 12.5.8, a surprise update for legacy hardware that can’t run modern versions of iOS, as spotted by a Reddit user . This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, the original iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 and 3, and even the sixth-generation iPod touch.",

The project has garnered significant attention from a viral Tweet on Monday. The tool is not yet finished, but the goal is similar to other projects like N64: Recompiled. While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday. Although it’s far from being finished, the goal is to statically recompile PS2 games into modern C++. Combined with the right renderer, this code can then be turned into a native PC port with significantly better performance than any traditional emulator can offer.",

We’ve previously spotted Google working on a new UI for Google Wallet , one that better accommodates your favorite passes for quicker access.

    "body": "TL;DR Belkin will shut down its Wemo cloud service for smart home devices later this week. Around two dozen devices are at risk of going obsolete, but you might be eligible for a partial refund if you bought them recently. However, if your device supports Apple HomeKit or Thread, it is immune to the shutdown. The shutdown date for Belkin’s Wemo smart home app is almost upon us. On January 31, 2026, Wemo’s cloud service will be shuttered, and any devices that run on it will effectively be turned into dumb devices (if they can still function, as with light bulbs). Therefore, Belkin is sending final reminders to owners and telling them they may be eligible for refunds in certain cases. After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed. In its email to existing users, Belkin also notes that while its Wemo cloud interface is shutting down, devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit or Thread’s IoT protocol will continue to work through their respective services.",

The way it’s progressing, Google will soon know when your meeting is before you do. Back in October, it introduced the Help me schedule feature , which helped you suggest sensible meeting times based on your availability and the context of an email. That was useful, but it still left you to find out if the time worked for the other party. This latest update takes a bigger step by figuring out when everyone is actually free. According to a new Google Workspace update , Google is rolling out smarter suggested meeting times directly inside Google Calendar. When you’re creating an event, you’ll see a Suggested times option that uses Gemini to scan attendee availability, working hours, and existing conflicts, then surface the time slots that make the most sense for the whole group — assuming you have access to those calendars.

If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before.

You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",

There are many reasons for this shift. Some feel Verizon has dropped the ball when it comes to network quality and performance, but there have also been staff cuts, inconsistent promises, and other issues.

    "body": "Credit: Apple TL;DR Apple has announced a new AirTag with a longer Precision Finding range, improved Bluetooth detection, and a much louder built-in speaker. The updated AirTag also adds Precision Finding support on Apple Watch, making it easier to track items without pulling out your phone. Pricing stays the same as before, starting at $29 for one AirTag or $99 for a four-pack. After last month’s leak pointing to a long-overdue refresh, Apple has officially unveiled a new version of its AirTag tracker. While it has been referred to as the “AirTag 2” in the past, Apple isn’t using that name. This is simply the new AirTag, and it’s focused on a more extended range, easier findability, and tighter integration with Apple’s ecosystem. According to the Apple Newsroom , the updated AirTag offers a significantly improved Precision Finding experience thanks to the company’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. Apple says you can now locate an AirTag from up to 50% farther away than before, while an upgraded Bluetooth chip also extends the range at which nearby devices can help detect it through the Find My network.",

Customers should always use company websites or official stores on marketplaces like Amazon or AliExpress. Despite their somewhat legally dubious origins, Android gaming handheld makers have taken a lot of steps toward legitimacy in recent years. The big players, like Retroid, AYN, and AYANEO, don’t ship devices with any copyrighted material, and most now offer some sort of warranty on products. However, that hasn’t stopped scams from popping up in other parts of the web, prompting AYN to send out a warning message this morning. The company writes that it has received reports of unaffiliated websites selling its products online. These range from overpriced resellers to outright scams, and the company warns that it “cannot guarantee any sort of protection if you purchase from non-AYN sites.” The company also notes that only emails from addresses ending in @ayn.hk are official AYN staff members.",
