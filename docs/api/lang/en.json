Related Here Are the 2026 Grammys Winners: Full List (Updating&nbsp;Live) It’s fitting that Spielberg clinched EGOT status as a producer of a film about John Williams because the two men have been close collaborators for more than 50 years. Williams has won four of his five Oscars for scoring Spielberg films: Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. &#8211; The Extra-Terrestrial and Schindler’s List. Only 22 people have achieved EGOT status, which has become the ultimate mic-drop&nbsp;move in show business. If the original idea of becoming an EGOT meant going to the very top in four distinct fields of entertainment, shortcuts have materialized to getting there, which has made the achievement more commonplace and less worthy of awe. The Tonys dole out producer credits&nbsp; far too liberally .&nbsp;Both Spielberg and&nbsp; Jennifer Hudson &nbsp;won their Tony Awards for being among more than 40 producers on the 2022 Broadway musical,&nbsp; A Strange Loop .

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. A specific launch date will depend on overall spacecraft traffic at the orbital outpost and other planning considerations. “The International Space Station is a critical platform for enabling commercial industry in low Earth orbit,” said Dana Weigel, manager, International Space Station Program, NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Private astronaut missions allow the station to be used as a proving ground for new markets and technologi…",

Goldstone is part of NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN), which operates three complexes around the globe that support communications with dozens of deep space missions. The DSN is NASA’s international array of giant radio antennas that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions, plus a few that orbit Earth. The DSN also provides radar and radio astronomy observations that improve our understanding of the solar system and the larger universe. Through&nbsp;Artemis, NASA is establishing an enduring presence in space and exploring more of the Moon than ever before. To achieve this, Artemis missions rely on both the Deep Space Network and the Near Space Network . These networks, with oversight by NASA’s SCaN ( Space Communications and Navigation ) Program office, use global infrastructure and relay satellites to ensure seamless communications and tracking as Orion launches, orbits Earth, travels to the Moon, and returns home.
