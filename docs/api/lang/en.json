    "body": "Last month, OpenAI published a usage study showing that nearly 15 percent of work-related conversations on ChatGPT had to deal with \"making decisions and solving problems.\" Now comes word that at least one high-level member of the US military is using LLMs for the same purpose. At the Association of the US Army Conference in Washington, DC, this week, Maj. Gen. William \"Hank\" Taylor reportedly said that \"Chat and I are really close lately,\" using a distressingly familiar diminutive nickname to refer to an unspecified AI chatbot. \"AI is one thing that, as a commander, it’s been very, very interesting for me.\" Military-focused news site DefenseScoop reports that Taylor told a roundtable group of reporters that he and the Eighth Army he commands out of South Korea are \"regularly using\" AI to modernize their predictive analysis for logistical planning and operational purposes. That is helpful for paperwork tasks like \"just being able to write our weekly reports and things,\" Taylor said, but it also aids in informing their overall direction. Read full article Comments",

Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.” Read full article Comments",

F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years . Unprecedented During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks. Read ful…",

    "body": "On Wednesday, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, a small AI language model that reportedly delivers performance similar to what its frontier model Claude Sonnet 4 achieved five months ago but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users. If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable. As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called distillation , companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.

    "body": "Rejecting opposition from the cable and real estate industries, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that aims to increase broadband competition in apartment buildings. The new law taking effect on January 1 says landlords must let tenants \"opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy.\" It was approved by the state Assembly in a 75–0 vote in April, and by the Senate in a 30–7 vote last month. \"This is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly,\" Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democratic lawmaker who authored the bill, told Ars last month . \"It's not super restrictive. We are not banning bulk billing. We're not even limiting how much money the people can make. What we're saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement, they should be allowed to opt out.\" Read full article Comments",

AutoPacific spoke to 18,000 people who said they were planning to buy or lease a new car within the next three years for its 2025 Future Attribution Demand Study, and the company has been releasing snippets of data as it analyzes them, ahead of the full report's release later this year. There has already been at least one surprise. Last year , partially automated driving systems like General Motors' Super Cruise or Ford's BlueCruise, or those developed by Tesla , were not in high demand. This year, that tech went to the top of the most-wanted list, with 43 percent of consumers saying they want hands-free partial automation. The same percentage also indicated a demand for rear automatic emergency braking. Wireless device charging, No. 1 in the list in 2024, didn't make the top 15 for 2025. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "It's getting harder to know what's real on the Internet, and Google is not helping one bit with the announcement of Veo 3.1 . The company's new video model supposedly offers better audio and realism, along with greater prompt accuracy. The updated video AI will be available throughout the Google ecosystem, including the Flow filmmaking tool, where the new model will unlock additional features. And if you're worried about the cost of conjuring all these AI videos, Google is also adding a \"Fast\" variant of Veo. Veo made waves when it debuted earlier this year , demonstrating a staggering improvement in AI video quality just a few months after Veo 2's release. It turns out that having all that video on YouTube is very useful for training AI models, so Google is already moving on to Veo 3.1 with a raft of new features. Google says Veo 3.1 offers stronger prompt adherence, which results in better video outputs and fewer wasted compute cycles. Audio, which was a hallmark feature of the Veo 3 release, has reportedly improved, too. Veo 3's text-to-video was limited to 720p landscape output, but there's an ever-increasing volume of vertical video on the Internet. So Veo 3.1 can produce bot…",

The announcement follows OpenAI's recent hint that it would allow developers to create \"mature\" ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls. Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\" but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot \"less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.\" The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allo…",

    "body": "A couple of weeks ago, a YouTuber unboxed what appeared to be a refreshed iPad Pro in full retail packaging, suggesting it would be launching imminently. Today, Apple formally announced the new tablets, and it looks like pretty much everything uncovered by that YouTuber turned out to be accurate. The new iPad Pros, powered by Apple's also-new M5 chip, use the same basic designs as the M4 iPad Pros from last year and are compatible with the same cases and accessories. The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model, is available for pre-order today , and ships on October 22. Apple's M5 is similar in composition to the M4—the fully enabled version uses four high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency CPU cores, 10 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. But a memory bandwidth increase, from 120GB/s for the M4 to 153GB/s for the M5, enables a 30 percent improvement in GPU performance and a 45 percent increase to ray-traced graphics performance, according to Apple's estimates. Apple's press release also highlighted improvements to storage performance, with \"up to 2x faster storage read and write speeds.\" Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Apple often releases a smaller second wave of new products in October after the dust settles from its September iPhone announcement, and this year that wave revolves around its brand-new M5 chip . The first Mac to get the new processor will be the new 14-inch MacBook Pro , which the company announced today on its press site alongside a new M5 iPad Pro and an updated version of the Vision Pro headset. But unlike the last couple MacBook Pro refreshes, Apple isn't ready with Pro and Max versions of the M5 for higher-end 14-inch MacBook Pros and 16-inch MacBook Pros. Those models will continue to use the M4 Pro and M4 Max for now, and we probably shouldn't expect an update for them until sometime next year. Aside from the M5, the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro has essentially identical specs to the outgoing M4 version. It has a notched 14-inch screen with ProMotion support and a 3024×1964 resolution, three USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a 12 MP Center Stage webcam. It still weighs 3.4 pounds, and Apple still estimates the battery should last for \"up to 16 hours\" of wireless web browsing and up to 24 hours of video streaming.

CEO Tim Cook called it \"the beginning of a new era for computing,\" placing the Vision Pro in the same industry-shifting echelon as the Mac and the iPhone. The Vision Pro could still eventually lead to a product that ushers in a new age of \"spatial computing.\" But it does seem like Apple is a bit less optimistic about the headset's current form—at least, that's one possible way to read the fact that the second-generation Vision Pro is being announced via press release, rather than as the centerpiece of a product event. The new Vision Pro is available for the same $3,499 as the first model, which will likely continue to limit the headset's appeal outside of a die-hard community of early adopters and curious developers. It's available for pre-order today and ships on October 22. Read full article Comments",

    "body": "Here at Ars, we have been writing about rumors of a portable Xbox for literal decades now . With the ROG Xbox Ally, Microsoft has finally made those rumors a reality in the weirdest, most Microsoft way possible. Yes, the $600 ROG Xbox Ally—and its souped-up cousin, the $1,000, ridiculous-mouthful-of-a-name ROG Xbox Ally X, which we tested—are the first official handheld hardware to sport the Xbox brand name. But Microsoft isn’t taking the exclusive-heavy , walled garden software approach that it has been committed to for nearly 25 years of Xbox home consoles. Instead, the ROG Xbox Ally is, at its base, simply a new version of Asus’ Windows-based ROG Ally line with an Xbox-flavored coat of paint. That coat of paint—what Microsoft is calling the Xbox Full-screen Experience (FSE)—represents the company’s belated attempt to streamline the Windows gaming experience to be a bit more console-like in terms of user interface and overall simplicity. While that’s a worthy vision, the execution in these early days is so spotty and riddled with annoyances that it’s hard to recommend over the SteamOS-based competition. Read full article Comments",

Some reports said it was a dangerous fuel leak aboard the vessel, which was commissioned in 2012.\" France 24 quoted further social media reports as saying, \"The submarine has neither the spare parts nor the qualified specialists onboard to fix the malfunction,\" and it \"now poses an explosion hazard.\" Read full article Comments",

DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices' screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default. When the new screensavers launch, Glance's AI content will show if the TV is idle for 10 minutes, The Verge reported. Read full article Comments",
