With 5,700 ISO lumens, it’s bright enough to hold its own against daylight or a well-lit living room.

Configurations range from 8GB/128GB up to an Ultra model with 24GB RAM and 1TB storage. The Indiegogo page is live for sign-ups and early-bird discounts, but there’s no pricing or release date yet. It’s only been a couple of days since AYN confirmed the Odin 3 will be the first Android handheld powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. That alone will make it one of the most powerful handhelds on the market. The company has now followed up by posting the full spec sheet and launching the Indiegogo campaign page. The Odin 3 specs, which were shared on Discord and via @Ayn_Loki on X , partly confirm what we already knew — the device will ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 6-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, and an 8,000mAh battery. However, it also fleshes out the different configurations. You’ll be able to pick from models with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at the entry level, right up to an Ultra version with a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That last option wasn’t even in the original plan but was added after fans in the AYN Discord pushed for it.",

    "body": "Credit: Mahmoud Itani / Android Authority ChatGPT has quickly turned into one of the most visited websites on the internet, and it’s not hard to see why. The chatbot can write essays, brainstorm ideas, and even generate code, making it an important resource that many now rely on. But what if it’s not working for you? For those unfortunate times when ChatGPT is down, we’ve put together a list of potential solutions you can try to get it running again. Check if ChatGPT is down Give ChatGPT some time to recover Check your internet connection Log out and log back in Try incognito mode or a different browser Use the ChatGPT smartphone app Clear your browser’s settings and cache Try a ChatGPT alternative Check if ChatGPT is down The first thing you should do is check if the servers hosting ChatGPT itself are down right now or facing connectivity issues. Such disruptions were common in the early days of the service, as the company struggled to meet the ever-increasing user demand.",

A federal court ruled that the company would not be forced to break up key parts of its business, which included avoiding the sale of both Chrome and Android. According to the ruling from the US District Court for the District of Columbia, “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment.” The court also confirmed that “Google will not have to present users with choice screens on its products or encourage its Android distribution partners to do the same.”",
