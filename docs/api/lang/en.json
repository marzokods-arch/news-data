A decade later, the Pilots hadn&#8217;t matched that crossover success on either chart, with no additional top five singles and a number of top five albums, but no subsequent number ones. That is, until this week. On the Billboard 200 dated Sept. 27, the duo&#8217;s latest set Breach — marking the apparently final entry in the decade-long narrative the group started with Blurryface — bows at No. 1.

How did the duo manage this performance? And what other rock acts could rival that number in the years to come? Billboard writers answer these questions and more below. 1.
