The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

Specifically, the AI app was getting support for audio file uploads . Fast forward to today, and the function is now live on Android, iOS, and on the web. On social media, Josh Woodward , VP of Google Labs and Gemini, announced that users can now upload any file to the Gemini app. According to Woodward, this also includes the number one request — audio files.

The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

It might not be everyone’s preferred third-party launcher these days, but it’s been my pick for as long as I can remember. As someone who swaps phones regularly, Nova has been my consistent home base in a sea of OEM homescreens, some good but many far less so. Whether it’s setting my preferred app drawer layout or augmenting icons with custom gestures, Nova has usually exceeded the capabilities of stock launchers, which is reason enough to be upset at its demise.",

The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leaks continue to stream in, and we recently saw camera specs surface online . Now, a trusted leaker has revealed even more details about the Ultra phone’s camera hardware. Tipster Ice Universe has claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 50MP 5x camera will have an f/2.9 aperture. That’s significantly wider than the S25 Ultra’s f/3.4 shooter.

The new lens supposedly has a narrower f/2.8 aperture, a downgrade from the OnePlus 13’s f/2.6 aperture. Another possible leak suggests the OnePlus 15 might be cheaper due to cost-cutting measures, including a different display and the end of the Hasselblad partnership. OnePlus makes some excellent Android flagships , and the current generation OnePlus 13 checks all the right boxes, so we’re very excited to see what the company has in store for its successor, the OnePlus 15 (Chinese culture regards the number “4” as unlucky). The company recently confirmed that its Hasselblad partnership is over, and that it is building its own DetailMax Engine for photography. Now, more specifications of the OnePlus 15’s camera have leaked, and there’s both good and bad news. Leaker Digital Chat Station has shared that the OnePlus 15 could come with a 50MP periscope telephoto camera. This camera could have an 85mm equivalent focal length and f/2.8 aperture.",

Reddit user Qowudyeibflsla (via 9to5Google ) recently spotted the upcoming Nest indoor and outdoor cameras, along with the latest smart doorbell, at Home Depot. While the new products appear identical to the older ones, Google is emphasizing their ability to record at 2K resolution by specifying that as part of the branding.",

From the camera to the notes app and elsewhere, the pitch is clear. This isn’t just another smartphone. Instead, it’s a showcase for how Google’s AI strategy ties directly to its hardware. But while the on-device LLM can do a lot, when it comes to heavy lifting, Google wants you to pop over into the Gemini app. More specifically, Gemini Pro . And to drive that point further, Google bundles in a free year of the Gemini AI Pro plan with the phone. The perk is designed to funnel you into recurring payments, and storage is the bait. In fact, I’d go as far as saying that the free year of Gemini Pro and 2TB of cloud storage are a key part of Google’s marketing to make the phone appear like a bargain. Two terabytes of cloud storage, access to Google’s best AI features, including Deep Research with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Add to that AI-enabled extras in access to AI filmmaking tools via Flow, image to video creation, and a 1000 monthly AI credits.

Giving consumers more control over their internet experience is definitely the way to go. However, I find it a somewhat pointless addition to a tool I use to find a variety of sources and not merely highlight my favorites. Beyond Search, I argue that two other Google products would benefit from Preferred Sources: News and Discover. I’ve spent much time trying to shape Google’s content delivery and discovery platforms to meet my needs. And despite my best efforts, some of which I’ve documented , News and Discover continue to serve me low-grade content regularly. Do you really want me to click on an article with an AI-generated rendering of two fantasy phones posing as breaking news, Google? I’m genuinely not so sure anymore.",

Initially, it was mostly curiosity and tinkering. That changed over time. Today, self-hosting for me is equal parts habit, convenience, and once-in-a-while stubbornness to stick with open-source solutions. But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

This leak comes from the same X (formerly Twitter) user who released last week’s animations, @TechHighest . In this particular video, we see how the Galaxy foldable will open and close.

Samsung’s top-end foldable might come with a heavy price tag, but that hasn’t stopped demand from forcing the company to build more. Samsung has reportedly raised its September production target for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to 260,000 units, 60,000 more than planned. According to Korean outlet The Elec , Samsung also overshot its August plan by a wide margin. Output for the Fold 7 hit 430,000 units last month, compared to the 170,000 units penciled in two months earlier and the 320,000 the company settled on just before launch.",
