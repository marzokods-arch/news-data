One techie recently took to Reddit to share that they had turned the guts of an old optical mouse into a tiny little camera that can fit into a palm. It reportedly took 65 hours to create, but actually, that project was in the works for much longer. Dycus, the creator behind the project, told me the idea originally came from this SpritesMods post detailing the ways you can use the optical mouse sensor like a very small camera. They spotted this report \"many, many years ago\", but it stayed in the back of their mind for some time. They kept the PCB and sensor from an old, broken Logitech G400 mouse, should such a day arrive where they can put what they've learned into practice. \"Many years after that… I was digging through a box looking for something, when I found this board, and the \"new project itch\" struck.\" Dycus told me that, earlier this year, they became \"interested in my old Game Boy Camera Again\", and the project took shape.

    "body": "If you've just bought a new ultrawide monitor or invested in a top-end headset for some serious VR action, one of the graphics settings you've probably tried changing in games is the field of view. What you've also probably noticed is that opening up the view to make things more immersive just ruins the visual experience. The good news is that one UK team reckons it's cracked the problem, and it's already made the tools for game devs. Human vision has a horizontal field of view of around 200 degrees or so, but the vast majority of 3D games stick with 75 to 90 degrees. Many will let you play around with an FOV (field of view) setting, but once you go over 100, the edges go all kinds of wonky. It is possible, of course, to code a game so that it doesn't do this, but it's easier said than done. That's because while it's a piece of cake to increase the horizontal size of the frustrum created by the camera in a 3D world, objects at the edge of the FOV will look distorted and stretched unless this is all accounted for and corrected. And what might work fine at 110 degrees, for a game that's normally 90 degrees, might not work very well at higher FOV values. Enter stage left, Fovo Techno…",

No, I'm serious, after the last delay, it seems like everyone went through all the stages of grief and has reached acceptance , or near enough: \"Nothing wrong with delaying a game. Nothing at all. But why keep giving dates with so much confidence when they know it needs more time to polish?\" (Image credit: Rockstar) But among fans trying to rationalise another delay, there are others within the gaming industry sharing support , thinly-veiled threats , and even some theories about the breaking GTA 6 news. \"Interestingly, just a little industry knowledge for all you gamers, a Nov 19 launch puts them outside the nomination window for most game awards in 2026,\" Palworld's communications director, Bucky, says in a social media post . \"Intentional or…?

Arc's relatively peaceful game world (not counting all the damn robots) has thus come as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and instead of getting mad and going back to Find My Frogs after an hour or two, I'm thoroughly hooked. I had just one problem: The sound in Arc Raiders would persistently hiccup and hitch, and the troubles would get worse the longer I played. After three or four matches, the audio would drop out for a full second or two, intermittently but repeatedly, multiple times per minute. The game continued to run normally, to be clear, it was just dead silent. The effect was incredibly distracting and irritating, and for a game as dependent on audio cues as Arc Raiders, it was a deal breaker: I was ready to quit playing if I couldn't find a fix. Fortunately, I did find a fix. A search through the Steam forums revealed that I was far from alone in struggling with this issue, which made me feel slightly better about things—misery and company, and all that.

Surviving Mars comfortably slots into the first group, but given the original's relative youth, you could be forgiven for assuming it's part of the latter. Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive released the original Surviving Mars back in 2018. In my Surviving Mars review , I said it was \"a lot of hard work, but managing a burgeoning colony never stops being compelling\", and then slapped an 80% on it. Thanks to the DLC, we were then able to keep expanding our colonies with new features all the way up to 2022. (Image credit: Paradox) This is not an ageing classic, then. Nor has its relevance diminished. Survival city builders are even more popular than they were when Surviving Mars first launched, and the fantasy of colonising Mars is as zeitgeisty as ever. It largely feels as fresh as it did back in 2018. Yes, it launched during a previous console generation, but it's compatible with PS5 and Xbo…",

But I still consider myself a fan of the Mafia series and, indeed, of Hangar 13 as a studio—it proved it can put out a game I love with Mafia 3 (and an idea I love with Rhapsody , its sadly canned post-Mafia-3 project), and I want to see more from both. So, regardless of my cold feelings toward the game, I'm glad to hear The Old Country did well enough to appease Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K's parent company, Take-Two. Zelnick told The Game Business that Mafia: The Old Country's sales had surpassed Take-Two's internal expectations—though he didn't say what those expectations were—and that \"What we suspected was confirmed.\" What did Zelnick and company suspect? \"If you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.\" Which sounds to me like Take-Tw…",

More often than not, it's nothing more than a dead, dried-out plant rolling on by without a care in the world—completely oblivious to the fact that I either just shat my pants or was prepared to unload a full mag on it.

The MX Master 4 is taller at its peak, for a start. It's also a touch longer, a touch chonkier, and now comes with a substantial rounded ridge along the left side where the horizontal scroll wheel resides. The main buttons feel different, too, as they're now nestled inside a semi-translucent coating that strikes as one of the more bizarre additions I could think of adding to a mouse redesign. It's like they're trapped in some sort of see-thru amber, which means if you hold the mouse up to the light, you can see through the tips. If you keep your mouse on your desk, however, like some sort of norm-o-human, I doubt you'll ever notice. What you will notice, however, is the texture of the coating, which seems designed to prevent sweaty fingers from slipping around under some heavy click…",

That didn't affect me, but this does, therefore it's bad. That's a valid argument, trust me, I did logic 101. You see, I considered upgrading my entire build a few months ago, but I put it off because the start of a new GPU generation isn't my favourite time to upgrade. So I came up with my cunning plan: I would wait until next year when hopefully RTX 50-series Super cards launch, and then I'd pounce. And I'd have the benefit of cheaper prices across the board by then, too. I can hear you snickering from here. 'Cheaper prices', I know. I've been foiled by the tumultuous tides of today's AI-first tech industry and resultant memory shortage. My current build, if you're wondering, consists of an RTX 3060 Ti, Core i5 12600KF, and 32 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM. And that's 3200 MT/s RAM that really cannot hit those speeds, at least not paired w…",

Instead of stumbling around Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Buried City, here's exactly where you need to go to complete each step of Greasing Her Palms. Take note that you'll need to hang onto the Dam Surveillance Key that Celeste gives you upon accepting this quest because you'll need it to complete the relevant objective. How to complete Greasing Her Palms in Arc Raiders You'll need to visit three specific locations across three different maps for Greasing Her Palms, which'll take you quite some time.

So it's only natural that you'd do exactly the same as one Redditor did, and try to get it to run Cyberpunk 2077. Well, they did more than just try ; they actually succeeded. In a post on Reddit , user Retrotom explains the steps they followed to get Nvidia's DGX Spark to natively run Cyberpunk 2077. The little 'AI-supercomputer-in-a-box' sports a GB10 APU, which has a 20-core Arm CPU and a Blackwell-based GPU with 6,144 shader cores. Cyberpunk 2077 runs on DGX Spark from r/nvidia The latter is, to all intents and purposes, the same GPU that's in a GeForce RTX 5070 . Same number of shaders, TMUs, ROPs, ray tracing units, tensor cores, and L2 cache. Where they differ is in VRAM and power. While the GB10 sports 128 GB of LPDDR5x unified memory across a 256-bit wide memory bus for 273 GB/s of bandwidth, the GB205 in the RTX 5070 is home to 12 GB of GDDR7. AI models need lots of RAM, which is why the DGX Spark is so heavily loaded compared to the graphics card, but as the RTX 5070 is for gaming, it us…",

That's just the kind of world we live in now. As an acknowledgement of this change, Collins Dictionary has awarded the term Word of the Year, despite, well, being two words. This week, Collins Dictionary posted a blog celebrating and explaining its choice for the Word of the Year (via The Register ). Vibe coding is relatively contentious in itself. Generative AI has been widely criticised for flagrantly ignoring copyright and for its adoption by investors declaring it's the next big thing in games, movies, or whatever art form you hold dear. And that's because there are productivity gains to be made in skipping through all the manual work of creative labour. Of course, that comes with its own set of problems. An overreliance on the black box that is generative AI can make coders less able to actually fix their own problems when they inevitably pop up. As well as this, we've seen stories of AI coding tools 'panicking' and destroying entire databases , and coding assistants being vulnerable to targeted attacks . That is to sa…",

From the get-go, Arc Raiders has had expensive skins, with some going as high as $24/£20 and the average sitting around $20/£15. Now, this may not seem like a lot compared to games like Valorant, League of Legends, or even Overwatch 2, but Arc Raiders isn't a free-to-play game, so these charges are on top of the $40/£30 game price. (Image credit: Embark) It's an issue many players aren't willing to sweep under the rug: \"Bro, how are you gonna just shrug at $25 skin bundles in a $40 game? That's unacceptable.\" While another player points out , \"Those skin prices are kinda...brutal. And to add to that, we still have gameplay affecting items in the battlepass, in a $40 game.\" The discontent with how Embark is pricing their cosmetics has clearly been spreading for some time now, with the latest store update sparking an even angrier reaction from fans. 📡Store updateWhether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.The Le…",

However, the findings of one US repair shop suggest that this might not be the case, because at least two Corsair models don't have all of the fixes, and there's no way for owners to apply them. That's according to Matt's Computer Services on YouTube, which says that a $5,000 Corsair gaming rig, with a Core i7 14700KF, had been submitted to the repair shop three times, due to crashing in games. The host of the video explains that, having gone through every possible check and attempt at solving the problem (including usual things such as reinstalling Windows and trying a more powerful PSU), the issues persisted. It was only when they delved into the motherboard's BIOS that the penny finally dropped. The pre-built in question is using an Asus Prime Z790-P motherboard, updated to Corsair's most recent BIOS for it (version 9046). The video highlights the fact that this firmware is using Intel's 0x12B microcode, which it released i…",

Trials provides more challenges for players to complete during excursions, like damaging Hornets, searching new wave husks, or destroying Ticks, Fireballs, and Pops, alongside the quests that different raiders from Speranza give you. For each challenge, there are three milestones at 1,000 points, 2,500 points, and 4,000 points, and each milestone will reward you with a better mystery prize. (Image credit: Embark Studios) At first, I thought that these were easier quests that I could simply tick off my to-do list without thinking too much about it, and while challenges at the lower levels aren't too difficult, it often takes a dedicated run to complete them.

I've combed over the test results here repeatedly over the last week, and well, to say this isn't the best gaming laptop , is an understatement. Quite the damning opening paragraph that, especially as a hardware journalist with a reputation to uphold and all, but here me out. I've got beef, and it's with TGP, or total graphics power. This here is the Gigabyte Aero X16 Copilot. A quick glance down the specs list, and you'll see it's brimming with some seriously impressive hardware, or so it would seem anyway. There's one of AMD's latest Ryzen AI 7 350 CPUs based on the Krackan Point architecture, a healthy dose of 32 GB DDR5 clocking in at 5,600 MT/s, a nice 1 TB helping of PCIe 4.0 SSD storage, and perhaps more importantly for this whimsical argument, an RTX 5070 8 GB mobile GPU. But there's a catch: it's limited to just 85 W. That's the same 85 W power limit Gigabyte placed on its Gaming A16 I tested earlier this year as well, with its RTX 5060.

Well, quite hard, as chances are you weren't searching for something that looks like a bin half-buried in sand. The good news is that Marano Station is one of the best loot spots , though you wouldn't guess it based on how quiet and unassuming the area is. So while you're picking up the Marano Station cache to complete Market Correction, why not loot a few things too? How to complete Market Correction in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Embark) You can find the cache behind a small metal building at the north end of Marano Station in Buried City, by the car park. It basically looks like two trash cans tied together , which isn't quite what you'd expect a cache to look like, but it is easy to spot once you know. Once you've found the cache, simply interact with it to investigate and sabotage it to complete the Market Correction quest. You don't need to extract with an item or anything like that, so don't worry about escaping alive. Given how quiet Marano Statio…",

The recent claim that Nvidia will cancel its forthcoming GeForce RTX 50 Super series due to memory shortages is a prime example.

Oh, and the current cards will get a lot more expensive for good measure, too.

For the level two Refiner, you'll not only need three toasters, but also five Arc motion cores and eight fireball burners .

For studios planning a November 2026 launch, that nightmare became reality today when Take-Two announced a new delay . GTA 6 was originally slated to release on consoles in Fall 2025—around now!—before its initial delay to May 2026. If you look at the major games releasing in May 2026 as of now, you'll notice there's basically nothing because everything is shambling to escape Rockstar's orbit. And while it's true that May isn't usually a busy month for blockbuster game releases, in 2025 we saw Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet hit PC, both of which would be cremated alive in a battle against GTA. Speaking anonymously to The Game Business on the announcement of GTA 6's first delay , the \"boss of one of the world's biggest game publishers\" admitted that Rockstar sucks a lot of money and time out of the market and that \"we don't want to be anywhere near that.\" Another anonymous s…",

It clarified a few basic things, like being able to buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance (and therefore with in-game gold via WoW tokens) and that it intends to keep the catalog small compared to what you can earn by playing the game. \"Housing items tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop,\" it says. \"Thematically important decor that players know and love will also not appear in the shop.\" Then it went on to explain why it's adding a premium currency in the first place, especially when it already sells mounts and cosmetics for real money values.

Despite it being in early access, and despite having only played for about 8 hours, I've already fallen head over heels for it.

    "body": "Starbreeze recently handed Payday 2 off to a new studio , Sidetrack Games, so it can focus its efforts on salvaging the mess that is Payday 3 . Whether Payday 3 can be saved is a wide open question, but as a new trailer for an entirely different game makes painfully clear, it sure doesn't look good right now. The trailer in question is for update 18 of Crime Boss: Rockay City , and we might as well get this out of the way first: Yes, Crime Boss: Rockay City has had 18 updates since it launched in June 2024, yes it's still running, and yes, people are still playing it—not many people, no, but some. (More on this later.) Its continuing survival is notable because Rockay City brings a genuinely impressive cast of C-tier celebrities to the table—Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Michael Rooker, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, Kim Basinger, and Vanilla Ice—and yet is one of the most utterly mid-tier, 'why did they make this' videogames ever. It's not flat-out bad, mind, but as PC Gamer editor Wes Fenlon put it in a 2023 preview , Rockay City feels like the kind of game Uwe Boll would've turned into a movie.\" Anyway, back to the trailer: It looks like a fairly straight-ahead gameplay trailer, wi…",

And if you don't have time for this ol' TV nonsense, I highly recommend checking out her podcasts, like Why Won't You Date Me? and Newcomers.

For starters, the Minisforum MS-R1 runs a Cixin P1 CPU . It's a Chinese made chip built on 6 nm technology and configured with eight Cortex A720 performance and four Cortex A520 efficiency cores. In other words, we're talking off-the-shelf Arm cores first introduced in 2023 and part of Arm's mid-range Cortex A700 range, which is more about efficient mobility than outright performance. Arm's Cortex X900 series and, soon, the C1 Ultra, represent Arm's most performant cores of the moment. This is also a compact machine. So, even with that full physical x16 graphics slot, you're not going to be fitting an RTX 5090. Even a mid-range GPU probably won't fit. The slot is also limited to eight PCIe Gen 4 lanes, electrically, which is arguably suboptimal, even if, in reality, that's u…",

That's because the SST-FLP02 is as close to a PC case from the late 1980s, early 1990s, as you could possibly get, without trawling through eBay to source a genuine one. We first laid eyes on it back in May , at the annual Computex event, but it's now officially on the market, with an asking price of $240 . I know that's a lot of money to spend on a case, but to be fair to SilverStone, it's a niche product that isn't going to shift in enormous quantities. Low-volume sellers nearly always sport high price tags to make them financially viable for the manufacturer. So what exactly are you getting for your two hundred and forty dollars?

Sure, you could still keep playing as his son Jack, but the guy you'd come to know and love over tens of hours of playtime was cold in the ground. It hit like a sledgehammer, and it's still tough to play through the game's ending even now. Turns out, though, that Rockstar would have liked to subject you to that emotional trauma even earlier. In a chat with Lex Fridman , Rockstar co-founder (who has since departed the company) Dan Houser said that he would've really liked to break your heart in GTA 4. \"I would like to have, at the end of GTA 4, killed Niko,\" said Houser, with what I can only describe as a bit too much relish.

How to complete A Reveal in Ruins in Arc Raiders Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 3 Piazza Arbutso pharmacy (Image credit: Embark) Image 3 of 3 Plaza Rosa pharmacy (Image credit: Embark) There are two pharmacies in Buried City that can contain the ESR Analyser for this quest. Both buildings have \"Farmacia\" ('pharmacy' in Italian) signs above the door and a green cross sign, too, so it's not hard to recognise them: One pharmacy is next to the metro stairs at Piazza Arbutso The other is in the top right …",

    "body": "Arc Raiders has heaps of random junk for you to collect, as well as more practical items like guns, shields, and keys, but they've all got their uses one way or another. The biggest sink for all these bits and bobs is undoubtedly the Expedition Project, which overshadows even donating all the resources for workbench and Scrappy upgrades. While it's far from ideal for casual players who simply want to reset their tree, the Expedition Project is a smart approach to the controversial wipes mechanics of other extraction shooters. For the unaware, the Expeditions system is basically Arc Raiders' answer to hardcore players asking for regular account wipes. It's voluntary, unlike in Escape from Tarkov, but it'll reset pretty much all of your progression and effectively retire your character, letting you create a new raider and start from scratch every eight or so weeks. It's like prestige mode in Call of Duty. The issue many are running into is that, without a respec option, sending your character on an Expedition is the only way to reset your skill tree if you didn't go for the best skills —not helped by the fact that most Mobility skills don't work how you think they do .

If you listened to a very particular crowd back when it was revealed the game would feature Yasuke, a real historical figure who's been referenced a whole bunch in Japanese media anyway, you'd have thought it was the end of days. Initially, Ubisoft tried to mollify said crowd , calm them down which… Well, it went about as well as you'd expect. The sky didn't fall. What actually happened was that the game sold pretty well as an entertaining open world romp, and we all moved on with our lives. In other words, Ubisoft made an Ubisoft game . Nothing exploded because a Black samurai was in it. Gaming survived. Part of why Shadows' release was uneventful was, in part, because of Ubisoft's sudden pivot to, essentially, ' stop feeding the trolls .' Speaking at a BAFTA event last year, former franchise head Marc-Alexis Coté put his foot down: \"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and t…",
