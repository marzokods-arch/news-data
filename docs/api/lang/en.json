Within the traditional Big Four categories — record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist — Interscope led all record labels with eight nominees among the 32 slots, giving parent company Universal Music Group (UMG) a commanding 21 of those 32 nods. What’s more, Interscope’s leadership structure means its total is even higher: Interscope Capitol Labels Group (ICLG) includes Capitol (two nominations), Motown (two nominations) and the joint HYBE/Geffen partnership that signed KATSEYE (one nomination), meaning that ICLG led the way with 13 total nominations in those four categories.&nbsp; Related Grammy Nominations 2026: See the&nbsp;Complete List Billboard&#039;s Live Music Summit Honors Khalid with VENU&#039;s Disruptor Award Female Agents Have Come a Long Way, But There&#039;s Still Progress to Be Made: &#039;We Have to Continue to Fight for Each Other&#039; That marks the fifth time in the past eight years Interscope has led among labels.

To be sure, it was an extremely competitive race across several genres — but in a year when nascent country acts like Megan Moroney , Ella Langley and Zach Top were legitimate contenders with commercially and critically acclaimed breakthroughs, their names were nowhere to be found. &nbsp;No country artists made the cut. Looking further in the six general field categories, which, in addition to best new artist, include record, album, song, producer (non-classical) and songwriter ((non-classical) of the year only two country creators made the cut and both for songwriter of the year: Jessie Jo Dillon, who co-wrote songs for artists including Moroney, Jelly Roll ,&nbsp;Russell Dickerson and Morgan Wallen that were released during the eligibility period and Laura Veltz, who had songs cut by BigXthaPlug, Jessie Murph, Josh Ross and Maren Morris, among others.

Born from the pain and uncertainty of a loved one’s illness, as the artist recounted in a recent interview with&nbsp; Billboard , the album showcases a more mature and determined musician with renewed artistic freedom. Here, Alborán takes on the songwriting of all the songs and, for the first time, produces and arranges most of them, experimenting with rhythms like country/folk (“Vámonos de Aquí,” with Indiara Sfair), salsa music (“La Vida Que Nos Espera”) and merengue (“Si Te Quedas”). The album opens with “Clickbait,” a pop track that critiques the superficiality and fake news of social media, addressing the obsession with fame and &#8220;likes.&#8221; And continues with the emotional title track, “KM0,” in which he sings about facing a new start after going through a very difficult p…",

So why the two-plus-year gap between Alternative Airplay reigns? While not initially a promoted single, “So Far So Fake” was serviced to radio this summer after it went viral on shortform video platforms such as TikTok, spurred by a dance challenge set mostly to its instrumental break. Boosted by that buzz, “So Far So Fake” debuted on the multimetric Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart in August, eventually rising to No. 8 later that month. It also became the band’s first Billboard Hot 100 entry, reaching No. 64. In between “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake,” Pierce the Veil made Alternative Airplay once via its No. 27-peaking cover of Radiohead ’s “Karma Police” in June 2024. The band’s only other charter, “Circles,” hit No. 31 in 2016. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock &amp; Alternative Airplay chart, “So Far So Fa…",

It was a formula that yielded hits like “Despechá,” Rosalía’s take on merengue, and “La Fama,” her take on bachata alongside The Weeknd. The set provided an unlikely segue from her stunning but niche-appealing El Mal Querer , to a broad audience who embraced Rosalía and her sound with cult-like passion. It stands to reason, then, that something along those lines would follow in quick succession. Instead, fans waited for two and a half years for LUX , an album that not only breaks parameters for Rosalía, but for the musical landscape as a whole. Recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, it’s an ambitious, complex, sprawling orchestral and operatic ouvre of 18 tracks, performed in 13 different languages, where Rosalía pushes her vocal prowess into untested waters.
