Dean becomes the ninth female artist to land a No. 1 album in 2025, joining a list that includes Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde and Taylor Swift — a run that’s shaped much of the year’s chart narrative. Dean is also doubling up at the top. Her single “Man I Need” clocks a fifth straight week at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the fourth solo female artist to lead the singles tally in 2025, alongside Lola Young, Doechii and Swift. The year’s singles race has largely been driven by women, from Rosé’s extended reign with “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars to the surprise dominance of “Golden” by fictional K-pop group HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters .

Similar polygonal patterns in various strata were seen previously, elsewhere in Gale Crater. Curiosity captured the image using its Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), located on the turret at the end of the rover’s robotic arm, on Dec. 11, 2025 — Sol 4745, or Martian day 4,745 of the Mars Science Laboratory mission — at 16:55:37 UTC.

Freelancer Whose Moon Mascot design will join the Artemis II astronauts on their historic voyage around the Moon in early 2026? Between March 7 and Jun. 16, 2025, NASA worked with crowdsourcing company Freelancer to seek design ideas from global creators for a zero gravity indicator that will fly aboard the agency’s Artemis II test flight. Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space. Artemis II marks the first time that the public has had a hand in creating a crew’s mascot. The Mission Over…",
