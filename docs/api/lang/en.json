Project Misriah: Halo Ports was a collection of Counter-Strike 2 maps that recreated Halo 3's multiplayer in Valve's shooter sequel. Far more than just a map-pack, it aimed to replicate the specific feel of Halo 3's multiplayer as closely as possible, Halo-fying its arsenal, adjusting mechanics like ballistics and gravity to better align with Halo's Moon-hopping feel, and even throwing in authentic sound effects and announcer lines for good measure. Sadly, that's all over now. On X, Project Misriah cocreator Forddoyo posted an image of a DMCA takedown notice he had received from Microsoft via Valve. The takedown notice alleges that Misriah's \"unauthorized use of Halo game content in a workshop not associated with Halo games infringes their rights\", and as such Valve had \"temporarily removed your postings from Steam\". The crux of the issue here seems to be that Project Misriah uses assets from the Halo games, hence the use of the phrase \"Halo game content\".

Phoenix Point aimed to reimplement much of the granularity that Firaxis' slicker overhauls took out, adding features like soldier inventories, multiple human factions, manual aiming, and mutating enemies. Phoenix Point seemed to have the makings of a stone cold classic. Sadly, the result amounted to less than the sum of its parts, bogged down by bugs, repetition, and micromanagement. Then came Terror from the Void , a fan-made mega-mod that radically overhauls the experience, introducing a new story, reworking progression, and adding new mechanics like ability-changing delirium infections and zombified squadmates who would fight against you. Terror from the Void is beloved by Phoenix Point fans, with many believing it represents Phoenix Point at its best.

Sure, they're usually full of people (or monsters) that want to kill us, but that doesn't make it any less charming to get to play in the snow without getting cold. Now's the perfect time to look back on some of our favourites—so I thought I'd put some together in a very chill little quiz. All you have to do is look at the screenshots of various wintery locations, and tell us which game each one is from. Simple as that, and in the spirit of Christmas generosity, I've even made it start out nice and easy.

Crucially, the originally-named Bicycle Mod for GTA IV isn't a daft model swap. Those familiar with the GTA 4 modding scene will likely have tried the suite of broken bike 'em ups that've graced the gritty streets of Liberty City, but in this instance, creator Shvab has thrown themselves into GTA 4's ageing vehicle logic, disabling engine health, bypassing fuel-tank explosions, and preventing NPCs from trying to 'start the engine' on a literal bicycle. There's even a custom IK system so Niko's feet land properly on the pedals. As Shvab puts it: \"I wanted it to feel like GTA 4 always meant to have bikes—not like some clunky workaround.\" The mod is open source too, which means Liberty City's most chaotic engineers are already plotting upgrades. Planned features include a proper bunny hop and the ability to stand while riding—presumably so you can flee the cops at a blistering 12 mph while looking even more ridiculous. Shvab says the m…",

The demo of DriveCrazy, which I took for a quick whirl, starts off with you participating in an annual Kei Truck rally. Even in this comparatively normal mode, things are pretty wild. Literally anything you do while driving earns you points. Drive cleanly? Points. Knock down a lamppost? Points! Smash through a hedge, spin your truck 360, and bin it off the road into a rice paddy? Points, points, points. No sooner have you completed the rally when oh no, aliens invade! Suddenly you're trying to outrun missiles and laser strikes while buildings collapse around you.

In the last twelve months, Ironclad has introduced features like new scenarios , population mechanics, better tutorials and improved debris visuals for prettier battle aftermaths. Now, a new update takes aim at one of the RTS' weakest areas of play, that trickiest of 4X systems to implement—diplomacy. The Diplomatic Repercussions update aims to make negotiation a more interesting and viable path to victory. As Ironclad explains in a new video, at the heart of this overhaul is a significant AI rework. NPC factions have had their brains rewired to make them both smarter and friendlier than they were before. They're more likely to form alliances and forgive past transgressions, but also more tactically adept on the battlefield should diplomacy fail. These changes tie into a substantial economy overhaul aimed at encouraging diplomatic approaches. To summarise, planets no longer generate resources by default, with resource production instead based upon population. Hence, if a planet's population takes a big hit thr…",

The new Larian RPG, which is just called Divinity , is probably not going to require you to be up-to-date on the series lore. But the series has a lot to offer for the curious, even if the games do get pretty crusty the further back you go. Here's what Baldur's Gate 3 fans and anyone else interested in the next big Larian RPG should know about Divinity. What are the games in the Divinity series? What order should you play the Divinity games in? Rather than experiencing the Divinity games chronologically by release date, or according to the internal timeline of the series, we suggest investigating them in reverse order of release . That has you starting with the best of them and working backwards until they get too crusty for you. So our recommendation is: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Divinity: Original Sin Divinity: Dragon Commander (If you're into strategy games) Divinity 2: Ego Draconis Beyond Divinity (you can skip this one u…",

    "body": "When I flew to China to play Phantom Blade Zero earlier this year, I left without one key piece of information: When it would be out. The polished but walled off demo made it hard to tell how much of Phantom Blade Zero was finished, and it seemed equally possible that it would be arriving in early or late 2026. In a trailer at last night's Game Awards, developer S-Game finally dropped the date: September 9, on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The particularly welcome news here is the simultaneous release on PC and console. Sony has been a big promoter of Phantom Blade Zero, and helped reveal the game during a 2023 State of Play livestream. We've known from the beginning it would come to PC, but when remained an unanswered question. As with Stellar Blade or Death Stranding 2, it wasn't out of the question that Sony would negotiate a six month or so exclusive. I'm glad to see that's not happening. The game will be out on both Steam and the Epic Games Store on day one. The release date trailer shows off quite a bit of Phantom Blade Zero we haven't seen before, including at least a couple boss fights and characters related to the story, which S-Games has so far mostly avoided showing.

Hogwarts Legacy is the proverbial problematic fave: As PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde laid out in 2023, there was quite a bit of controversy when the game first launched over whether or not it was okay to play it , thanks to the notoriously anti-trans politics of author JK Rowling. Rowling wasn't involved with the development of Hogwarts Legacy but she does profit from it, and some portion of her money goes to support anti-trans organizations . But Harry Potter remains much beloved, and Hogwarts Legacy was and still is a hit: Nearly three years after it launched, there are currently more than 18,000 people playing the game on Steam alone . Unsurprisingly given that fact, the price remains pegged at the original $60. That makes Epic's giveaway—the first time Hogwarts Legacy has gone on the freebie block—a very attrac…",

Instead of a big, exclamation-point 'one more thing!' —the prophesied return of Gabe Newell, striding onto center stage with three fingers held high—host Geoff Keighley closed the show with a reveal of a brand new game from an unknown studio: A PvP raid shooter called Highguard. Which isn't to say Highguard wasn't hyped up to infinity before the trailer dropped. After a stage-spanning flight across stormy seas and rocky shores, Keighley did what he does and put the pedal to the metal with both feet. \"Sometimes our last reveal at the Game Awards is a teaser for something years and years away. But not tonight,\" Keighley pronounced with dramatic purpose. \"Our final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that built Apex Legends and Titanfall. Four years ago, the principals founded a new independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter genre forward with a new original game. They've done it in complete secrecy, which is even more amazing because the game is very deep into development. \"The power of independent, self-published studios to push this medium forward is a growing, and I think, positive theme in our industry. …",

Teeth tumble out of his mouth like popcorn, cheekbones snap, and his thumb goes at all sorts of weird angles while hair sloughs off his head. It was a pretty evocative trailer but, a couple years on, after multiple Baldur's Gate 3 playthroughs—was it really the vibe? I mean, sure, it was a game about mind flayers, and there are plenty of grisly scenes in it. In one part of the game, you delve into a nest stitched together out of pulsing human flesh. But on the whole, Baldur's Gate 3 is a bright heroic fantasy with bloody dark spots—it's a colourful, lively game that (unless you kill everybody) is about troubled people overcoming their worst nature and horrifying fates to save the realm. The body horror in that original trailer is a theme, but it's on…",

The AI outfit's CEO, Sam Altman, has marked the anniversary with a retrospective blog post which concludes much as the company's original mission statement began , with a call to \"benefit all humanity.\" Question is, how well has that ambition aged? Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments: \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.\" It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful. Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers.

The technology came out when I was still in school and today I'm at an age where buying a motor vehicle could be described as a midlife crisis. No, PhysX hasn't been relevant for a while. Or so I thought… Earlier this year, Nvidia pulled support for 32-bit CUDA applications with its newest generation graphics cards, the RTX 50 series. With it gone, it's no longer possible to natively run 32-bit games with hardware-accelerated PhysX effects. Why that matters: PhysX offers a way to run some in-game physics calculations on an add-in card . That not only frees up the CPU to focus on other things, it also allows developers to put a lot more physics-based effects into their games. As such, games with PhysX effects tend to have a lot of stuff going on. If you run a game with PhysX enabled but without the hardware to accelerate it then all of the physics calculations fall on your CPU. Even on today's much faster processors, with many more cores than those around during PhysX's peak, the impact of these added effects severely limits frame rate. The CPU becomes a bottleneck. Or you turn PhysX off. Now, I'll admit, I hadn't thought about Ph…",

During the beta, there was talk of a gear-based matchmaking system that had some players convinced it stuck around. But now the community has decided that Arc Raiders has a different kind of matchmaking. I've dubbed it 'aggression-based matchmaking', and it's the phenomenon that players have noticed for quite some time now, where those who don't engage in PvP get put in chill lobbies, whereas players who shoot on sight get placed in super aggressive lobbies. (Image credit: Embark) I first noticed this a few weeks ago. For the most part, I had been very chill in solo lobbies, just going in to loot or even team up with strangers to take down bigger arcs. It was a great experience, and the sense of camaraderie here was unmatched. But then, on one fateful day, I decided to shoot someone in a solo lobby. I ended up killing them, and my fate was sealed. From here on out, everything changed. I'd get shot in the back of the head before I even clocked another raider. Gone were my team-ups of old—I couldn't even talk to anyone, as the whole lobby was just shoot on sight. Now, my ex…",
