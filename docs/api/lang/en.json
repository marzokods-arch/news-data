The company says the issue affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under rare conditions. Manual and automatic Call Screen still work, and callers can continue using standard carrier voicemail instead. Most recent Pixel features have been welcome additions, but one meant to handle missed calls has instead caused a bit of a privacy snafu. Over the past few months, some users reported that callers could hear background audio during missed calls, rather than being cleanly prompted to leave a message. Google has now confirmed the issue and says it’s disabling Take a Message on the affected devices. In a post on its support forums , Siri Tejaswini, a Google community manager, said the company investigated the reports and confirmed they affect “a very small subset” of Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 devices under “very specific and rare circumstances.” Out of caution, Google is disabling Take a Message and its next-generation Call Screen features on those phones.",

AI-generated images just found a new canvas: your wall. SwitchBot’s latest isn’t a robot or a smart lock. It’s a collection of E Ink picture frames that double as always-on AI art displays. On the hardware side, the frames feature E Ink Spectra 6 technology, designed to mimic the layered look of real paint on real paper. As with other E Ink displays, the result is glare-free, backlight-free, and easy on the eyes, making it better suited as wall art than an LCD or OLED screen. Through the SwitchBot app, users can upload and organize artwork, store up to 10 images locally, sync new content, and schedule images to cycle on and off at given times of day. The frames are available in 7.3-inch, 13.3-inch, and 31.5-inch builds, each of which supports both horizontal and vertical orientations.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 series’s launch pricing may be the same as last year’s S25 series, at least in some markets. This is contrary to earlier reporting that suggested increased RAM prices would lead to higher S26 prices for consumers. The leak in question deals with pricing in Euros, and we can’t be totally sure what it means for US pricing. RAM prices have been soaring in recent months , a trend that’s caused product delays and fueled concern that new consumer electronics of all kinds will see reduced memory, higher sticker prices, or both. It was reported in November that the upcoming Galaxy S26 series was likely to see a RAM-induced price hike versus last year’s S25 phones, but a new leak suggests that might not be the case. Leaker Roland Quandt posted today on Bluesky that pricing for S26 base models will be “pretty much the same” as the S25 at launch, at least in European markets. His post goes on to say that the S26 Ultra may actually be less expensive, coming in about “100 Euro cheaper for 256 and 512GB” models, though he’s expecting the one-terabyte version’s pricing to remain the same.",

Vivo and OPPO debuted these new-generation add-on lenses, which can dramatically improve long-range camera zoom. The Galaxy S7 phones supported a 2x add-on lens back in 2016, but the Galaxy maker hasn’t adopted these new lenses just yet. The vivo X200 Ultra was the first Android phone to offer the new generation of telephoto extender lenses , and subsequent vivo and OPPO flagships support these add-on lenses too. These accessories attach to the phone’s telephoto camera to improve long-range zoom. Now, Apple could also be testing this tech for the iPhone 18 Pro series. Weibo leaker Smart Pikachu reported that Apple is evaluating teleconverter lenses, with an accompanying hashtag suggesting that this could land on the iPhone 18 Pro series. Check out the machine-translated post below.",

In my previous rentals, I had a bath with a shower curtain, which made it easy to prop up my phone on the nearby vanity to play podcasts while I got ready in the morning. Paying for a standalone speaker seemed like a luxurious upgrade then, not a necessity. But after moving to my new home a year ago, I missed this setup. My glass-enclosed shower blocks most of the sound coming from my phone; even with the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s louder speaker and the trick of using corners to amplify sound, I couldn’t hear it clearly in the shower. So I started looking for options from Soundcore, JBL, Tribit, Bose, and others, and eventually made an impulse buy in the unlikeliest of places: the IKEA home electronics section.",

The ITF has approved various models of the WHOOP tracker for match use so long as haptic feedback is disabled, but Grand Slam events can impose additional rules independently. WHOOP responded by sending its Body apparel collection, which conceals the tracker within undergarments, to players, though using them still risks violating competition regulations. WHOOP makes one of the most interesting fitness trackers around, focusing entirely on strain, recovery, and long-term performance rather than on-wrist features, to the point that it does not even have a display. It’s a niche device that works out well for athletes who want deeper insights into their bodies. Of late, WHOOP has landed in some unforeseen controversy during a tennis tournament, and the company has wittingly responded by sending players… underwear?

Unlike the more premium Phone 3, which largely disappointed with its inflated pricing, Nothing’s Phone 3a and the 3a Pro impressed with their high value proposition and features absent from mid-range phones. Naturally, the successors, Nothing Phone 4a and Phone 4a Pro, have big shoes to fill. We expect the series to come with reasonable upgrades without a significant price increase, and a recent leak proves this assumption may be partially true. The Nothing Phone 4a Pro has been on the horizon for several months now.

Now, it looks like Google has accidentally given the world an early look at this unified platform. 9to5Google spotted a Google bug report on the Chromium Issue Tracker that contains two screen recordings of Aluminium OS running on an HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5 Chromebook. Google has since restricted access to the report, but the outlet still retained the recordings. Check out the one screen recording at the top of the page, and the other below.",

Google must also provide rival search engines and AI chatbots with access to anonymized ranking, query, and click data to foster fair competition. The Commission will issue preliminary findings within three months, along with a draft of the measures it intends to impose on Google to comply with the DMA. Update: January 27, 2026 (11:03 PM ET): Google’s Senior Competition Counsel, Clare Kelly, shared the following statement on the matter with Android Authority : Android is open by design, and we’re already licensing Search data to competitors under the DMA. However, we are concerned that further rules which are often driven by competitor grievances rather than the interest of consumers, will compromise user privacy, security, and innovation .",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A Redditor is building a new version of Snake for Galaxy Watch, and it already looks better than most Wear OS alternatives. Bezel controls and a circular playfield make it feel natural on a smartwatch. The game isn’t finished or publicly available yet, but it’s a promising proof of concept. Like many of you, I’m old enough to remember when the Nokia 3210 was the phone to have, and Snake was the game everyone played. It was ultra simple and brutally addictive. As far as we’ve come with mobile gaming, it’s hard to match the nostalgia of those halcyon days, especially on a smartwatch . That’s why a recent post on Reddit’s Galaxy Watch community caught our attention. A developer going by JackGrylls shared an early build of a Snake-style game made specifically for Galaxy Watch and Wear OS, aiming to bring back the feel of the old bezel-controlled version they remember from the Tizen days.",

Spotify music videos feel so normal now that it’s easy to forget they’re still officially a beta feature. That’s a good thing, because it means some of the rough edges are still being ironed out. One of the biggest issues with them is what happens when you leave the Now Playing screen while a video is playing, and it looks like Spotify might be following YouTube’s example in working on a fix.

While emulation continues to make baby steps toward better compatibility, game decompilations and recompilations offer a different pathway toward game preservation. Instead of running the original game files, they transform them into code that runs on PCs and other modern hardware. Now, for the first time, it’s looking like a new console is joining the party: the Sony PlayStation 2. A new tool called PS2Recomp has gained significant attention, mostly thanks to a viral Tweet from yesterday.

Despite Nintendo’s Play Store DMCA , the Switch emulator Eden remains in very active development, with the team dropping its first major update of the year today. It’s the first minor version bump in the history of the project, bumping it to version 0.1.0. The update fixes several regressions from version 0.0.4, as well as long-standing bugs from its Yuzu ancestor. As a result, popular games like Metroid Prime 4 and Luigi’s Mansion 3 are now more playable than ever, with fewer crashes and graphical glitches.",

After first announcing Wemo’s shutdown back in July last year, Belkin is sending emails to users again, reminding them to arrange alternatives if needed.

Samsung’s mid-range phones usually play it safe, but the upcoming Galaxy A57 is looking to stir things up by trimming the fat. As everyone focuses on the Galaxy S26 , a recent listing from China’s TENAA certification agency has given us an early look at the upcoming model. If you’ve held a Galaxy A56 , the new model should feel familiar but more premium. The TENAA images show the same vertical camera stack as before. The frame looks like it’s made of metal, which should make it more durable, and it uses the Key Island design, where the power and volume buttons are on a slightly raised part of the frame.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos now lets you type prompts to control how your photos are turned into videos. The text prompts can be refined after your first pass, and Google will also offer suggestions. We previously spotted the custom prompt option in testing. When Google first rolled out its AI photo-to-video tools in Google Photos, the idea was nice, but the execution could feel a little hit-or-miss. You could ask for subtle movement, or tap “I’m feeling lucky” and see what happens. Sometimes it worked as you expected. Other times, not so much. That’s now changing. In a support page post , Google just introduced a text prompts element to the Photo to video feature. The new option gives you a say in how your pictures are animated instead of leaving everything up to the AI’s mood. Videos generated with the tool can also include audio by default, which should make the results feel a bit more finished when you share them.",
