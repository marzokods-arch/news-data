These include new features like a taskbar, desktop windowing, enhanced drag-and-drop support, improved app adaptability, and more. Despite these improvements, most people would agree that Android tablets still have a long way to go before they can replace PCs, largely because of their limited multitasking capabilities. Thankfully, we know that Google is working to improve Android’s multitasking capabilities. The company is making big changes to the platform in preparation for Android-powered PCs , and these changes will benefit not only future Android PCs but also existing Android tablets. One such change Google has been exploring is the ability to launch any Android app in a floating bubble, taking a niche feature currently reserved for messaging apps and turning it into a powerful, general-purpose multitasking feature.",

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

Now, the company has followed up by bringing the new Android upgrade to last year’s flagship phone. Sony Xperia 1 VI owners on the Xperia subreddit have reported the availability of the Android 16 update. This release appears to be limited to the likes of Bulgaria and Poland right now. So owners in other markets might have to wait a few days for a wider rollout.",

Users will be able to assign higher priority to notifications from certain apps. The feature will also use AI to arrange notifications based on priority. Samsung is prepping for a significant step-up for its smartphones’ interface with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Ahead of the purported beta rollout starting late next month, we’ve already encountered nearly a dozen noticeable changes that could come to eligible Samsung phones and tablets with the update, including iOS-like summarization for notifications using AI . And now, we’re learning about another potential notification upgrade. With One UI 8.5, Samsung may let you assign a higher priority to specific notifications, based on the feature added to a recently leaked One UI 8.5 build. As spotted by Sammyguru , the “Prioritize notification” option could be toggled on to set certain notifications as important.",

    "body": "Credit: Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority Yesterday, ChatGPT announced its new AI-powered browser, Atlas, and I’ve already installed it on my computer to give it a whirl. There shouldn’t be anything surprising about this, right? Well, it isn’t. What is surprising is the fact that Google announced its Gemini integration in Chrome more than a month ago, and I still don’t have access to it. The reason is simple: I live in France, not the US. And Google has decided that Chrome’s Gemini integration is a privilege only Americans get to try, thus locking out the rest of the world. Meanwhile, OpenAI has an “everybody welcome” approach, with no georestrictions on its Atlas browser.",

The automaker will integrate Google’s Gemini AI into its vehicles starting in 2026, offering a smarter, conversational assistant. Gemini will be available as an over-the-air update via the Play Store for OnStar-equipped vehicles (2015 and newer). GM will also test other AI models from firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, while keeping user data private. General Motors is taking another major step away from smartphone projection systems. Having previously dropped support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay across its EVs, the automaker has now confirmed that it will also ditch support for these technologies in its future gas-powered models. Instead, the company is developing a centralized computing platform that will serve as the backbone of its next-generation in-car software. At the heart of this system will be Google’s Gemini.",

On Tuesday, Samsung announced the Galaxy XR as its long-awaited XR headset to rival the Apple Vision Pro. As a VR/XR headset in the current market, the Galaxy XR does look promising. It’s got impressive hardware, capable specs, and powerful software with Android XR. But at the end of the day, the Galaxy XR is still very expensive. The headset itself costs $1,800, and if you buy the controllers and carrying case, you’re looking at an additional $500 .",

The Samsung Galaxy S25 series launched in January, much like the Galaxy S24 series last year. It stands to reason that the Galaxy S26 phones will launch in January 2026. However, a reliable tipster has now claimed that a delay is on the cards. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The feature, currently referred to as “Me Meme,” allows users to insert their face into meme templates. It requires a backed-up reference photo, preferably a clear selfie, to work. Google Photos is inarguably one of the best apps that you could have on your Android flagship. What makes Google Photos better is that Google has been constantly and tirelessly working on adding new features to the app, making it useful in the present times. We’ve spotted Nano Banana integration in the works, as well as improvements to the photo-to-video generator . We’ve now spotted Google Photos working on a meme generator, but with a twist: it will use AI to make you the meme.

The new phone will have a 1.5K resolution screen running at 165Hz, compared to the OnePlus 13’s QHD+ 120Hz display. The company says this is because it’s not possible to have a QHD+ screen running at 165Hz. The OnePlus 15 is scheduled to launch in China on Monday, and we know the phone has a 165Hz refresh rate. We previously heard rumors that the device would have a lower-resolution screen, though, and OnePlus has now confirmed this. OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

According to a report from Kuketz Blog , the new Pixel Camera app now has a hard dependency on Google Play Services. That means if you’re using GrapheneOS or another de-Googled system, the app will probably crash or fail to launch entirely.",
