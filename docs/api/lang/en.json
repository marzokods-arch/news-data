    "body": "Days after a report from Bloomberg explained that Microsoft has expected unrealistic profit margins from its gaming division —one likely reason for its raft of studio closures, game cancelations and thousands of layoffs—a chipper Satya Nadella basically said as much out loud during an interview at a Github conference on Tuesday. \"If we as an industry don't continue to innovate how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model—the best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund,\" the Microsoft CEO said on the tech-focused talk show TBPN . It was at least the fifth time in the interview that Nadella said the word \"innovation,\" though at no point did an idea of any specificity precede or follow it. While most of the interview bounced between incomprehensible AI talk and variations on 'Microsoft's Azure servers make a shitload of money,' when it came to gaming Nadella didn't seem to have much new to say, though what he did say he said with inspiring confidence: \"Most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent, maybe, some new interactive media as well.

One day is not enough time to confidently declare Blackwell Fields the worst map in Battlefield 6, but that hasn't stopped folks from doing it anyway . I'm enjoying its glorious exploding oil derricks and the way its rolling hills and minimal building cover emphasizes vehicle play, but its major flaw is abundantly clear, because it's the same flaw that's been grinding everybody's gears since Battlefield 6's beta: several of the maps that Battlefield 6 considers \"large\" are actually pretty small. Blackwell Fields isn't big enough. New Sobek City isn't big enough. Siege of Cairo isn't big enough. Iberian Offensive isn't big enough. Empire State isn't big enough. We're beyond coincidence. There's a serious disconnect between what DICE and the rest of Battlefield Studios believe Battlefield maps should look like and what a lot of players obviously want, and I think I've identified an important reason why. Here are the layouts of Blackwell Fields and New Sobek City , two \"large\" Conquest maps that feel cramped. Image 1 of …",

Today, update 1.14 has finally landed—and it brought a bonus Balatro-themed expansion with it. Considering that Vampire Survivors was one of the first games featured in Balatro's first Friends of Jimbo update —a collaboration that both games have followed with more crossovers than I'm willing to count—it's only fitting that Jimbo would return the favor for the update that makes Vampire Survivors more of a communal experience than ever before. Alongside the online co-op mode in which up to four players can roam freely around the map while leveling up together, the Ante Chamber expansion adds Balatro's Jimbo and a trio of rare jokers as playable characters, four similarly Balatro-themed weapons including a burning score counter and a banana barrage, and the titular Ante Chamber stage. To start unlocking Ante Chamber content, you'll need to purchase the Joker Disk relic in the Moongolow stage for 50,000 gold. If you play a lot of Vampire Survivors, you might already have tha…",

The second punch, delivered near the end of the year, was ZSNES, which did the same for much newer Super Nintendo games. And it was fast —even on the modest PCs of the era. \"When I was 16 years old I started learning assembly, and I got so fascinated with optimization, making everything as fast as possible,\" said zsKnight, the developer behind ZSNES, in an interview last week . While most software is written in higher level programming languages like C++ that are easier to work with, even at a young age zsKnight was skilled enough in low level assembly language to start using it to program his own emulator.

So I was genuinely excited to learn today that a sequel, Darkwood 2, is now in development. This does not represent a comeback for original Darkwood developer Acid Wizard Studio, however: It remains in a state of long-term hiatus, which it embarked on in 2023 immediately after releasing an alpha for Soccer Kids, \"a game about soccer made by people who suck at playing soccer.\" Darkwood 2 is instead being made by Ice-Pick Lodge, the team best known for the Pathologic games.

To work all this out, the researchers took a closer look at what the human eye is actually capable of. They found humans can discern more pixels than previously thought, but there are still limits. \"Our results demonstrate that the resolution limit is higher than what was previously believed, reaching 94 pixels per degree (ppd) for foveal achromatic vision, 89 ppd for red-green patterns, and 53 ppd for yellow-violet patterns,\" the paper published in Nature says .

A floating skateboard, and plenty of other mobility (Image credit: Epic Games) This season started with limited mobility—now, between shockwaves, the witch's broom, Crash Pads and the Last Call knife we've got loads, and that variety feels fantastic. I hope Epic keeps it up. Alongside shockwave grenades—the best mobility in the game —I hope Bart's skateboard plays a big role. It's in the leaked key art, which is a good start, but it'll need to be more than just a simple roll-along-the-ground transport.

But it seems the technology isn't mature enough to achieve this truly affordably. Or even for a moderate price. Yes, the HyperFlux V2 looks and feels great, and it does its job, but it's very expensive at $120. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's talk about what that job is.

    "body": "As games become larger, more elaborate and significantly more expensive to make, the concept of player agency and optional paths becomes a riskier prospect for RPG developers. For Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 , however, it's an essential feature, according to senior narrative designer Joe Fielder. \"That's been one of the directives from our three directors from the start, to have a game that really is reactive to how the player wants to play,\" Fielder tells us. \"When I work on the narrative for The Outer Worlds 2, it's not my story. I'm writing to give you, the player, options of how to roleplay as the character you rolled up at the beginning.\" It's one place I can categorically say that the sequel is significantly better than its predecessor. The Outer Worlds 2 gives you a lot of incredibly distinct ways to build your character, starting with your background and initial perks, and then through all the optional flaws you'll encounter as you play, along with the perks you can pick when you level up. \"Sometimes that means you have a funny line,\" says Fielder, \"sometimes that means you get access to an area you wouldn't, or ally with somebody that you wouldn't, or you get a mission …",

Researchers at the Ohio State University recently found that mushrooms you can eat can also be trained to act as bioelectronic data processors (via phys.org ).

To put that $96.5 million figure into context, with the highest tier of Xbox Game Pass now costing $30 a month, this could pay for 3.216 million months of the game streaming service, or 268,055 years. 268,055 years ago, Homo neanderthalensis roamed the earth, and 268,055 years from now, Nvidia is likely going to be the first company to be worth $1 quintillion, probably.

The result is roughly half the performance quoted by Nvidia.
