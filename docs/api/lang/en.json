Character Select Welcome to Character Select , a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. For example, my Peak scout has had the same scowling expression and kissy mouth since I started playing. No matter how many cosmetics I've unlocked, this has never changed and probably never will. I don't doubt a number of other players feel the same about their Scout design, resulting in specific cosmetics being reserved for them. I'll be honest though, I didn't expect to see cosplays for the Scouts. As much as I love them in-game, I never had that feeling of wanting to d…",

As you might be sick of hearing me parrot by now: videogames are nothing without their music. It's not a side dish to be enjoyed alongside the main meal, but rather an integral ingredient without which the entire recipe would fall apart. Videogame music has long had a huge influence on me—I'm regularly bumping tracks from my favourite games in my day-to-day life, and the emotions they've stirred up over the years remain with me even when I'm listening away from the big in-game moment they were originally orchestrated for. (Image credit: Bethesda, Mick Gordon) One of the earliest memories I have of going \"holy shit, videogame music is really good\" (okay I probably didn't say exactly that considering I was like, four-years-old or something) was the all-out theme song for Killer Instinct Gold on the Nintendo 64.

Now, another challenger has, er, entered the half-pipe (I apologise to all skaters). Skate Style is a new game about risking shredded knees for the thrill of mild propulsion that leans closer to the Session end of the authenticity scale. Developer Zellah Games bills it as a \"next-gen skateboarding game\" focussed on realism and physics-powered tricks. What separates Skate Style from other games of its ilk is its extensive customisation. Not only can you customise the look of your skater and board, but Skate Style also comes bundled with an in-game animation editor. This allows players to adjust numerous variables like body movement, foot placement, and timing. This combines with a physics-based trick system where your character's feet can actually catch the board. As for where you'll be skating, Zellah Games highlights two maps …",

It's gone down a storm with Terraria' community, but there is one aspect to the update that players will have to wait a little longer for—mod compatibility. This is because Terraria's mod support relies heavily on tModLoader , an open-source addon that facilitates both creating and playing mods. It's an enormously popular tool, with a user-base that rivals some of the biggest games. But as with many mod projects, the 1.4.5 update has produced compatibility issues that will take some time to fix. This was explained by tModLoader's creators in a Steam post . \"We know everyone is looking forward to tModLoader and mods having access to all of the new content and features as well,\" the modders wrote earlier this week. \"We'd like to remind users that updating tModLoader to major Terraria releases is a huge undertaking.\" For context, the modders pointed out that it took nine months to update tModLo…",

    "body": "We've known that Timberborn has been approaching the end of its early access journey for some time, but developer Mechanistry had yet to pin down a specific 1.0 launch date for its popular beaver-themed city builder. Now though, as the developer gnaws through the last few items on its to-do list, it has formally revealed when the game will depart early access, and it's happening in March. Announcing the date in a Steam post , Mechanistry also showed off the game's intro cinematic, which it has temporarily redubbed as a \"lore trailer\". I query this title, not only because lore isn't generally foregrounded in this manner, but also because the arc of the trailer is \"some beavers cross a desert and then start building a city,\" which is not exactly deep worldbuilding. It is a nicely animated video, though, with some supremely gravelly narration from British actor Shaun Dooley. As Mechanistry notes in the post, Timberborn has come a long way since its debut into early access in 2021. Previous updates have introduced water pumps , robotic beavers and hazardous polluted water , alongside whole new transportation methods such as ziplines and water tubes. The current version has 16 playable…",

At one point in development her life would have been at stake if you crossed the expansion's villain Gaunter O'Dimm. The restored scenes use dialogue found in the game files, which suggests this plotline was cut quite late in development, but everything else has been made from scratch.

The next mission has you meet up with Elise, your templar girlfriend, on the streets of revolutionary Paris. She's being pursued by a mob of templar thugs—her faction aren't fans of her or you at this point in the story—and you get roped into the chase. Literally. Her escape route leads to a demonstration of a hot-air balloon, the same model the Montgolfier brothers used just nine years previous in the first manned balloon flight. Of course, she jumps in. It's your job to cut the ropes while fighting off the first wave of pursuers. It's a perfect setup for the kind of over-the-top pseudo-historical hijinks the Assassin's Creed games specialize in. This is Ezio piloting Leonardo da Vinci's prototype tank, or Lydia Frye shooting down biplanes over London with an experimental anti-aircraft gun. The Montgolfier springs into the air with Elise in it, but not you. You have to parkour after it while Elise leans out to shoot snipers. When the Montgolfier gets tangled on a rooftop you cut it loose, with just enough time for a dramatic leap into …",

It was violent and it was 3D and it looked exactly like real life.\" Today, Marshall is the director of Size Five Games, a British indie studio that has developed games like the point 'n' click throwback Time Gentlemen, Please! the procedurally generated heist sim The Swindle , and the hybrid platformer and adventure game Lair of the Clockwork God .

There's a Baldur's Gate TV show coming, headed up by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl and The Last of Us fame. That's either great news or terrible news depending on which precise Larian developer you are , but either way it's a significant enough occasion to warrant marking, if you ask me. I decided to mark it with a quiz. But which quiz? We've had BG3 quizzes before, and the game is so dog-eared from repeat playthroughs by fans that it's difficult to come up with something truly challenging. Then it hit me: gnomes. Gnomes are great; they're literally just weird little guys, and BG3's gnome characters are some of its finest. So here it is: the definitive, be-all and end-all quiz about the gnomes of Baldur's Gate 3. Warning: it's actually quite hard.",

Well, it achieved the seemingly impossible, improving upon X-COM: Enemy Unknown . Firaxis' refinement of Julian Gollop's groundbreaking original seemed like a perfect distillation, retaining the essence of what made Gollop's game great—the tension, the heartbreak, that feeling of squaring off against overwhelming odds—while also ironing out many of the kinks present in that original design. But then along came XCOM 2. Firaxis' sequel upped the ante from defending Earth from alien invasion to liberating it from alien occupation, recasting your organisation as a scrappy guerilla unit fighting a totalitarian regime from within. It introduced stealth to missions, letting you get the drop on xeno soldiers, and transformed your base into a flying fortress that could travel across the geoscape. It al…",

When you move out, though, all bets are off, and you can tell everyone who lives nearby exactly how you feel. And I've never seen a moving out message sent quite so spectacularly as by Rust player and reddit user UniverseBear, who constructed a giant, illuminated middle finger to say sayonara to his server buddies. As seen in UniverseBear's reddit post , the flashing flip-off is emblazoned on the side of a rectangular tower built from corrugated iron and concrete. The offending gesture itself is constructed from industrial lights timed to cycle through an animation where the middle finger slowly raises from a clenched fist. It seems this is something of a tradition for UniverseBear, a way to cap off a round of Rust when the server is due to be wiped. \"Making one of these is often how I like to end a successful wipe,\" he wrote, before detailing how exactl…",

Sci-fi Shooters 2.0 is a two-tiered bundle, and there's good reasons to shoot for either of them. Paying the minimum price of $14 (£12.51) will net you four games, namely Doom Eternal . Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition , Black Mesa , and FPS roguelite Battle Shapers . I'm not hugely familiar with Battle Shapers, but the other three games are, in my opinion, must-play experiences. Doom Eternal is still the best single-player FPS you can play today, a spellbinding iteration of id Software's 2016 Doom reboot that rewards mastery of its rich combat system in a manner unlike anything I've played before or since. Even last year's Doom: The Dark Ages , which I enjoyed very much, cannot compete with the ferocious pace and intensity of Eternal's combat.

In The Outer Worlds 2, which I finally got around to playing this week after hearing great things , I don't feel like a real person while moving around. I feel like a camera, perfectly hovering in place and magically stabilized as I plop one foot in front of the other. It's as if Adam Jensen installed gimbals in his eyeballs. I'm talking about headbob : the subtle camera movement of first-person games that mimics the body's natural bob as it walks or runs. Headbob is so established and omnipresent in first-person games that it's rare we have an occasion to acknowledge it. When headbob comes up, it's usually because a game has too much of it. The Outer Worlds 2 has no headbob. Zero , unless you're sprinting. Your neck is totally detached from the motion of your body, and it's driving me up the wall. It's distracting, ugly, and comes off as a totally unforced error. I didn't realize just how necessary head jostling is to beli…",

Anthropic's adverts criticise ads being introduced to ChatGPT, and describe it as a \"betrayal\" of users. I regret to inform you all that the irony metre has officially smashed. It has gone off the scale. First thing to say is, the ads are also good: I'd recommend watching one or two first, while thinking about OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's face the first time he saw them. To take one example, embedded above, an AI user asks a bot (a middle-aged woman, in the ad) how to communicate better with his mother. When he asks what to do if the advice doesn't work out, the \"AI\" recommends a site for dating mature women where \"cubs\" can find \"cougars.\" Each ad ends with the same sting: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\" As if it couldn't get better, this is backed by the refrain from Dr Dre's What's the Difference, which goes \"What's the difference between me and you?\" Look, I know it's marketing, I know they've \"won\" by ge…",

If it's not one thing, it's another: the anniversary of Half-Life 2, the latest mention of \"HLX\" (speculated to be an internal codename) in the Steam backend or, my personal favourite, a spike in pizza deliveries near Valve's offices. People will glom onto anything and everything that seems to be even tangentially related to Half-Life 3, and the latest rumour doing the rounds was no exception. The Valve fan account GabeFollower posted a new YouTube video claiming that this time it was actually, definitely happening, including a claim that the project is so done-and-dusted that Valve had begun moving its devs onto other projects. So far, so Sunday morning, though for whatever reason this claim was picked up and reported on by several outlets. Now: any games developer reading the above is probably laughing themselves silly. This is an over-simplification but games have so many moving parts that the final stages of development are where the whole project starts coming together.

Enter sodium-ion batteries. As reported by Live Science , a new experiment performed by researchers at the Tokyo University of Science has yielded promising results. Lithium-ion batteries work by using a graphite cathode to store the charged lithium ions—this is what actually causes your battery to be charged. Sodium ions need hard carbon instead, and previously, it was found that the sodium ions got jammed when trying to flow into the porous material.

Almost boringly easy. I got into all this expecting to have to wrestle the OS' peccadilloes into submission, but aside from minor tinkering to get proprietary Nvidia drivers and codecs installed, it's been smooth sailing. Imagine my disappointment. And now, as of the most recent Steam beta update, there's even less Linux weirdness to deal with when you slip free of the shackles of Windows. As of yesterday's Steam (and Steam Deck) client beta update , Valve has put paid to a bug that meant the platform would sometimes forget it can run Windows games on Linux. Cut it some slack; it's 23 years old. The bug in question afflicted users with especially large libraries—though Valve doesn't say how large—and would \"result in Proton games showing up as 'Not valid on current platform'\". Which rather defeats the whole point of Proton—Valve's fancy, WINE-based compatibility layer that lets Windows-only games run on your Linux distro of choice. Which is rather good news.

The big tentpole additions are a new raid quickplay option and a major wardrobe update, the latter introducing a fashion template system that, on paper, lets players quickly and easily change their looks. This is the first major update of the Visions of Eternity expansion cycle, one that—in a tweak to how previous annual expansions worked—features very little in the way of new stuff . Due to complaints around how limited the updates were in previous expansions, ArenaNet is saving new maps and story chapters to the second and third major updates. This one, then, is all about the quality-of-life additions. So how much quality of life have these two new features actually brought?

This week: Stopped being blissfully unaware that a TV sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 was in development. Baldur's Gate 3 is too big for Hasbro to leave alone. We already knew that, despite Larian moving onto greener pastures, Wizards of the Coast and its owner wanted to do a sequel, and we'll almost certainly see a sequel. But first we're getting a TV show , and I can't help but think that's a big mistake. Canon is a weird concept for D&D because it's an entirely player-driven experience. In the Forgotten Realms there are some big, immutable events, like the Time of Troubles, when the gods temporarily became mortal, or the chaos caused by the Absolute, but within those events are countless stories authored by players, a million headcanons and narratives forged around the table.

'Obsession' isn't a strong enough word to describe my last three weeks with this bizarre roguelike strategy game/cat breeding simulator.
