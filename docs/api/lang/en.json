When I drive, I mostly rely on Maps’ audio navigation.

That’s when I realized it had a few things I actually hadn’t backed up. After all, the data on a temporary or secondary device is generally less important than the data on one that you used as a daily driver. In my case, I was also selling the device, so I didn’t have the option to simply leave it as-is in case I needed to recover something later.",

However, so far, I haven’t been able to replace Google Photos completely, but I might have finally found a way to truly cut the cord. See, I’m loath to fork out for Google One when I have 10TB of hard drive space on my NAS. Still, I use Google Photos to make the occasional quick edit, to help share snaps with friends and family quickly, and even duplicate a few of my most cherished memories as part of the recommended 3-2-1 backup rule . For storing most of my older snaps, I’ve been using PhotoPrism, but as good as it is as a photo library, it lacks the rich feature set of Photos, especially for managing multiple users in my home.",

However, as I wandered the show floor on my last day in Las Vegas, I stumbled upon another tiny little Android device, and I think it might have stolen some of the Communicator’s thunder.

Nothing says a future update will let Phone 3a Lite users uninstall Lock Glimpse. Nothing phones started getting Android 16 with the rollout of Nothing OS 4.0 in November . On Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro , and 3a Lite, the update included a feature called Lock Glimpse, a widely panned addition that served ads on those phones’ lock screens. Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it. That solution wasn’t satisfactory, though, as users found the software was draining their batteries even when turned off . Today, Nothing shared that the feature is being removed from the 3a series (except the 3a Lite) as of the Nothing OS 4.0 December update.",

The Find N6 is expected to be a powerhouse with a 200MP primary camera, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and a 6,000mAh battery. The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete. Samsung won’t be the only Android brand launching two book-style foldables this year, as it appears even OPPO will join the party with its own wide foldable.

If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

That idea has been around for years on paper, but the reality is that it has taken much longer for robot mowers to live up to that hands-off ideal. The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently. Where things have historically fallen apart is navigation. A mower that can’t reliably understand where it is or where to go will always need more babysitting than most people expect from an “autonomous” machine.",

Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority CES has a habit of shining a spotlight on subtly game-changing tech categories. Every year, alongside the headline-grabbing TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, there are products that don’t always get the same attention but still shape everyday life. Pool care is one of them. For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

We first covered the accessory back in October when it was announced alongside the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection, and while we’d hoped to see it hit shelves by the end of 2025, an early January arrival is close enough. Portable charging cases aren’t a novel idea (brands like RingConn and Samsung already offer their own), but this launch closes a noticeable gap in Oura’s accessory lineup.",

The redesigned Fitbit experience began rolling out to users in late October, but it was available only for Fitbit Premium subscribers and through the Public Preview program.

By contrast, Android phones first adopted 200MP sensors in 2022, and a growing number of OEMs use them for their main or tele cameras. If confirmed, this means Android manufacturers will enjoy a major hardware advantage for several more years. Android phones have long offered 200MP cameras, with Motorola, Xiaomi, and Samsung initially leading the charge. We’ve since seen 200MP sensors used on Android phones by OPPO, realme, HONOR, and vivo. What about Apple, though? Well, it sounds like we’re in for a long wait. According to an investor note by Morgan Stanley (spotted via AppleInsider ), Apple will only adopt 200MP cameras on the iPhone 21 series in 2028. Of course, Apple is tipped to skip the iPhone 19 name in 2027 in favor of iPhone 20.",

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.
