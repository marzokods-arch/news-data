I really, truly believe that the Pixel is in its best position in several years, with a steadily improving chipset and cameras that continue to get smarter. The real reason I’m willing to make this declaration so early, though, is that I think everyone else is a mess. Here’s why I think Google can simply coast to greatness while everyone else spins their wheels.",

Whether I’m craving pizza, need to calculate compound interest, find a tailor for a shirt alteration, or check the current Premier League scores, I can accomplish all of these tasks with an app of some description. So naturally, when it comes to customizing my phone’s wallpaper, I’ll use a dedicated wallpaper app . According to a recent reader poll , though, not every Android Authority reader agrees. Most of you get wallpapers directly from the internet, swatting apps like Panels to the wayside. However, there’s a problem with relying on apps and the internet for customization: these wallpapers aren’t entirely yours. With this in mind, I’ve made a point to go a step further with my phone customization and create my own wallpapers to bring a real personal touch to my device. For those who want to do the same, here are some ways I go about this.",

With the Pixel 10 series shipping out of the box with built-in Qi2 and Qi2 25W , we thought things would finally be standardized and that we wouldn’t have to think about which charger we’re using with which phone. Alas, that is far from the truth. I’ve conducted many tests over the past few months and discovered that there are intricate differences between older Pixels and newer ones, and how each of them adapts to different wireless chargers. The takeaway? It’s easy to buy the wrong charger for your phone and, as our surveys have revealed, many of you have fallen for that trap. Here’s what I found out and why that’s wrong.",

That balance is slowly changing in the US as prepaid adoption is rising while postpaid growth has stalled or even slipped in some cases. The main driver is customer frustration with steady price escalations, including fee hikes, smaller autopay discounts, and direct plan increases. For example, Verizon recently cut its myPlan autopay discount from ten dollars to five dollars, and all three major carriers have raised their infrastructure fees. T-Mobile also stopped including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing. I have argued before that prepaid is now the better choice for many consumers. The real questions are what caused this shift, whether it could have been avoided, and how worried the big three should be about prepaid competitors.",

Just weeks after we covered ViWoods’ unexpectedly ambitious AiPaper Reader, the world’s first reader running Android 16 , the company is already expanding the lineup. This time, it’s adding a splash of color with the AiPaper Reader C, a variant that trades the crisp monochrome Carta panel for a color E Ink display. It’s a trendy pivot, as more and more e-readers get colorful makeovers throughout the market. The move to color should make the Reader C more appealing to anyone who regularly handles comics, illustrated books, children’s titles, or PDFs with charts and diagrams. Color E Ink still isn’t vibrant in the LCD sense, but it does add context that grayscale can’t always capture. As always, a color E Ink panel also reduces sharpness, meaning text and fine lines won’t look as crisp as they do on the monochrome AiPaper Reader.",

Payouts will mostly be automatic, but users who can’t receive automatic payments have other options. A couple of years ago, Google settled a lawsuit brought by US states that accused the company of holding an illegal monopoly on Android app distribution, using its position to overcharge users for apps and in-app purchases. Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

As reported by 9to5Google , all TicWatch listings on Amazon have essentially disappeared .

So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out.

The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update.

With improved app icon customization, lock screen widgets , and more, QPR2 is a darn good update. One of the more interesting changes is actually a reversal of something added in Android 16 QPR1 this past September. As part of the Material 3 Expressive interface added to Pixel phones with that update, one of the bigger UI tweaks was a blur effect in the app drawer and Quick Settings panel. I don’t mind it, but it’s something a lot of Pixel users have wanted Google to get rid of.",

Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

A post by user subferno on the Pixel subreddit says that, since installing the December update, their Pixel 10 Pro’s always-on display has exhibited a “hard flicker,” apparently toggling on and off for a split second whenever it refreshes.

For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas.

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",
