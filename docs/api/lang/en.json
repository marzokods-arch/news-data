The opera said it will seek to end its affiliation with the Kennedy Center through an “amicable transition” and will return to operating independently. It cited financial constraints imposed after Trump fired the Kennedy Center’s board and installed allies to oversee it.

Even though the Rams have a better record, the Panthers received home field advantage this round because they won the NFC South division this season. Kicking off at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, the Rams are hitting the road but are still the clear favorites to win with their impressive 12-5 record. However, the Panthers have home field advantage and really have nothing to lose.

The British rocker touched down in Sydney earlier this week and quickly drew massive fan attention after attending a pop-up photo gallery exhibition in Newtown, where crowds reportedly became so large that police were called to manage the situation. The event, titled Yungblud: IDOLS , featured photography by British photographer Tom Pallant and showcased images from previous legs of the singer’s ongoing tour. Yungblud — born Dominic Harrison — had encouraged fans to attend the gallery via social media, telling them he would be there in person. Hundreds reportedly queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the artist, with some lining up from early morning. Though no major incidents were reported, the turnout was large enough that authorities asked the event to wrap earlier than planned. “Yo guys, I love you so much, thank you for coming out,” Yungblud said in a voice memo shared to fans afterward. “That got a bit f—ing hectic, didn’t it?

The small satellite is now awaiting instrument calibration following a successful integration in Canada and rigorous testing by engineers at the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. StarBurst is designed to detect the initial emission of short gamma-ray bursts, some of the most powerful explosions in the universe and a key indicator of neutron star mergers. This would provide valuable insight into such events, which are also detected through gravitational waves by observatories on Earth. These events are where most of the heavy metals in the universe, such as gold and platinum, are formed. To date, only one such event has been observed simultaneously in gravitational waves and gamma-rays; StarBurst is expected to find up to 10 per year. StarBurst arrived at NASA Marshall in March 2025.
