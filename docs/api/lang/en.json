Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is rolling out a new setup screen that encourages users to enable the more reliable tracking setting for its Find Hub network. This setting allows the network to use a single device’s location data to find lost items, improving reliability in low-traffic areas. The new screen simplifies the options and explicitly warns that the default setting may make it harder to locate items in remote places. For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas. While it looks unlikely that Google will reverse this decision soon, the company is starting to nudge users to enable the network’s more reliable tracking setting.

The change, reported earlier this week by Good e-Reader, brings a welcome boost to endurance and should translate to nearly an extra week of reading time.

Reports span several models, but others say theirs still works, so the issue isn’t universal. Google hasn’t documented any changes to One-Handed Mode; we’ve reached out to the company for comment. A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",

From the notification panel to the Settings app to the lock screen and beyond, Google redesigned nearly every system interface visible to the user. However, Android is a huge OS, so Google missed a few parts during the initial overhaul, such as the Package Installer that handles sideloading apps.

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have identified a new banking malware that replaces your actual banking app with a malicious one. It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

It seems like most apps are trying to get us to pay a monthly — or yearly — subscription these days, a stark contrast to the times when getting full access required a single purchase. While most of the apps I use are free, and I can live with the ads and the limited feature set that come with them, there are a few that I gladly pay for every month. These apps roughly cost me around $65 every month but make my life easier in many ways. They help me stay on top of my finances, keep me organized, and make sure I can relax after a long, hard day. They are well worth the money, so I have zero regrets.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR The translation feature in Circle to Search now supports continuous scrolling. With Scroll and translate, you can continue to use your phone while it translates what’s on the screen. The feature has been limited to Samsung devices since it first launched in September, but is now rolling out to Pixel 6 and newer Pixel devices. Google started pushing the second quarterly Android 16 — QPR2 — update to the Pixel 6 and newer Pixels earlier this week. As with the first quarterly update, there is a significant emphasis on visual improvements . The Android QPR2 brings support for force-theming icons, a forced dark mode for apps that don’t inherently support it, additional accessibility features for better screen visibility, and more. One more feature that may have flown under the radar is the improvements the update brings to Circle to Search, and particularly how it handles translations. Until now, if you had to use Circle to Search for translations, it required capturing a screen and then waiting for translations. However, the new update includes a “ Scroll and translate ” option, allowing Circle to Search to translate text while you scroll…",

Painted by Texas students, the murals honor the legacy of the International Space Station and 25 years of continuous human presence in space.&nbsp; The International Space Station Program Mural Project began in 2022 as part of a broader effort to bring color and inspiration into the workplace while connecting classrooms to NASA’s mission.&nbsp; “Dream Big,” created by Texas City High School students with the International Space Station Program Mission and Program Integration team in 2025, symbolizes imagination becoming exploration. “The mural collection is a reminder that today’s dreams can be tomorrow’s realities,” said Space Operations Mission Directorate Deputy Associate Administrator Joel Montalbano. “The future of space exploration depends on the imagination of our students.”&nbsp; As NASA prepares for the next giant leap through Artemis , the art on the walls serves as a reminder that every mission begins with creativity and courage.

    "body": "TL;DR When Nuki launched its Smart Lock in the US, it introduced a $5.90/month Nuki Premium subscription. Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference. And today we’ve got a critical update on that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These clouds, called H II (‘H-two’) regions, are a sign that the galaxy is home to especially young, hot, and massive stars that blaze with high-energy radiation.

I question whether the hardware is mature enough to deliver on that dream, but one thing’s for sure: Samsung’s Galaxy XR comes closer to realizing it than Vision Pro.

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices.

This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch.

New lists available on Google TV devices and in the Google TV app highlight viewers’ “most watched” movies (James Gunn’s Superman is up there) and TV shows (Love Island is a hit), and a newly added advent calendar (prominently sponsored by Target) offers a different holiday movie to check out every day through Christmas.",
