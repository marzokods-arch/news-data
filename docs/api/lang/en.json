A veteran comedy roast master, she was one of the stars of Netflix’s 2024 flambé of NFL legend Tom Brady and then killed as the host of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, which got her invited back for next year’s ceremony.&nbsp; She also killed during that monologue — “Here I am in New York City, [Jeffrey] Epstein’s original island” — so it was a little disappointing to see her relegated to straight woman roles in most of the sketches.
