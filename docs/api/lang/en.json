Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist.

The singer &#8212; who previously stopped through NYC&#8217;s Madison Square Garden in October 2024 &#8212; was poised, energetic and appeared to be having the the time of her life on stage, playing the first of two back-to-back shows at the venue on her mammoth Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour supporting last year&#8217;s album of the same name. If anything, Eilish&#8217;s marathon time on the road since the trek kicked off two Septembers ago has only made her a stronger, sharper performer, with the star commanding her setlist of songs spanning all three of her studio albums, her debut EP Don&#8217;t Smile at Me and club-ready Charli xcx collaboration &#8220;Guess&#8221; with impressive stamina and musicality.

Yorke also addressed his personal grief following the death of his first wife, Dr. Rachel Owen, in late 2016. “I needed to stop anyway, because I hadn’t really given myself time to grieve,” he said. “My grief was coming out in ways that made me think, I need to take this away.” He added that while music was a source of healing, it also became a painful reminder. “There have been points in my life where I’ve looked for so…",
