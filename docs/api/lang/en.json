It runs on the T-Mobile network, but as an MVNO, it already undercuts the big three networks by a wide margin. However, a new offer that you won’t see advertised on the site makes its 12-month plans even cheaper. For a limited time, new customers can get 30% off all 12-month fixed-data plans using the code YEAROFMINT . That drops the 5GB plan from $15 to $10.50 per month, paid upfront for the year. The code should automatically apply if you use this link or widget below, but it’s worth noting down just in case.",

That process can be wildly complex, as in the case of generative video — but on the simpler end of the spectrum, AI can be very helpful for parsing large bodies of text to create concise summaries. Google’s started putting its AI to work in the latter way on the Play Store, where you’ll soon see AI-generated summaries of aggregated user app reviews. We were able to activate these AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store more than a year ago , but now, they’re starting to appear broadly, no fiddling required.

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

Unlike the CarPlay equivalent, the nascent feature — still codenamed “Earth” — is very rough around the edges and has several limitations.

The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S . Therefore, it could be speculated to be called the OnePlus 15T or 15S, in line with the naming convention for the recently launched flagship.",

At the time, it was unclear if this was a bug or a sign of an incoming change. It turns out that the answer was the latter. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The leak came from a private Google Teams call that someone joined and screenshotted before posting on a GrapheneOS forum. Pixel devices running standard Android still allow limited data access before first unlock, but GrapheneOS versions appear to block it more effectively. Google Pixel phones already have a solid reputation for security, but leaked Cellebrite documents show they’re even harder to crack when running GrapheneOS , the privacy-focused Android alternative. Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer. During the meeting, the uninvited participant took screenshots of what appears to be an internal ‘Android OS Access Support Matrix’ and then shared them on the GrapheneOS discussion forum .",

    "summary": "Android 17 could introduce a new “Min Mode” feature that lets apps display custom interfaces on the AOD.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new “Min Mode” feature for the Always-On Display that will allow apps to show their own minimal, persistent interfaces. This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

The X300 Pro is the higher-end model, offering a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto camera and a larger battery. The X300 starts at €1,049 (~$1,215), while the X300 Pro will cost €1,399 (~$1,620) This yeah, vivo is marking its 30th anniversary with two new flagships, the X300 and X300 Pro, and the highlights are simple: 200MP ZEISS imaging across the board, plus a fresh global debut for OriginOS 6. The formula here isn’t shock value; it’s a focused push on photography, performance, and long-term software support that reads like a confident year-over-year step rather than a gamble. Both phones lean hard on ZEISS hardware and tuning, but they take different routes to get there. The X300 pairs a 200MP Ultra-Sensing HPB main camera with a 50MP ZEISS APO telephoto (LYT-602) and a 50MP ultrawide (JN1). The Pro flips things for telephoto fans, using a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto as its centerpiece, backed by a 50MP “gimbal-grade” main camera (vivo × Sony LYT-828, 1/1.28-inch) and a 50MP ultrawide.

NotebookLM is easily one of Google’s most highly cherished AI tools , with fewer haters than any other of Google’s apps. It lets you research and process data from numerous different sources and convert verbose formats into digestible chunks, or even AI-generated podcasts and video essays. With an upcoming update, Google is set to improve file support for free users. Google Drive integration already lets you import files from Docs and Slides as sources to NotebookLM. But the research tool lacks support for Google Sheets (or .XLS and .XLSX files) in the free tier. Thankfully, if you’ve been yearning for the option to import your Sheets or Excel files to NotebookLM, Google may be bringing it to you soon.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Starting today, T-Mobile will only allow payment arrangements through the T-Life app. In-store and customer support call options previously required a fee, but have now been discontinued entirely. The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Those screens won’t integer scale DS games, and the SoC is too weak for the MelonDS emulator. The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

The chipset is expected to be built on TSMC’s newer N3P fabrication process, which is also used for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It follows a similar design to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, including Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, but with a lower clock speed than the Elite Gen 5. In addition to launching the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 earlier than usual this year, Qualcomm also confirmed it is working on the non-Elite variant of the chipset. The standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 has yet to hit the market, but Qualcomm has already shared some specifics about the chipset, including a vague description of the CPU. Now, a recent leak is plugging any previous gap in information with more details. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared specifications for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, including its CPU and GPU . Per the leak, the chipset is set to be fabricated on TSMC’s N3P 3nn process, identical to the Elite edition. This is TSMC’s third-gen 3nm process, which offers marginal gains in performance and efficiency over the N3E process that was utilized for the Snapdragon 8 Elite from last year.",

Camera history scrolling is smoother on iOS, and all users get a cleaner camera viewer. Nest x Yale Lock gains new features like lock history, notifications, and Android passcode editing. Google Home updates are being released thick and fast, perhaps because the company is aware that eyes are on it following its major overhaul . Google is pushing out version 4.2 of the Google Home app, arriving just days after the last update . The rollout brings various improvements for camera and Nest x Yale Lock owners, while also aiming to prevent the Android app from crashing — or at least make it crash less often. According to the Google support page , version 4.2 addresses two separate issues that were causing the app to crash on Android. That will come as a welcome relief to users, given how central the Home app is to managing the rest of Google’s smart home hardware.",
