While the concept made waves, it ultimately settled into a more traditional unit-based structure — an ambitious experiment that achieved only partial success. However, leading this experiment even further is a K-pop label and creative house ready to take it head-on: MODHAUS. As a part of the label’s strategy, the act’s members are introduced one by one rather than being revealed all at once, and fans actively participate in shaping unit combinations through voting. All of this interaction takes place on COSMO, the company’s proprietary fan platform — distinct from HYBE’s Weverse or paid messaging services like Bubble — designed specifically to support MODHAUS’ participatory system.

The alternatives may convey slightly different meaning, or offer different levels of formality. Google could introduce this option alongside the “Understand” and “Ask” buttons we saw earlier. Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others. While it sometimes misreports facts, “ hallucinating ” details, it tends to do a pretty decent job at stringing a few words together — even incorrect results don’t end up sounding like gibberish. That makes translation a pretty obvious target for AI’s skill set, and today we’ve spotted what looks like some new AI-powered functionality Google’s working on for its Translate app. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

    "body": "TL;DR Android Headlines has published what it calls an “official” leaked render of the Pixel 10a. The render shows the purported Pixel 10a in what we assume is the Obsidian colorway. The Pixel 10a is rumored to be launching in the next few weeks. We first saw unofficial renders of the Pixel 10a published by Android Headlines back in October . Today, the outlet is back at it with a leak of what it says is the first official render published of Google’s upcoming midranger. There’s nothing surprising in the render itself, but the timing of the leak does line up nicely with a rumor from earlier this morning pointing to a 10a release in the coming weeks. The render Android Headlines published today shows a purported Pixel 10a that looks nearly indistinguishable from last year’s Pixel 9a at a glance, though size and layout of the camera cutout, flash, and Google G lettermark are all subtly different. The phone in the render is sporting some considerably thick bezels, a notable difference from previous (unofficial) CAD renders, which featured a thinner border around the phone’s display.",

This time, AYN has confirmed that its dual-screen Thor will get more expensive when the next batch of pre-orders opens later this month. The good news is there’s still a brief window to lock in the current pricing, if you’re quick. According to an update shared on AYN’s Discord (via NotebookCheck ), the company will raise prices when Batch 3 pre-orders open on January 20. AYN directly attributes the increase to higher memory costs. As a result, the Base model will go up by $10, while the Pro and Max variants will each see a $20 bump.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has removed its egg-hatching mini-game from the Gaming Hub app for its Android devices. The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",

While the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of AT&amp;T, the 2nd Circuit ruled in favor of the government over Verizon. The Supreme Court is now being asked to step in and make a final ruling that will apply to both, though the decision won’t likely arrive until the summer of 2026. After it determined Verizon and AT&amp;T had willfully violated the law by failing to protect customer location data, the FCC previously ordered AT&amp;T and Verizon to pay roughly $57 million and $47 million, respectively. While both companies paid the fines as expected, they also opted to sue over the matter independently. Now the Supreme Court is getting involved as well, as reported by The Hill .

AYANEO has been a trailblazer in retro gaming handheld designs, but when it comes to customer service, it lags far behind the competition. Crowdfunded products are frequently delayed for months with little to no communication, and after-market support is both slow and often ineffective. Things came to a head in the past few weeks, with many fans and popular reviewers such as Retro Handhelds , Retro Game Corps , and others openly criticizing the company’s practices and even threatening a boycott.

Apple’s advantage stemmed from premium demand, a delayed upgrade cycle, and strong sales across multiple iPhone generations. Google and Nothing both posted strong growth, but 2026 could be tougher as rising component costs hit the broader Android market. Apple and Samsung have spent years trading blows at the top of the global smartphone market, often separated by slim margins and the timing of big launches. In 2025, though, Apple didn’t just come out ahead — it managed to widen the gap. According to figures from Counterpoint Research , global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-on-year in 2025, marking the second straight year of growth. Apple finished the year with a 20% share of global shipments and 10% YoY growth, while Samsung followed with a 19% share and 5% growth. The result was a clearer lead for Apple than in 2024.",

This phone would’ve been the long-awaited sequel to 2023’s OnePlus Open. There’s also a “90% chance” that the OnePlus 15s will be canceled. The OnePlus Open is the brand’s first and only foldable phone to date, but it’s been more than two years since its release. We’ve been hoping for a OnePlus Open 2, but it looks like OnePlus has other ideas. Leaker Yogesh Brar claimed on Twitter that OnePlus has canceled the OnePlus Open 2. This would be disappointing news if confirmed, and means global users would be deprived of what could be a high-quality foldable.",

Twitter tipster Ice Universe posted more apparent information about this shooting mode, corroborating reports that it needs to be enabled in the Camera Assistant app first. Once you’ve turned on this feature, it’ll be available as an option in the Galaxy S26’s default camera app.",

Many of us probably owe a huge debt to streaming platforms for shaping our musical tastes and expanding our libraries. While the music streaming space has grown with both bigger libraries and a variety of new players, many of today’s top streaming platforms are quickly morphing into the very antithesis of the formula that made them such a game-changer.

See, I’m loath to fork out for Google One when I have 10TB of hard drive space on my NAS. Still, I use Google Photos to make the occasional quick edit, to help share snaps with friends and family quickly, and even duplicate a few of my most cherished memories as part of the recommended 3-2-1 backup rule . For storing most of my older snaps, I’ve been using PhotoPrism, but as good as it is as a photo library, it lacks the rich feature set of Photos, especially for managing multiple users in my home.",
