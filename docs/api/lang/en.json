The demo builds on earlier versions, such as Google Martha, showing Gemini identifying objects and offering real-time assistance. Magic Leap has extended its partnership with Google by three years and will act as an AR ecosystem partner, rather than a hardware maker. It’s only been a week since Samsung kicked off the Android XR era with its Galaxy XR headset , but Google’s already looking beyond bulky headsets to something much lighter. At the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event in Riyadh, Google and Magic Leap showed off a new Android XR glasses prototype — the first time we’ve seen Google concept glasses on stage since I/O in the summer. As reported by Android Central , the two companies also confirmed they’ve extended their partnership for another three years. Magic Leap first teamed up with Google in 2024, combining its optics and manufacturing know-how with Google’s AI and display technology.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The leak came from a private Google Teams call that someone joined and screenshotted before posting on a GrapheneOS forum. Pixel devices running standard Android still allow limited data access before first unlock, but GrapheneOS versions appear to block it more effectively. Google Pixel phones already have a solid reputation for security, but leaked Cellebrite documents show they’re even harder to crack when running GrapheneOS , the privacy-focused Android alternative. Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer. During the meeting, the uninvited participant took screenshots of what appears to be an internal ‘Android OS Access Support Matrix’ and then shared them on the GrapheneOS discussion forum .",

    "summary": "Android 17 could introduce a new “Min Mode” feature that lets apps display custom interfaces on the AOD.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new “Min Mode” feature for the Always-On Display that will allow apps to show their own minimal, persistent interfaces. This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

The X300 starts at €1,049 (~$1,215), while the X300 Pro will cost €1,399 (~$1,620) This yeah, vivo is marking its 30th anniversary with two new flagships, the X300 and X300 Pro, and the highlights are simple: 200MP ZEISS imaging across the board, plus a fresh global debut for OriginOS 6. The formula here isn’t shock value; it’s a focused push on photography, performance, and long-term software support that reads like a confident year-over-year step rather than a gamble. Both phones lean hard on ZEISS hardware and tuning, but they take different routes to get there. The X300 pairs a 200MP Ultra-Sensing HPB main camera with a 50MP ZEISS APO telephoto (LYT-602) and a 50MP ultrawide (JN1). The Pro flips things for telephoto fans, using a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto as its centerpiece, backed by a 50MP “gimbal-grade” main camera (vivo × Sony LYT-828, 1/1.28-inch) and a 50MP ultrawide.

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Those screens won’t integer scale DS games, and the SoC is too weak for the MelonDS emulator. The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

    "body": "TL;DR Details about Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 (non-Elite variant) have leaked. The chipset is expected to be built on TSMC’s newer N3P fabrication process, which is also used for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It follows a similar design to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, including Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, but with a lower clock speed than the Elite Gen 5. In addition to launching the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 earlier than usual this year, Qualcomm also confirmed it is working on the non-Elite variant of the chipset. The standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 has yet to hit the market, but Qualcomm has already shared some specifics about the chipset, including a vague description of the CPU. Now, a recent leak is plugging any previous gap in information with more details. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared specifications for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, including its CPU and GPU . Per the leak, the chipset is set to be fabricated on TSMC’s N3P 3nn process, identical to the Elite edition. This is TSMC’s third-gen 3nm process, which offers marginal gains in performance and efficiency over the N3E process that was utilized for the Snapdragon 8 Elite from last year.",

And yet, with the OnePlus 15 , I find myself feeling rather conflicted. OnePlus did a lot right with the phone, and its commitment to performance, battery, and charging is more evident than ever. But at the same time, OnePlus sacrificed other parts of its identity to the point where I’m not even sure I recognize this as a OnePlus phone.",

Bigme has launched the HiBreak S, a device that blurs the line between smartphone and e-reader, all at an affordable price point. While BOOX’s new Palma 2 Pro looks the part but lacks full voice-calling support, the HiBreak S delivers connectivity and a starting price that makes it the most affordable color E Ink phone to date. The HiBreak S features a 5.84-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display, available in both color and black-and-white variants. The panel’s matte finish keeps reflections to a minimum, while a 36-level front light with adjustable color temperature makes it easy to read in any lighting.

One of these is a refreshed Quick Settings panel, which is expected to become more dynamic and customizable with this future update. Although One UI 8.5 is likely to arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series — and the beta isn’t coming for the whole of November either, plenty of leaks have given us an overview of these design changes. While a revamped Quick Settings panel has already been spotted in previously leaked builds of One UI 8.5, the latest leak gives us a better look at additional options it could bring.

It’s unclear how this new device will differ from last year’s Rabbit R1. The AI frenzy we’re currently living through will be remembered for a lot of things: the explosion of data centers and attendant rise in electricity prices ; generative slop flooding social media; and executives bragging about paying fewer workers, to name a few. Possibly the most tangible pop culture artifact of this AI era, though, is the standalone AI gadget. Devices like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 , both released last year, were designed to connect us directly to AI-powered services without graphical user interfaces getting in the way. These first-gen AI baubles were nearly universally panned — but evidently, Rabbit is ready to give it another try as early as next year.",

Search Live might be getting an “Interrupt Live responses” toggle, along with live captions. There’s also a potential new way to add AI Mode to your search, as well as tweaks to Gemini’s image markup tools. Some updates to the Google app are pretty routine, but not this week. We’ve been digging around in the latest beta of the app (version 16.43.60.sa.arm64 beta) and by enabling some internal settings, we’ve spotted a few interesting features in testing. It looks like Google’s laying the groundwork for even more flexibility with its AI experiences, including a smoother way to use Search Live.

Other key changes include improved stereo speakers, fewer microphones (three vs four), and an upgraded vapor chamber for cooling. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 15 in China this week, positioning itself as a contender for the best next-gen Android flagship . We expect to see the OnePlus 15 make its way to global markets soon, so if you haven’t already bought a OnePlus flagship, you shouldn’t buy one until the new flagship launches.

The Pocket G2 remains available for sale, but it’s unclear when the Pocket 6 will be relaunched. Retroid is one of the most popular brands in Android gaming handhelds , but it seems like every new product the company releases is immediately mired in controversy. The highly anticipated Pocket 6, which follows the fan-favorite Pocket 5, has once again proven this true, as it has now been pulled from pre-sale after less than a day. While fans are pleased with the pricing and the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the physical design of the handheld has been met with widespread disapproval in the community. The new row of buttons beneath the screen, which gives it a more retro look, reduces the overall screen-to-body ratio, and some feel that it’s a step backwards.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 16 introduces “seamless app updates” to make installing app updates faster and less disruptive. This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Gemini shortcut, part of the Google app, on Android now uses a true black background instead of gray. Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

However, despite its current limitations, we managed to get it working and can now show you how the whole process of adding widgets to your Android Auto home screen will work and what these widgets could look like when they finally arrive.

    "summary": "Closing that AutoPay loophole last week makes a lot more sense now.",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile’s app now mentions a “T-Mobile Visa credit card” as an eligible AutoPay payment option. A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

    "body": "TL;DR Threat intelligence firm Synthient recently aggregated a set of 183 million compromised accounts that were inaccurately attributed to a Gmail breach. Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
