Producer Roy Lee didn't reveal much about the film, but hinted at a potentially lengthy wait: \"Well, 'The Long Walk' became a reality because 'BioShock' was delayed for a little bit where we had to do some more script work. And so as the script work is being done, we shot 'The Long Walk,' and [Francis Lawrence] was already committed to doing the next 'Hunger Games' movie. And so it's just waiting for him whenever the 'Hunger Games' is completed, and the script is just being worked on right now.\" Lee was referring to Sunrise on the Reaping, a Hunger Games prequel focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's Games.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor are both on sale on Steam at a steep discount through September 23. Fallen Order is 75% off, bringing it down to just $10, and Survivor is 80% off, taking it down to $14. The deluxe version of Survivor is only 70% off, but that still makes it just $26. Both of these games are a bargain at those prices, especially considering they're among the best games in the Star Wars franchise, at least in my opinion. If you enjoy soulslikes, it's definitely worth giving Fallen Order a try. It follows former-Jedi-in-hiding Cal Kestis as he travels the galaxy trying to heal his connection to the Force after the events of Order 66, all while searching for a missing holocron. It's set about five years after Revenge of the Sith, so you'll be fighting loads of stormtroopers and inquisitors. Jedi: Survivor picks up about five years after Fallen Order and continues Cal Kestis's story, this time with a closer look into the rebellion and how it's faring against the Empire. While Jedi: Survivor isn't perfect, and had a rocky start at launch, it has a solid story and…",

Everyone is being so goddamn annoying . Last Thursday, with Steam buckling and Silksong on everybody's lips, I was at the nadir of my excitement, predicting a sea of perfect 10s that would look embarrassing in a year's time. It seemed like it could be one of those games where, once everything dies down, the consensus becomes \"Yeah, it was pretty good, but we all got way too worked up about it.\" The Bioshock: Infinite special. I didn't always feel sour about the collective Silksanity or its quirky outflows⁠—I still have to put some respect on the commitment of Daily Silksong News , a worthy successor to the Daily Elden Ring Update ⁠—but the final crescendo of excitement, memes, and (worst of all) discourse just chafed my hams: Silksong's hype and anticipation had entered the realm of the absurd or parodical, a performance carried out on Reddit for th…",

Like most sensible people, I long ago wrote off the Postal series as an idea that started terribly, enjoyed some fleeting glory in the same wave of cultural disaffection that brought us Limp Bizkit and the Attitude Era, and has spent the decades since thrashing around in search of relevance. Yet several times over the last few years, I've heard furtive whispers from various corners of the internet that there is one Postal game which is actually, genuinely good. No, I'm not referring to Postal 2 , which despite inexplicably having the same Steam rating as Half-Life 2 , is a pretty shoddy game.

    "body": "More quizzes! (Image credit: Larian Studios, PC Gamer) Want to keep testing your knowledge of gaming trivia? We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. What can we say about videogame movies? Not that they're good, certainly—they usually aren't, with a handful of begrudging exceptions. Nor that they're particularly faithful to or even respectful of the series we love, most of the time. But we can definitely say that they exist. In other words, they are undeniably a part of this great tapestry we call gaming, and we can't just dismiss them. Hide in ignorance, and you're liable to be ambushed by a new Resident Evil movie at an inopportune time—most embarrassing. (Image credit: Warner Bros. / Mojang) In fact, I think it's time we all brushed up on our knowledge of some of Hollywood's least favoured children, which is why I've put together a quiz covering the full breadth of videogame movies. Give it a try, and see how much trivia about movies you didn't actually like has stuck in your brain over the years. Let us know how you did—and tell us your favourite (or least favourite) videogame movie—in the comments below!",

    "body": "\"Have you ever wanted to just be a worm for a day?\" asks Riley Neville, the creator of the wacky annelid simulator Wirm. To which my response is \"Not until now.\" Crawling through the ground while pushing dirt through my pink and boneless body has, you'll be surprised to hear, never sounded like a fun time. But the adorable trailer for Neville's upcoming physics platformer has got me wondering whether I'm somehow missing out. Wirm belongs to the same floppy family of games as Bennett Foddy's QWOP and Getting Over It , a 2D adventure about bypassing obstacles in a form ill-suited to navigating rough terrain. Yet where Foddy's games have an emphasis on challenge, Wirm appears to adopt a gentler approach—more about the low-key joys of being a worm than getting your ass kicked as one. Wirm furnishes you with the full powers of a limbless invertebrate. Your peristaltic locomotion allows you to crawl over most obstacles, and those which cannot be overcome may be, er, undercome by digging through surrounding soil. Finally, you'll be able to embrace that most commonly understood annelid ability—flying through space. I'm not joking. The trailer for Wirm mainly depicts said worm travelling t…",

Yet before it became the architect of lavish Japanese islands, Sucker Punch developed the Infamous games for Sony, and before that , it was known mainly for Sly Cooper. A likeable, if unremarkable, series of stealth action games starring an anthropomorphic raccoon, Sly Cooper had its heyday in the PS2 era. It was last seen in 2013 in a game not developed by Sucker Punch. Despite being more than 20 years and two series out from its Sly Cooper days, there are fans who still hope Sucker Punch will return to the game that put the studio on the map. But Ghost of Yotei co-director Nate Fox poured cold water on such optimism, as hardly anybody employed at Sucker Punch would be interested in reviving Sly Cooper. In an interview with MinnMax (via GamesRadar ) Fox was asked by host Ben Hanson what percentage of Sucker Punch devs would be up for making a new Sly Cooper game, to which Fox instantly responded \"ten percent\". Hanson was slightly taken aback, so Fox clarified that \"It's been a l…",

The original game, which released way back in 2011, boiled down the infamous complexity of the genre into a more accessible turn-based strategy, focussing primarily on tactical manoeuvres and managing supply lines rather than any base building or faffing around with economics. The sequel ingeniously expands and elaborates upon this simple premise, resulting in one of the best strategy games you can play today, and you can get it right now for a tactically sound 85% off. Unity of Command 2 is based upon the same ideas as the original, all about defeating enemy armies using clever positioning and thinking ahead. Your units' attack power is governed not just by their equipment or experience, but their locations relative to the landscape and both friendly and enemy units, as well as their connection to your army's supply lines. Indeed, the supply mechanic sits right at the heart of Unity of Command, dictating your units' ability to function. If an enemy captures one of your supply depots, it will inhibit units' ability to attack and, eventually, move at all. Likewise, if you can sneak behind an enemy frontline a…",

Tainted Grail's unusual world and intriguing questlines more than made up for a few rough edges, as Sam Desatoff explained in his Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon review . \"Every NPC has something worthwhile to contribute, and most of them offer side quests that add new wrinkles to the larger story,\" he wrote back in June. \"They can also be surprisingly funny: you'll help a nobleman fake his death to get out of a loveless marriage, uncover the lair of an undead chef chasing the next great meal, assist a woman who accidentally turned her husband into a pig, and more.\" Questline has updated Tainted Grail sporadically since launch. But the latest patch— v1.1 —is by far the biggest yet. Not only does it squash a vast array of bugs nibbling at the RPG's underbelly, but it also adds several major features and a bunch of new locations for players to explore.

The 3D spot is a staple of Battlefield that Battlefield Studios has no plans of abandoning again, but it agrees with players who thought spotting, and especially the Recon's auto-spotting ability, was way too powerful in the open beta. In a recent interview with IGN , console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said changes are coming in the final game. \"We definitely reduced the range and overall reduced the power,\" Nickerson said. \"We found out a lot in open beta that it was obviously very strong, just like players said. Really, players ended up just shooting Doritos. Light environments, dark environments—they were just like, ‘Hey, aim at the Dorito.

The studio stands accused of taking a very cool new armor set, which had been intended to be a reward from the returning Iron Banner activity, and instead placing it inside the Eververse Store where it sells for 1,500 Silver per character—$15 in real money. The shambles goes back to September 9, when the Destiny 2 team announced the return of the Iron Banner PvP mode, \"with new weapons to earn and an incredibly cool new set of armor .\" A couple days later, though, Bungie unveiled the new Iron Banner armor and it was in fact \"reprised\" armor , which is to say a reskin of old armor—and not an especially impressive one in the eyes of Destiny 2 fashionistas.

Initial critical response was fairly positive, but some sites— including PC Gamer —didn't receive pre-release code and were unable to offer their own opinions at launch. And once the clock hit go time, early Steam reviews were dominated by reports of performance issues and crashes that we experienced in our own early performance analysis . While it looks like Borderlands 4 still has a few kinks to hammer out, it does serve up one of the better features we've seen in the series: A chance to finally, mercifully silence Claptrap—and only Claptrap. (Image credit: 2K) Yes, Borderlands 4 has a volume slider specifically for its flagship failure robot, letting you completely mute the shrieks, shouts, and general insufferability Claptrap has forced us to endure since 2009. Technically, this isn't the freshest news: Some had noticed the slider during prerelease demos . But it's about time. Society has evolved beyond the need for Claptrap. I'm just not sure we deserve that peace. Part of me thinks that the bespoke Claptrap slider doesn't go far enough—that we should instead be given a Claptrap equivalent of an arachnophobia mode, replacing him wit…",

However, most of this just involved enabling upscaling and frame generation. Borderlands 4 is just plain hard on your hardware.

JUPITER itself is built around 50 container modules over a 2,300 square meter site, and contains a simply astonishing amount of hardware . The Booster module contains roughly 6,000 nodes, over which 24,000 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips are interconnected via the company's Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking system, complete with a slew of Arm-based CPU cores, 288 per node. The Cluster module, interlinked with Booster, is made up of more than 1300 nodes containing a wealth of Rhea1 processors, another Arm instruction set chip and designed by SiPearl. Each cluster node has two of these chips, with each containing 80 Arm Neoverse Zeus cores.

Balatro creator LocalThunk announced the delay today, and offered a relatable excuse: \"I'm slow.\" After apologizing for the delay, LocalThunk said he probably shouldn't have announced a release target for the 1.1 update in the first place: He's a \"hobbyist developer at heart,\" who unfortunately became \"all too familiar with the crunch and stress that inherently come with professional game development\" following the launch of Balatro in 2023. By the time the mobile edition of Balatro launched in late 2024, he was \"well and truly burned out.\" \"I took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025 when I very slowly eased myself back into the work,\" LocalThunk wrote. \"However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist (a few hours per day, and not always on the 1.1 update), and it turns out that it’s a lot slower than working in cru…",

Yesterday, a coworker shared a link to a little browser game that looked right up PC Gamer's alley: Doomscroll , a top-down shooter played entirely with a scroll wheel. You move your little Doom-guy facsimile down a hall, automatically shooting forward while dodging flanking sprites. Occasionally, you pass by plaques etched with actual New York Times headlines from the current day, completing the doomscrolling wordplay. It was kinda fun: I played a few runs, unlocked some upgrades, and experienced brief whiplash after locking eyes with two headlines about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After, I clicked over to a newsletter the developer wrote about making the game. Doomscroll is a side project of filmmaker and writer David Friedman, who describes in detail how he generated the entire game using ChatGPT. \"As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real. So naturally, I turned to vibe coding for this,\" Friedman wrote. Friedman goes on to describe his process of telling the chatbot…",

    "body": "Finding a way to Verdania in Hollow Knight: Silksong is kinda confusing. It's definitely one of the most complex regions to reach, especially as I'm pretty sure it's entirely optional. First off, actually visiting it requires you to unlock Act 3 , which is a whole elaborate process in itself. You'll also have to complete some additional unrelated steps before that. If you hadn't clocked it, this all involves the Green Prince—a mysterious grasshopper (he might be a cricket…) you can rescue in Sinner's Road. Visiting Verdania is related to his overall journey. Obviously, this guide will contain some spoilers for the Act 3 main quest (as far as having to progress it to reach Verdania is concerned), so leave now if you're not there yet. Otherwise, here's how to unlock Verdania as an area and help the Green Prince. How to unlock Verdania in Silksong As mentioned above, you can't get to Verdania until you're in Act 3 , and even then, you'll have to jump through some hoops first. I suggest doing these first three stages during Act 2, because I can't 100% confirm you still can in Act 3.

Maximum Frame Gen (2x for RTX 40-series owners, 4x for RTX 50-series cards), DLSS cranked to the guns—even the mighty RTX 5080 , a $1,000+ GPU, appears to need a hefty dose of both to achieve 60 fps+ at 1440p resolution.

Long gone are the days of separate zones; now we can walk from end to end with no interruptions—besides killing hordes of bandits, of course. However, this change has always made navigation that much more complicated, as we're not restricted by closed-off locales and predictable corridors anymore. Because of this, Gearbox made the baffling decision to remove the traditional minimap in favour of a compass at the top of the screen. Sure, the compass is useful for getting your bearings, but it's also completely useless in pinpointing enemies in combat. There's a psycho to your northeast, but they could be standing right in front of you or ten blocks away. See what I mean?

As I write this, there's been no official response from Gearbox about the game's technical issues, but it has put out a statement on another complaint that's cropped up, much more rarely but still visible here and there in negative user reviews: Borderlands 4's terms of service. You may recall that previous Borderlands games on Steam were review-bombed earlier this year because of changes in their EULAs. There were also claims that Take-Two, the parent of Borderlands developer Gearbox, had made the changes because it intended to implement kernel-level anti-cheat in Borderlands 4, which it would then use to gain personal information from its players. It was all a bit (or a lot) overblown, as PC Gamer's Tyler Colp pointed out: \"a misleading YouTube video prompting fans to play a game of telephone about the changes to the EULA over Reddit and forum threads, and a bout of short-lived Steam review bombing that hasn't accomplished much of anything.\" Those review bombings did indeed have little impact…",

And on PC, there's one more thing you can throw into the mix: every major Borderlands game has run like a bag of frogs juggling bowling balls on release. Which is to say, not very well. Post-launch patches solve most of the issues in time, but stutters, hitches, and relatively low frame rates are the norm for the series, so my expectations for Borderlands 4's launch performance weren't very high. And sure enough, it needs work. I've tested Borderlands 4 on two gaming PCs: one that just meets the minimum system requirements ( Core i7 9700K , Radeon RX 5700 XT , 16 GB DDR4-3200) and one that's a top–end gaming rig ( Ryzen 7 9800X3D , GeForce RTX 5090 , 32 GB DDR5-6000). Note: Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared. It didn't come with any patch notes, so I have no idea what it fixed or added, but I can say that it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs. Most .

Those are just a couple of the reasons some gamers have chosen to reject launch day hype in favor of \"patient gaming\": Waiting a year or more to play new games, which means getting them cheaper during a sale and playing them after a bunch of big performance and quality-of-life patches have likely made them much better than they were at launch. There's even a pretty active subreddit dedicated to the idea : the main rule is that you're not allowed to post about games that are under a year old. But there's also a reason HBO's servers sometimes struggled with Sunday night demand at the height of Game of Thrones' popularity. There's something special about being there on day one (before they edit out the Starbucks cups ) and reacting and emoting with the crowd.
