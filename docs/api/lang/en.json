    "body": "Cardi B and Nicki Minaj have a complicated history dating back to about 2017. Fans began to speculate about whether or the not the two New York City rappers liked each other as they clamored for them to collaborate and show solidarity for the sake of the five boroughs after the Bronx rapper bursted on the scene with her smash record &#8220;Bodak Yellow.&#8221; The two would finally link up, albeit unknowingly, on the Culture II single &#8220; MotorSport &#8221; alongside the Migos — which was well received at first, but then was quickly mired in controversy after Cardi suggested on London&#8217;s Capital Xtra radio show that Minaj may&#8217;ve edited her verse. &#8220;Well, you know, when I heard the track, her verse wasn&#8217;t finished,&#8221; Cardi B said . &#8220;Or it&#8217;s not the verse that it&#8217;s on right now. And Quavo told me that to get on the song, and I just felt like it&#8217;s a perfect opportunity for me to be on a track that&#8217;s big like them. Cause those are two big people, and I just started in the game. And I just know if I get on this record, it&#8217;s gonna be crazy.

And how will the judge decide that question? Billboard turned to the experts to find out. According to Tama Kudman, a veteran defense attorney at the law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner LLP, much will depend on whether the judge sticks to that limited verdict.

Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device.

Wearables have increasingly been hailed as guardians of human lives. Close-to-medical-grade detection techniques already alert us to certain conditions, even before symptoms progress in the body. While hypertension , sleep apnea , or Atrial Fibrillation can now be commonly detected on smartwatches, AI is enhancing the scope of detection and utility, accelerating detection with fewer data points.

However, if you already pay for a Gemini subscription, these perks can be availed without an additional subscription. Google just released a suite of new Home devices with Gemini, replacing Google Assistant on yet another platform. As part of its announcement, Google has also announced new features that will enrich how you use and interact with myriad smart devices compatible with the Google Home app . With Gemini’s integration , the Google Home app on Android is getting a conversational interface. As with other Gemini applications, the idea is to make chores feel more effortless. For instance, you can ask about specific events captured by various outdoor or indoor cameras. In such an event, it should find relevant clips in a matter of seconds, thereby eliminating the need for manual scrubbing. These are part of a new feature called “Ask Home.”",

Oura just addressed one of the biggest gripes about its smart rings : charging on the go. The company has unveiled a new portable charging case capable of storing up to five full charges. This update helps Oura catch up in a space where rivals have a head start.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation.",

As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it.

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",

Much of the skepticism is driven by a fear of product abandonment, poor software performance, or Gemini making basic controls worse. Some commenters remain hopeful about the platform’s future. It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future. The original piece argued that new hardware, a redesigned Home app, and the integration of Gemini could finally put Google’s smart home back on track. However, the comments reve…",

Now, we’ve seen a handful of the wallpapers the phone might ship with — and got a possible idea of when the phone could launch. On Telegram, the Mystic Leaks channel recently shared five abstract, colorful images, apparently wallpapers for the yet-unannounced Pixel 10a.

But while there’s no confirmation about the Galaxy S26 series’ launch timeline, we now have another piece of evidence supporting the fact that it will not be a Snapdragon-only affair . Samsung’s semiconductor division has reportedly kicked off mass production of the slated Exynos 2600 chipset.

However, if history is any indication, I think you should look elsewhere. Security cameras are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them are so cheap that it’s ludicrous to consider something as expensive as a $100-200 Nest Cam. Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this. But after careful consideration, I couldn’t justify paying this much on a Nest Cam and committing to a monthly subscription. I looked into Nest Cam alternatives and landed on the TP-Link Tapo C225 () instead. I couldn’t be happier with my choice. Here’s why.",

However, when you’re allowing other people to connect to your audio stream, you must either pair another pair of headphones manually or scan a QR code using another phone that’s already connected to those headphones.

The tab brings an organized feed of your progress and achievements from different games and apps. With this update, Google is also expanding semantic search using AI. The Google Play Store is, for most people, the default destination to download apps on Android devices. Over the years, it has been refined and undergone several changes to make it easier to discover more apps with fewer steps. And now, Google is seeding another updated version intended to improve app search and keep a tab on your activity and achievements across different apps and games. Google has released a new Play Store update, bumping its version to 48.2. Among the significant changes introduced by the update is a new “You” tab, which replaces the Books tab in the bottom bar. Here, you can find personalized content to help you make better use of the apps and games already installed on your phone. Although we don’t have the update yet, Google shared some information in a recent blog post that provides more details about the new tab.",

After Samsung kickstarted the trend earlier this year, and Apple just brought it back into the spotlight, it appears that Motorola is the next company to throw its hat into the thin phone ring. The official Motorola account on Weibo recently published a teaser image for the Moto X70 Air, and it takes just one look to see that this is a phone designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air .

Today, Nothing’s budget sub-brand, CMF, has launched its own pair of over-ears — and they’re predictably a lot cheaper while still coming packed with features. The CMF Headphone Pro , initially teased earlier this month , is now listed on Nothing’s web store. We haven’t gone ears-on with the new cans yet, but their spec sheet looks pretty stacked.

This is notable because it’s the first MediaTek Dimensity chipset we know of that can run Android’s Linux Terminal app. Alongside the Galaxy Tab S11, the Xiaomi 15T series also supports the Linux Terminal — but only after updating to Android 16. Big Android tablets are incredible devices for media consumption, but their productivity capabilities are all over the place. While a few large tablets can replace laptops for some people, most are, at best, just giant notepads. The new Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is firmly in the former category with its massive OLED display and an array of Samsung-exclusive multitasking features. Thanks to the addition of Linux app support, however, its computing capabilities transcend those of almost any other Android tablet. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Considering how easily your smartphone snaps a picture, shoots a video, or records a voice memo, it should be a lot more shocking than it is that so many Android users still struggle to access basic voice call recording. A complicated legal framework certainly doesn’t help matters any, but a few weeks back we found ourselves newly hopeful that things were getting better, as Google updated its support documentation to indicate that call recording was coming to Pixel 6 and newer devices. Despite that change, reports of users actually getting access were hard to come by — was this happening or not? Today, we’re finally getting some insight into what Google’s up to.

The update will expand this to nearly all shared storage, making file sharing much easier. The Linux Terminal app can transform your Android phone into a full-fledged mobile PC by giving you access to powerful tools not natively available on the platform. With it, you can use readily available Linux programs to turn your device into a web server, convert media files, run AI models locally, and much more. Many of these tools work with local files, but sharing them between the Android host and the Linux virtual machine is currently a hassle.

People have a problem with randomness. We don’t understand it, we have trouble recognizing it, and we often don’t even use the right words to describe it (no, your roommate’s friend’s dog walker is not a “random” addition to your party — they are there expressly because of those existing relationships). This is as true as ever when we’re talking about shuffling a media playlist. While a capital-r random order could include every song alphabetically, the same song over and over again, or not even change the playback order at all, when we say “random” what we tend to actually mean is “different and new.” And now it looks like Spotify is working on some new tools intended to help give listeners just that.
