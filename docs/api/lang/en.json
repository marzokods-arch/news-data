Both pop dynamos had been nominated in all of the Big&nbsp;Four general categories, and for best new artist, they were surrounded by potential spoilers, including Shaboozey, whose “A&nbsp;Bar Song (Tipsy)” had logged the most weeks atop the Billboard Hot&nbsp;100 in 2024; Teddy Swims, whose “Lose Control” eventually broke the Hot&nbsp;100 longevity record; and other new-school stars like Benson Boone, Doechii and RAYE. Ultimately, Roan emerged victorious — and delivered an instantly memorable acceptance speech that advocated for artists’ wages and health care. Eight months later, a fresh class of best new artist hopefuls is eager for such a moment at the 68th annual Grammys — but in a race that looks nothing like the previous one.

Born in Minneapolis and raised in Gainesville, Fla. — his late brother Tom played with fellow Gainesvillian Tom Petty — Leadon grew up steeped in bluegrass and acoustic traditions. His early work with Dillard &amp; Clark and on the Burrito Brothers&#8217; second and third albums fused traditional instrumentation with progressive songwriting, laying the foundation for what would later be dubbed Americana. In 1971, he co-founded the Eagles with Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner, helping craft the band&#8217;s signature sound meshing country and rock. His contributions — on guitar, banjo, pedal steel and mandolin — defined early Eagles albums such as the band&#8217;s self-titled debut, Desperado and One of These Nights .

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
