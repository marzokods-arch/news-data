    "body": "Growing up in New York City, I’ve watched footwear evolve from utility to identity. In a place where the right pair of shoes can say more than a full outfit, we’ve entered an era where craftsmanship and authenticity matter more than hype. Walk through SoHo, the LES, or even a late-night industry event in Midtown, and you’ll see it: people are gravitating toward pieces that feel personal, elevated, and built to last. That’s why Steven Victor stepping into footwear feels so natural. Known for shaping some of the most influential sounds and careers in music, he’s always operated with intention, nothing loud, nothing forced, everything rooted in quality. His debut public boot with Timberland carries that same energy. From the moment you pick it up, the difference is clear. Steven went with an ultra-soft leather that gives the boot a distinct feel. His take on the Timberland 6-inch boot is luxury without the stiffness. Quiet confidence in shoe form. For me, the classic wheat Timb is one of the first shoes I ever understood as “culture.” It’s been on construction sites, in subway stations, in music videos and in moments that shaped hip-hop history. It’s woven into the fabric of the city…",

The agreement also prohibits device manufacturers from adding extra warning screens or barriers to block these store installations, prohibits Epic from bringing its Game Store to the Play Store, and ends the mudslinging between Epic and Google. Last week, Epic and Google proposed a settlement that would end their legal dispute over Android app distribution. As part of the settlement, Google committed to making major changes to the Android OS , the Play Store, and its communications and licensing agreements with developers and OEMs. One of the most significant changes involves introducing support for “Registered App Stores” in Android 17 . A “Registered App Store” is a third-party app store that Google has certified as a legitimate platform for downloading Android apps .

Released today (Nov. 14), sophomore solo set Evolution of Romance, Volume One (on Parker&#8217;s Paramount Collective Ventures label via ONErpm) is a melodious, insightful, sensual and frank 34-minute discourse on a topic that never loses its allure. “I want this project to be a conversation between men and women about affection, courtship, support, love; all the things that true romance encompasses,” Parker — the self-proclaimed “Romance Dealer” — declared ahead of the album’s release.

    "body": "TL;DR ChatGPT has dominated the AI market since it launched nearly three years ago, but competitors are beginning to catch up. Data reveals Gemini more than doubled its traffic share over the past year as ChatGPT’s market hold started to chip away. ChatGPT still represents over 70% of generative AI web traffic, although Gemini holds over 10% for the first time. OpenAI kicked off the AI race in late 2022 with the emergence of ChatGPT, the first mainstream chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs). Nearly three years later, the artificial intelligence landscape is ripe with competition. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, Anthropic, and xAI are vying for users and market share as they challenge ChatGPT. Data shared by Similarweb on X this week revealed Google is steadily building momentum and stealing web traffic from OpenAI. As the chart below reveals, ChatGPT had a staggering 86.6% of generative AI traffic share one year ago. Traffic share is a metric used to compare website activity to industry peers. It’s a proportion that represents the percentage of visitors a grouping of competing sites each receive in a particular market. In this case, this chart looks …",

OpenAI is searching for ways to turn its AI technology into consumer products that can compete with the likes of Meta and Google. It recently brought the Sora app, which offers a TikTok-like social feed for AI-generated videos, to the Google Play Store. Now, OpenAI is piloting group chats in ChatGPT. The feature will make it possible for users to chat with their friends and family while also tapping into ChatGPT for help. Rather than a standalone direct messaging system, group chats in ChatGPT are a way to collaborate with others within an AI chat. Users can start a new conversation with ChatGPT or open an existing one to begin.

However, this has been a problem of its own making as it decided to cut loyalty discounts, raise fees, and remove perks .

The cause for the malfunction isn’t clear. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Something’s up with YouTube search on desktop. This morning, many users — including us here at Android Authority — have noticed that YouTube’s search filtering options aren’t functioning. This was brought to our attention by a post on the YouTube subreddit by user Kotif92 . YouTube’s search filters, accessible via the Filters link in the top right corner of desktop search results, all show up “grayed out” — the only filter that’s still accessible is the option to sort search results by relevance (which is the default search behavior).",

Much like they can on iOS, users can choose to share their photo, phone number, and email, or opt only to receive the other person’s details in the Android version of the feature. Android and iOS have long reached points of maturity, and it’s no secret that both Google and Apple look at each other’s operating systems for “inspiration” on what to add to their own. We’ve seen iOS copy features like widgets, free app icon placement on the home screen, and more from Android. On the other hand, we spotted Google working on a Contact Posters-like feature for Android , which the company eventually rolled out as Calling Cards . We’ve now spotted Google working on bringing iOS’ NameDrop-like functionality to Android, and here’s what the experience could look like.

    "body": "TL;DR Google Play System updates deliver crucial features to Android devices, but uninstalling problematic ones has been tricky. Google has offered a rollback tool, but that requires connecting to a computer over the Android Debug Bridge. Right now, Google is rolling out an on-device uninstall option through “Mainline services.” When something goes wrong on our Android devices, one of the first things we think about is “what recently changed, and how can I undo it?” If that’s an app we installed, we can usually remove it without too much trouble.

We have verified these claims, with intermittent charging, random stops, and extremely slow speeds. I also tested a bunch of 7.5W, 10W, 15W, and newer Qi and Qi2 chargers with the Pixel 9 and 10 series to find out which ones are the most problematic. With the Google Pixel 10 series , Google went all in on Qi2 wireless charging , embedding a MagSafe-like Pixelsnap magnetic connection. All Pixel 10 phones support Qi2 at 15W, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL takes it one step further with support for Qi2 25W wireless charging. This upgrade sounds great on paper, but it has left users of older Qi chargers scratching their heads in confusion and frustration, and I’m one of them. As it turns out, Pixel 10 users have been complaining that their phones are not charging properly with chargers that aren’t Qi2 or Qi2 25W-certified. When used with a Pixel 10 series phone, existing Qi 1.x chargers appear to top out at 5W, often really pulling nothing more than 3W, which is significantly slower than those chargers’ advertised 10W…",

Spotify is rolling out a new Recaps feature, and it’s one a lot of us could’ve used ages ago. If you’ve ever returned to an audiobook after a chaotic week and realized you remember exactly two characters and zero plot threads, Recaps is here to save you from your own memory gaps. The tool, currently in beta on iOS, uses AI to generate a short audio summary of whatever you’ve already listened to. After 15 to 20 minutes of playtime, a Recap button appears at the top of the audiobook page you’re currently engaging with. Tap it and Spotify will deliver a tight, spoiler-free rundown of past events, jogging your memory without ruining anything yet to come. The idea is that you’re able to dive back in without rewinding.",

With all the advanced features added to our phones, basic ones, such as making calls or sending texts, may seem neglected. Thankfully, they aren’t entirely overlooked, especially as brands like Google introduce new features that help us make or screen calls more efficiently . One such feature is Google’s Take a Message in the Phone app , which automatically generates a text transcript of your voicemails. The feature is available on Pixel 4 and newer devices in the US, the UK, Australia, and Ireland.

Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR • Samsung originally planned a slimmer Galaxy S26 with a larger battery but reversed course due to Apple’s decision to maintain a $799 price tag for the iPhone 17. Samsung’s revised plan appears to retain the previous dimensions of the S26, with a smaller increase in battery capacity, while focusing on maintaining competitive pricing. Samsung will differentiate Galaxy S models by intent, offering a price-focused base model, a balanced Plus version, and a feature-rich Ultra model. The Galaxy S26 series has been in the news a whole lot before its launch, primarily for all the plan changes that Samsung is making at a relatively late stage of product development. The company reportedly killed the Galaxy S26 Edge and revived the Galaxy S26 Plus, but it has also been making a few other tweaks to the lineup. A new report now sheds light on the reason behind some of these changes, and the answer is surprisingly simple: Apple. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This year, Samsung released its first ultra-thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. The tech giant originally planned to follow it up with a sequel, but ultimately ended up canceling the Galaxy S26 Edge due to poor sales. As it turns out, the compromises required to shrink the phone down were not worth the squeeze. Although Samsung is no longer working on the S26 Edge, it did get far enough in the development process to create dummy units that we’re now seeing for the first time.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new Contacts Picker tool for Android 17 to fix the current all-or-nothing contacts permission. This tool will allow you to share specific contacts with an app, rather than your entire contacts list. Access will be a one-time snapshot, and apps can request only the specific data fields they need. Your device’s contacts list holds a treasure trove of sensitive data that many apps want to get their hands on. Fortunately, Android’s permissions system prevents apps from accessing your contacts without your knowledge. Unfortunately, it’s an all-or-nothing system: You either grant an app access to all your contacts or none of them. This is highly problematic because it forces you to grant many apps full access to your contacts even if they don’t need it. Next year’s Android 17 update could tackle this problem by introducing a system Contacts Picker tool that allows you to select specific contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to your entire contacts list.

We wanted to determine the actual extent of the issue among our readers. We reported on the buggy feature last week , outlining what appeared to be happening and the possible reasons behind it. Pixel 9 owners first raised the alarm back in May, and Pixel 10 owners have since joined them. The behaviour often looks the same — you tap the speakerphone toggle and nothing happens, or it takes a beat or two before it lights up. Some users have found workarounds for the issue, but these shouldn’t be necessary, and Google’s response to one reader didn’t do anything to alleviate concerns.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify has updated its default shuffle to a new “Fewer repeats” algorithm that avoids playing recently heard songs. Premium users can stick with this new mode or switch back to the completely random shuffle algorithm. The change doesn’t impact Smart Shuffle functionality. Spotify shuffle complaints have been ongoing for some time , and the company is finally making a significant change to how it works. Realizing that users might actually want something that falls between playing every track in order and hearing the same song three times in half an hour, the default shuffle mode is being updated to avoid short-term repeats. That means you’ll be less likely to hear the same tracks popping up again and again. According to Spotify’s newsroom announcement , this new behaviour — called Fewer repeats — is now the default for all accounts. It takes your recent listening into account and tries to keep things feeling “fresh,” rather than relying on the old, fully random shuffle logic. We spotted signs of this change coming back in September during an APK teardown of the app , where the strings for both shuffle algorithms first appeared.",

Early builds of ARMSX2 have been available to sideload for a few weeks, but now the app is officially available on the Google Play Store with a new update that makes it better than ever. ARMSX2, like other PS2 emulators such as AetherSX2 , is based on the most popular PS2 emulator on PC, PCSX2. However, development on AetherSX2 ceased years ago, so it’s based on an outdated version of the PC emulator, which was in a relatively rough state. ARMSX2 seeks to remedy that by creating a brand new app that leverages the latest and greatest version of its PC counterpart.",

The company told Android Authority that the phone maintains “excellent health” after 1,400 charging cycles. This comes after the OnePlus 13 offered 1,000 charging cycles before effectively losing 20% of its capacity. The OnePlus 15 has just been launched in global markets, and it has a gigantic battery for a flagship Android phone . The company also claims that this battery will maintain 80% of its effective capacity after four years, but what does this actually mean? OnePlus’s aforementioned battery health claim is a departure from the rest of the industry, which typically measures battery degradation in charging cycles . So how many charging cycles can the OnePlus 15 endure before it reaches 80% of its effective capacity?",
