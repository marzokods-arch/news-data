Born from the pain and uncertainty of a loved one’s illness, as the artist recounted in a recent interview with&nbsp; Billboard , the album showcases a more mature and determined musician with renewed artistic freedom. Here, Alborán takes on the songwriting of all the songs and, for the first time, produces and arranges most of them, experimenting with rhythms like country/folk (“Vámonos de Aquí,” with Indiara Sfair), salsa music (“La Vida Que Nos Espera”) and merengue (“Si Te Quedas”).

So why the two-plus-year gap between Alternative Airplay reigns? While not initially a promoted single, “So Far So Fake” was serviced to radio this summer after it went viral on shortform video platforms such as TikTok, spurred by a dance challenge set mostly to its instrumental break. Boosted by that buzz, “So Far So Fake” debuted on the multimetric Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart in August, eventually rising to No. 8 later that month. It also became the band’s first Billboard Hot 100 entry, reaching No. 64. In between “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake,” Pierce the Veil made Alternative Airplay once via its No. 27-peaking cover of Radiohead ’s “Karma Police” in June 2024.
