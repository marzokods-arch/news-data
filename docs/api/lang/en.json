A new string we discovered in the 2511 Android Canary build reveals a setting to link the mode across connected devices. When enabled, toggling Airplane Mode on your phone will automatically trigger it on your watch via Bluetooth. Most mobile devices feature a one-tap Airplane Mode that disables wireless radios. While designed to prevent interference with aircraft communications, many people also use the feature on the ground to preserve battery life. Although enabling Airplane Mode is simple, Android phones and Wear OS watches don’t currently sync this state. You must remember to toggle it on both devices individually. If you forget one, your device may needlessly drain its battery searching for a cellular signal at 30,000 feet. To solve this, Google is working on a new setting that syncs Airplane Mode between your devices.",

The festival will take place at Lamar Tree Garden on Sep. 3-6 and feature a fourth ‘secret headliner’ to join the previously-announced trio. First held in 2006, the boutique festival has become one of the U.K.’s most well-regarded events and traditionally brings to a close a summer of festivals in the market. 2025’s edition was headlined by Father John Misty, Sharon Van Etten &amp; the Attachment Theory, Caribou and Self Esteem. Pulp will headline their only UK festival show of 2026 at the event and follows a stellar comeback period for the beloved Sheffield band. In June, the group released More , their first LP in 25 years which earned a Mercury Prize nomination and a No. 1 spot on the U.K.’s Official Albums Chart. The group will also play a standalone headline show at Manchester’s Wythenshawe Park on Aug. 28 next year.

The 200MP primary camera is expected to have a 35mm focal length, allowing crisp portraits. The remaining two cameras are unlikely to change over the previous generation. If there’s anything Apple and Samsung agree on, it’s that camera hardware doesn’t need to be upgraded every year — or, more like, every four years. I bet Google would join the club, too. On the other hand, Chinese brands have been persistent in pushing past existing boundaries and making seemingly unimaginable changes to existing phone cameras. Last month, we witnessed the camera battleground heat up again with detachable telephoto lenses shipping with the latest OPPO and vivo flagships. And now, the latter is set for another major upgrade ahead of its upcoming top-of-the-line camera monster. vivo’s upcoming X300 Ultra is slated to be the world’s first phone with dual 200MP cameras . That includes a 200MP primary unit and a 200MP periscopic telephoto. Now, the leaker Digital Chat Station has shared additional information about the dual 200MP setup.",

In addition to the Galaxy Watch 8 series and the new Watch Ultra, which launched with One UI 8 Watch and is based on the latest Wear OS 6, Samsung has already updated last year’s Watch 7 and the Watch Ultra (32GB) to the newest firmware.

Google has already introduced this functionality on iOS, and the Android version is expected to follow suit. We were able to tweak our way into enabling it, bringing you a preview of how it might function. When Apple released iOS 17 about two years ago, it added a feature that instantly garnered a lot of attention. The feature allowed iPhone users to tap and hold on any image to select the subject and convert it into a sticker that can be used across different messaging apps or used as a separate background-free image. It became an instant hit, which prompted Android manufacturers, including Samsung , Xiaomi, and OnePlus, to follow suit and bring it to their respective photo gallery apps. Besides these brands, Google also implemented a similar functionality in Photos to make it more widely accessible, but limited it to iOS users at the time of its launch earlier this year. On the sidelines, however, it has been testing the functionality for Android users and is now making progress toward making it a reality.",

    "body": "TL;DR Early Black Friday deals start November 20 for reMarkable tablets. Shoppers can save $70 on reMarkable 2 bundles and $50 on Paper Pro bundles, including refurbished units. All bundles include a tablet, stylus, and folio. ReMarkable is getting a head start on the holiday season with an early Black Friday campaign. The rare, price-cutting deals begin on November 20, 2025, and run through Cyber Monday, offering meaningful discounts across the company’s lineup and giving shoppers ample time to secure a digital notebook before the holiday rush. This year’s promotion includes two separate deals. The first is a $70 discount on all reMarkable 2 bundles, the brand’s crowd-pleasing classic. The reMarkable 2 stays popular because it’s slim, simple, and nails the paper-and-pen-like experience better than many e-ink competitors. The second deal is a $50 discount on all reMarkable Paper Pro bundles, giving the larger, more powerful model a friendlier price tag. In both cases, the discounts apply whether you’re buying new or refurbished.",

The X-59, designed to fly at supersonic speeds and reduce the sound of loud sonic booms to quieter sonic thumps, took off at 11:14 a.m. EDT and flew for 67 minutes. The flight represents a major step toward quiet supersonic flight over land. “Once again, NASA and America are leading the way for the future of flight,” said acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. “The X-59 is the first of its kind, and a major breakthrough in America’s push toward commercial air travel that’s both quiet and faster than ever before. Thanks to the X-59 team’s innovation and hard work, we’re revolutionizing air travel. This machine is a prime example of the kind of ingenuity and dedication America produces.” Following a short taxi from contractor Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility, NASA X-59 test pilot Nils Larson approached U.S. Air Force Plant 42’s runway in Palmdale, California, where…",

The official announcement is yet to come, which should provide clarity on which models will gain access to the Android 16-based update first. Nothing OS 4.0 includes new features that leverage AI and other content, like the controversial Lock Glimpse feature. Android 16 publicly debuted in June, but Nothing users have been patiently waiting for their version of the latest release for months. Nothing is laser-focused on making AI features a core part of its operating system, whether it be an Android derivative or a future fully-custom OS . After the long wait, Nothing announced the Nothing OS 4.0 open beta in late October, which allowed users to finally test the Android 16-based update. Now, the company is confirming exactly when Nothing phone owners will get public access to Nothing OS 4.0.

The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

Android 16 is publicly available as part of the Android Open Source Project, but it’s barebones, and brands like Google and Samsung put their own twists and styling atop it — that’s how we end up with Pixel UI, One UI, OxygenOS, and other variants. The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 . Meanwhile, Google doubled down on Material You, releasing Material 3 Expressive as part of Android 16 for Pixel phones, tablets, and watches. One is minimalist, the other maximalist. One has a muted color palette while the other’s is bold and vibrant.",

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo.

Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",
