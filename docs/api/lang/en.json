Earlier this year we rang up a list of 10 essential boomer shooters that every FPS fan should play , and if you're a little behind on that particular homework you'll be thrilled to know that all but one of them—Quake, which feels a little ironic, somehow—is currently on sale. That includes: Amid Evil - $6/£5/€6 (70% off) Dusk - $6.79/£5.69/€6.62 (66% off) Selaco - $18.74/£15.74/€18.37 (25% off) HROT - $10/£8.37/€9.75 (50% off) Graven - $5/£4.19/€5 (80% off) Wrath: Aeon of Ruin - $5/£4.19/€5 (80% off, I'm playing this one myself right now and it's quite good) Ion Fury - $10/£8.39/€10 (60% off) Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - $11/£9.49/€11 (50% off) Blood Fresh Supply - $2/£1.43/€1.63 (80% off) That'll keep you busy for a while, but yes, there is more.

Palworld is collaborating with Ultrakill, a brilliant indie shooter by Arsi 'Hakita' Patala that's still in early access itself, and continuing to blow minds (the game sits at \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam with roughly 120K user reviews). Ultrakill is fast-paced, bloody, and constructed around five weapons and the intricate way their various fire modes can be comboed together. It also boasts the brilliant tagline: \"Mankind is dead. Blood is fuel. Hell is full.\" The announcement says that \"collaboration gear and weapons from the cult-hit game Ultrakill are coming to Palworld!\" Ultrakill's hardware is fantastic, and you'd expect there'll be some clever ways to get all your pals tooled-up and combo-ing merrily together. Palworld's most recent high-profile crossover was with Terraria , which caused a big spike in players, so expect something si…",

Today, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms dropped a new trailer revealing the \"Rogue Angel\" game mode, and it teases just enough to make me think, well, maybe not, too. Rogue Angel is a co-op roguelike mode that sets teams of players off to battle demons in \"a twisted new realm of Purgatory, where procedurally generated arenas, unpredictable drops, and brutal enemies await. Each death offers a lesson. Every run improves your skills. Every step brings you closer to becoming unstoppable.\" I felt things start to go sideways almost immediately, when someone in the trailer declared, \"Let's go—on me!\" as if she was calling the shots in some unnamed modern military shooter and not a descent into the warped bowels of Hell. Subsequent dialog does not elevate the situation: Barks like \"hold your ground,\" \"just warming up,\" and \"that is one ugly creature\" are generic and flat in equal measure, but equally awkward—for me, an old-time Painkiller enjoyer, at least—is the sense that they really don't belong here at all.

The aptly named Warhammer RPG Starter Bundle offers a robust start for four of publisher Cubicle 7's games, only missing out The Old World (understandable—it only just came out). That includes: Age of Sigmar: Soulbound (Image credit: Cubicle Seven) A fantastic game for Warhammer's most underrated setting. Soulbound is set up for serious power fantasy—parties are far stronger and more influential than your average gang of D&D adventurers, allowing you to throw giants, dragons, and greater daemons at them while they fight for the fate of entire realms.

Unfortunately, it was rife with bugs at launch, and probably didn't get the fair shake it deserved thanks to its status as an Epic exclusive. It would take another year for it to come to Steam. Gollop remembers it as a \"very difficult project\". \"We reached a really great big audience with that one,\" he tells us. \"It was a very difficult project to do. With crowdfunding, you make promises which you don't know if you're going to be able to deliver. And we obviously tried very hard. We had all these backer builds that came out once every two or three months. Progress towards the final game was getting slower, though, and the game is complex.

It makes sense, therefore, to take a look at where we've come from and how the classic legacy of this keyboard lives on decades later. The Model M started out as a replacement for IBM's Model F keyboard that was previously bundled with its terminals. That became too expensive to produce, so IBM looked to replace it with a \"low cost, high volume\" alternative: the Model M. The first Model M (or then, the IBM Enhanced Keyboard) was the keyboard IBM threw in with its 3161 model terminal and, outside of the typewriter and industrial models, is the genesis for the keyboard in the mainstream with the features that have become ubiquitous elsewhere, most notably key placement for things like the Control and 'inverted T' arrow keys .

I suppose a lot of that's down to the hunger for something new—Blitz Royale found similar success when it first landed a couple weeks ago—though, for some, the reasons for playing are perhaps more sinister. That's because the entire basis of Delulu is dropping in solo and making use of proximity voice chat to team up with other players—and then potentially betraying them.

    "body": "All things come to an end, though when it's related to tech, it often seems like the end comes quicker than the lifespan of a hamster. That might feel like it's the case with a move by Intel to end routine driver updates for all its graphics chips, bar its recent Alchemist and latest Battlemage GPUs. As explained in a knowledge base post , Intel has split its GPU drivers into two distinct packages: those for Alchemist and Battlemage-powered GPUs and a set for everything else from the past five years. In the case of the latter, that means the integrated GPUs in every 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Gen Core processors, as well as anything with an Iris Xe GPU. These will no longer receive game-specific updates, including 'day 0 support' (where a new game gets extra tweaks in the drivers to make it run properly at launch), and instead will just enjoy quarterly driver updates containing security or critical fixes. Unless it's super-critical, of course, in which case, updates will appear as needed. Given that gaming laptops are still being released in 2025 with 14th Gen Core CPUs, this might seem like a bit of a daft move by Intel. However, the gaming performance of the tiny iGPUs in all it…",

If you've been one of the unlucky folk begging all your mates for an invite code to no avail, don't fret: the tag fighter is throwing open the gate to all players much sooner than I expected. Riot just revealed that 2XKO will officially enter early access on October 7. No more closed beta, no more invite codes. The bad news is that it's still a PC-only deal—despite our PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S pals being included back in the 2024 beta, they're still being left out of the main event for now. There's no word on when the game'll go multi-platform just yet, unfortunately. (Image credit: Riot Games) But for those of us on PC, early access marks the start of 'Season 0' as well as the debut of 2XKO's 10th champion, which Riot is still keeping firmly under wraps. Well, it's trying anyway. A datamine of the game's upcoming battle pass included a graphic of Braum, Yasuo, and Darius sporting new costumes alongside a picture of rat mascot Teemo. The latter of whom isn't exactly in the game yet. The official 2XKO X account responded to the…",

It looks like each phase will last a week, and thanks to Blizzard we now know what's going to be contained within them. Thankfully, arguably the biggest part of the expansion, the thing that's got most players all frothy with excitement, is going to be available right from the get-go. That is, of course, housing. That's coming in the first phase on October 2, along with the Eversong Woods zone; the level-up and Arator campaigns; the Windrunner Spire and Murder Row dungeons; the Collegiate Calamity, Parhelion Plaza and The Darkway delves; delve companion Valeera Sanguinar; the Devourer Demon Hunter specialisation and class updates; and professions. Phase one looks like it's going to be the meatiest individual phase, but the fifth phase will contain everything from the first four weeks, on top of all the level 90 goodies, including the start of the level 90 campaign, news delves, loads of level 90 acti…",

Borderlands 3 players might recognise that name, as the Super Soldier is actually one of the many returning legendaries from the previous game, alongside the likes of the Hellwalker and Kaoson . While these other callbacks have seen quite a bit of shakeup, the Super Soldier remains largely the same, and that's far from a bad thing.

The Frame 4500X isn't about modesty. No fishtank case really is. You can't hide anything with a window quite this large onto your PC's components. It's a great way to showcase your build, however, and the Frame 4500X wears it well. I've shown a few people this case since building a PC into it for testing, and it quite literally has the wow factor (both people said 'wow' out loud—very satisfying). There's also a flowing design to the vents, sweeping from the rear of the top panel and down to the front of the side panel. This helps let the case and cooling solution breathe, but, very importantly, helps keep the non-windowed side of the case exciting and more of a match for the windowed side.

That's according to China Times (via Dan Nystedt on X ), which claims that industry sources have told them that the price for TSMC's N2 process node will be more than 50% higher than N3. It notes that the Taiwanese firm's current best node, N3P, is around 20% higher than the previous generation N5. Price increases in semiconductor wafer manufacturing are inevitable, especially when it concerns the very best process nodes. That's because all of the equipment used to make the wafers has to be better than the apparatus used for earlier nodes.

Best gifts for Cogimyun in Hello Kitty Island Adventure Similarly to every other character, you can only give Cogimyun three gifts per day, unless you use a Friendship Blossom to reset her daily gift allowance. When you start out in Wheatflour Wonderland, there are a few items you can pick up around the map to boost Cogimyun's friendship, such as Noodle Grass and any critter. These are great starting points, but it's best to not rely on them for too long. The following …",

I was fully ready for Little Nightmares 3 to be the first I actually played on my own, until the demo released and I realised it had co-op—foiled again. Little Nightmares 3 is the first of the series to feature co-op, and after just 30 minutes of crawling through Necropolis, I've come to the stark realisation that the entire series, or at least the sections where there's already an NPC companion by your side, would've greatly benefited from supporting two players. You still have the option to play with an AI companion if you'd rather go alone.

See, throwing knives can have the \"Penetrator Augment\" rolled on them, which causes all damage to be critical damage for a few seconds. Vex, in particular, can combine this with her Contamination skill, with critical hits causing 100% status chance, stacked on top of her crits already being able to cause bleeds. You bleed someone, the bleed is now critically hitting, causing more bleeds, which themselves cause more bleeds, which then—you get the idea. With such an overpowered build on the table, you might think Gearbox would be winding up to take a swing for the kneecaps with the nerf bat, but you'd be wrong. Per creative director Graeme Timmins on X , the studio will be going buffs first, nerfs later: \"We've seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife,\" Timmins writes. \"We're not going to act on those immediately, instead, we're looking at our first round of buffs.

According to Kojima speaking at the event, casting of the main character was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, but he did reveal three confirmed cast members. These include Don Lee (or Ma Dong-Seok) who has appeared in Eternals and Train to Busan. Charlee Fraser, best known for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, will also star alongside Minami Hamabe, who appeared in Godzilla Minus One. Here's the poster: (Image credit: Kojima Productions) Physint will use an advanced version of the Decima Engine that powers Death Stranding, as well as Horizon Zero Dawn and others. It's further out than even OD, which itself doesn't have a release date, though Physint is expected to release within six years. \"[Physint] will be both a game and a movie at the same time,\" Kojima said in February 2024. \"Of course it will be a game.

Look: I won't profess to know what's going on in the above trailer. There's definitely a whole lot more punching than I remember in Death Stranding. The big scary black-tentacled dog looks pretty gnarly. The animation is definitely of the premium variety: it looks gorgeous in action, and seems more impeccably detailed than the usual cross-media anime cash-in. Mosquito doesn't have a release window, and again, the title hasn't been confirmed yet.

Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Hideo Kojima on stage to present the video, which shows in-engine footage from Unreal Engine 5. The footage shows what could be the protagonist, played by Sophia Lillis, entering a morbid-looking room, and approaching a maudlin little table with an elaborate candle display. As they start to light the candles, weird, scary stuff starts to happen. Kojima reiterated how the game will blur games and film, without going into any specifics on exactly how. Spencer's comments were similarly unhelpful: he said that OD was innovating \"in gameplay, story and player engagement\". Microsoft is offering technical support on the project. It certainly looks a lot like P.T. The sound design is deliciously oppressive, and the footage is mostly first-person.

Throw away the E-Liquid, though, we won't be needing it to slay imps, demons, and lost souls. Hacker and creator Aaron Christophel recently took to their YouTube channel to show Doom on a Pixo Aspire, which is \"a way overpowered vape, for whatever reason\" ( via VideoCardz ). It has a 32-bit Arm Cortex M4 processor, 384 kB of flash memory and up to 64 kB of SRAM. Christophel notes that it would need \"that last bit of RAM\" to run Doom natively, so this version is effectively sending game output to a bit of software, which flips the screen to run on the vape. In other words, a PC runs Doom but displays it on the vape's touchscreen via a USB Type-C cable. Christophel says you can \"use it as a second monitor\", which makes sense, should you have to show a mouse or some sort of small pet a duplicate of your screen. Hey, it's nice to have the option. If you have such a mouse, you can grab custom firmware via GitHub , run it on the vape, then mirror your screen. Impressively, this little vape has a Bluetooth LE chip and a microphone, too.

While it retains its unique bullet-hose, explosive personality, the Kaoson looks a little different than you might remember. Since Dahl weapons no longer exist, the Kaosin is now a Vladof SMG with a completely different design. The Hot Slugger or the Hellwalker might be more practical for mobbing, but it's hard to beat the raw stacking damage potential of the Kaoson against bosses. If you want to add it to your collection (and you should), here's what you need to do. How to get the Kaoson in Borderlands 4 Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: Gearbox) You can farm the Kaoson from Primordial Guardian Origo, the final boss of the Terminus Range vault . To access the Arch of Origo vault, you need to find all three vault key fragments in Terminus Range. Once inside, fight through three waves of enemies until you reach Origo. Like all bosses, you can use the nearby Moxxi's Big Encore machine to repeatedly farm Origo in hopes of getting a lucky Kaoson drop. Primordi…",
