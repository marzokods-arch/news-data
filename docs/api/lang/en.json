HUAWEI was in first place, while Motorola was the runner-up. This report doesn’t take Samsung’s latest foldables into account, as they launched in Q3. Foldable phones only account for a small number of smartphones shipping globally, but a new market share report has revealed some bad news for Samsung for Q2 2025. Counterpoint Research has published its foldable phone market share report for Q2 2025, and it turns out HUAWEI was on top with a 45% share. This is a significant boost from a year ago, when it held 32% of the market. The tracking firm attributed these results to the Chinese market, saying it accounts for the majority of foldable phone shipments globally. Furthermore, foldable shipments in general saw a 45% year-on-year increase.",

Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Listen, foldables are cool — who doesn’t love big things that transform into smaller things — but they’re also becoming a little been-there-done-that as manufacturers really start getting comfortable with the form factor. And that sort of familiarity is probably exactly why so many of us have been shifting our interests slightly towards the growing crop of “tri-fold” devices like Samsung’s upcoming TriFold or the new Mate XTs .

But these robots have evolved exponentially since, with current generation robot mowers able to navigate using virtual boundaries and handle different types of terrain. No robot lawn mower was perfect, though, with navigation and terrain struggles remaining significant pain points.

The feature has been in preview testing for some lucky US users with specific voices for months now, but Google just announced the exact date when it’ll start showing up for real : October 1. Although this will still be an early access, I can’t wait to get my proverbial hands on it because I’m sick of Google Assistant’s glitches . The inconsistency, frequent bugs, and silly downgrades have taken the joy out of using a “smart” speaker, to a point where I find myself arguing with it more often than using it. Gemini, however, has been a lot more interesting to use on my Pixel phones and watches, and I can’t help but think that this will be a huge upgrade for everyone. Here’s why.",

Swag II was now officially with us. The 23-track set follows in the organic-sounding, warm-feeling alt-R&amp;B mode of the first Swag , with many of the same sonic architects (Dijon, Carter Lang, Mk.gee), and even a couple overlapping feature guests in Lil B and Eddie Benjamin. New to the Swag is Afrobeats star Tems, British singer-songwriter Bakar and &#8217;00s Louisiana rapper Hurricane Chris. But no skits this time — Druski makes nary an appearance across the set, although &#8220;I&#8217;m not the one&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s not clocking to you&#8221; references are both made in the album&#8217;s lyrics.

This bug is technically different, but the end result is the same. Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency.

It is available for Kickstarter pre-sale now for €279.99, with shipping expected in November 2025.

At IFA 2025, DuRoBo debuted a more ambitious device, the Krono, pitched as an “AI-powered ePaper Focus Hub.” This is either a mouthful of marketing or a peek at where these types of devices are indeed headed. On paper (pun intended), the specs look solid. The Krono features a 6.13-inch Carta 1200 HD display at 300ppi with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo. Powering those beefier internals is a 3,950mAh battery, though DuRoBo hasn’t shared an actual usage estimate.",

The images come from tech reviewer Sonny Dickson on X , who shared alleged dummies of the Galaxy S26 Pro, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra. This year’s lineup is expected to mark a naming shift for Samsung, with the standard model reportedly being renamed “Pro” and the old Plus slot now taken by the second-gen Edge.

But this evolution comes with a new concern: over-saturation. There are now well over a dozen reputable prepaid carriers, along with a seemingly endless wave of smaller providers. In 2025 alone, at least five new mobile services have either been announced or even launched already, including Klarna Mobile , SmartLess Mobile, Trump Mobile , Gerald BNPL Mobile, and an upcoming service from MrBeast .

Now, the company has announced full-fledged Auracast support for recent Pixel phones . Auracast is part of the Bluetooth LE Audio standard, and this feature allows you to broadcast Bluetooth audio or tune into Bluetooth audio broadcasts from others. This means you don’t have to give one earbud to a friend if you want to listen to music together, as you can broadcast the audio to multiple pairs of earbuds and headphones. This is also useful for situations like sightseeing, as the guide or establishment can broadcast audio to your existing Bluetooth earphones.

Now, Google is back with a new app that leverages the power of AI to let you create a fully custom Android Bot that reflects your unique look. This new app is a revival of a much-loved classic: Androidify.
