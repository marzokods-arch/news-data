Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air. TIG welding doesn’t leave behind splatter or residue, giving a clean, precise weld. Metal Inert Gas (MIG) Welding: Whi…",

Just weeks later, a different officer shot and killed another Minnesotan, Alex Pretti; in both instances, the president and other federal government leaders maintained that the officers were acting in self-defense, but video footage captured by eyewitnesses has many Americans convinced otherwise. In response, fans have seen the biggest wave yet of famous artists publicly condemning ICE, whether through posts on social media or by wearing &#8220;ICE Out&#8221; buttons on the Grammys red carpet in February.

There’s no clear fix yet, and Google hasn’t yet commented on the issue. Google’s smartphones aren’t renowned for overly buggy behavior, but some Pixel owners are reporting an unsettling audio issue. Users online say their phones sometimes produce a very loud popping sound when opening or closing apps, as if the speakers briefly overload for a split second. The Reddit discussion on r/GooglePixel began with a Pixel 10 owner who said the pops happen randomly and can be alarmingly loud. Others quickly replied with similar experiences on devices including the Pixel 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and various previous-generation handsets, suggesting the issue isn’t limited to a single model. One user noted that it’s especially uncomfortable in quiet environments, calling it “cringe” when it happens in a silent room.",

Including just the right one brightens up a dull text, or even helps convey some emotional subtlety that might have otherwise gone missed. But in order to get the most out of emoji, we need to be able to clearly see them, and it looks like Google’s working on a change in Gboard that could soon help out with just that.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to. The image below shows how these two new plans compare to the standard ones.",

The company says it’s working with partners to expand the functionality across the rest of the Android ecosystem and that we should expect some exciting announcements very soon. Google says this expansion is part of a broader push to make switching from iPhone to Android easier. When Google shocked everyone last year by making Android’s Quick Share interoperable with Apple’s AirDrop , the feature launched out of nowhere and has been limited to the Pixel 10 series ever since. At the time, Google stopped short of saying when it would reach the broader Android ecosystem, but behind the scenes, the signs were already there.

After dominating satellite-based internet and direct-to-cell services with its Starlink venture, SpaceX may expand into making its own smartphones, Reuters reported earlier today.

The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12).

Buying last year’s model is the better choice for multiple reasons. And this doesn’t just apply to high-end phones, but also to the more affordable models from the Pixel A and Samsung Galaxy A lineups. And just to be clear, I’m not talking about buying a used device from a stranger on the internet. I’m talking about buying a brand-new, sealed unit of a phone that was launched about a year ago.

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI.

The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets.

However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes.

Auto dubbing is now generally available to creators, and Expressive Speech debuts with support for eight languages. YouTube has also started its pilot program to test lip sync for translations. YouTube attracts creators from all around the world, and while that means there’s almost always going to be some great new content out there that’s targeted at you, it sucks when the video you most want to watch isn’t available in your language. Google’s been working hard for years to break down those kind of barriers, though, most recently introducing automatic dubbing into multiple languages. This week, we’re learning about what sounds like the program’s biggest and most impactful expansion since its creation. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Unlike Developer Previews, which were limited to early release cycles, the Canary channel offers a rolling, year-round stream of updates. Enthusiasts looking for the latest features should flash the Canary builds or wait for the Android 17 Beta launching in the coming months. Google launched the Android Canary program for Pixel enthusiasts last year, giving them a chance to try bleeding-edge Android releases before they reach the Beta program. The news was well received by users who don’t mind trading stability for flashy new software features, but some users preferred waiting for Android 17 Developer Previews to roll out. It seems many people missed the memo: there will be no more Android Developer Previews. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The finding follows previous reports that Samsung plans to produce a million units of the Wide Fold, higher than any previous special edition foldable. Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US.

Google built on this advantage by allowing users to attach all sorts of files and media to Gemini to get even better, more personalized answers.

Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you.

Google Labs and Search Labs have long been used by Google as a way to give users early access to features that aren’t quite finished. With Gemini evolving so quickly, it always felt like only a matter of time before it got the same treatment. Right on cue, Gemini Labs has finally made an appearance, after we spotted signs of it approaching behind the scenes in recent months. As 9to5Google spotted, Google has started surfacing a dedicated Labs section inside the Gemini web app, giving experimental features a clearly marked home instead of mixing them in with everything else. The Labs area lives inside Gemini’s Tools menu and is marked with the familiar Google beaker icon.

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears. Navigation still works, but there’s no visual indicator of the car’s actual location. Force-quitting Maps on the phone brings the icon back for the user, but only until the next time i…",

There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data. The “Optimize network for battery life” toggle prioritizes efficiency to help extend battery life. Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

    "body": "Credit: AssembleDebug / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is rumored to launch the Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro alongside the Galaxy S26 later this month. The earbuds are likely to feature a practical, stable design to avoid the Galaxy Buds 3’s quality issues. The Buds 4 series might also cost the same as the Buds 3 did at launch. Unlike its smartphones, Samsung refreshes its flagship earbuds once every two years. That means the successor to the Galaxy Buds 3 series should launch sometime this year. While Samsung typically launches earbuds alongside its foldables at mid-year, it may release the Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro earlier than usual, alongside the Galaxy S26 series later this month. And, the chief focus for these flagship earbuds would be reliability. According to industry sources cited by Korea’s ET News , Samsung’s efforts with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 series aim to regain consumer trust. The Galaxy Buds 3’s launch was marred by widespread reliability issues, including poor build quality, visible gaps in the earbuds, and fragile earbuds that ripped easily ( here are some more specific ones ). These issues forced Samsung to halt sales immediately after the July 2024 release and…",

This will likely compete with more traditional 16:9 handhelds from Retroid, AYN, and AYANEO. ANBERNIC might have had a slower 2025, but the company has come into 2026 swinging with an announcement for two upcoming handhelds. Unlike the company’s recent releases, it loses the retro aspect ratio and targets a far more modern design. The ANBERNIC RG VITA and RG VITA Pro are clearly inspired by Sony’s last true gaming handheld, the PS Vita. They have the same widescreen format, shoulder button cutout, and an all-glass front with connected control bubbles.",

I’m sure you can imagine this has the potential to be a hugely powerful tool. This might even be an early glimpse of the near future of today’s quickly advancing AI tools.

It’s all very messy. Even someone like me, whose job is to follow Android, kept getting confused by all the overlapping update cycles and feature releases.
