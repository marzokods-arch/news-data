    "body": "Pfizer and BioNTech report that their updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for the 2025–2026 season produced strong immune responses, boosting neutralizing antibody levels by at least fourfold in older people and those with underlying medical conditions. The positive results come as Americans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shots under the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition. In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people aged 65 or older and 50 people aged 18 to 64 with an underlying condition. Those conditions included asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking.

    "body": "On Tuesday, Anthropic launched a new file creation feature for its Claude AI assistant that enables users to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents directly within conversations on the web interface and in the Claude desktop app. While the feature may be handy for Claude users, the company's support documentation also warns that it \"may put your data at risk\" and details how the AI assistant can be manipulated to transmit user data to external servers. The feature, awkwardly named \"Upgraded file creation and analysis,\" is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's Code Interpreter and an upgraded version of Anthropic's \"analysis\" tool . It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access \"in the coming weeks,\" according to the announcement. The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. \"This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk,\" Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. \"Monitor…",

Additionally, the launch target has slipped from the year 2026 to 2028. However, the cost increase and schedule slippages are not new. The space agency disclosed these issues nearly a year and a half ago. What is notable about the new report from NASA's inspector general is that the cause of these problems was not a serious technical problem or a flawed design of a vehicle intended to spend years flying across Titan.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42944, makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute commands by submitting malicious payloads to an open port. The maximum-severity threat stems from a deserialization vulnerability. Serialization is a coding process that translates data structures and object states into formats that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Deserialization is the process in reverse. Read full article Comments",

Like the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Air has a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz—something that was reserved for only the Pro iPhones up until this year. The Air's display also has always-on functionality and claims 3,000 nits of peak brightness.

The headliner across all of the updates is Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” UI overhaul, which adds glass-inspired transparency and translucency and bouncy animations throughout all of Apple’s software. Inspired in part by the way that UI elements in visionOS float over top of your real-world surroundings, Liquid Glass is Apple’s most comprehensive UI overhaul since the release of iOS 7 back in 2013.

    "body": "Apple's popular AirPods Pro in-ear headphones are getting a substantial upgrade. The new model, dubbed AirPods Pro 3, greatly improves active noise cancellation (ANC), performs live translations, and tracks your heart rate like a fitness wearable. This will have to be subjected to third-party testing, but Apple made some intriguing claims about AirPods Pro 3's performance during its iPhone and Apple Watch announcement today. Namely, that they'll have twice the ANC performance as AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. Additionally, Apple claims that voices will sound \"more natural\" in Transparency, the mode meant to allow nearby sounds to be heard even while you have the earbuds in. Those who've used earlier iterations of Transparency will likely note that voices can sound a little bit filtered, so that could be a nice-to-have improvement. Read full article Comments",

The DOJ said Pratt \"exploited hundreds of women,\" and that 40 of them spoke at the sentencing hearing. Pratt, 42, faced a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison.

The proposed settlement comes in a case where Anthropic could have owed more than $1 trillion in damages after Alsup certified a class that included up to 7 million claimants whose works were illegally downloaded by the AI company. Instead, critics fear Anthropic will get off cheaply, striking a deal with authors suing that covers less than 500,000 works and paying a small fraction of its total valuation (currently $183 billion ) to get away with the massive theft. Defector noted that the settlement doesn't even require Anthropic to admit wrongdoing, while the company continues raising billions based on models trained on authors' works. Most recently, Anthropic raised $13 billion in a funding round, making back about 10 times the proposed settlement amount after announcing the deal. Read full article Comments",

The controversy started at the Consumer Electronics Show, where Genki showed off to press and attendees a 3D mockup of the then-unseen Switch 2 sporting the company's accessories. Genki also posted a video showing a detailed mockup of the system from various angles. By April, Genki was promoting a \"Genki Direct\" livestream focused on \"upcoming accessories for Genki Glitch 2\" (no, that isn't a typo). Nintendo's lawyers reportedly visited Genki's CES booth once reports of the Switch 2 mockup started going viral. But a Genki representative asserted at the time that the company did not sign an NDA with Nintendo and therefore \"has nothing to worry about.\" Read full article Comments",

The operator of the now-defunct moddedhardware.com ( archived ) now owes Nintendo $2 million after a recent settlement filed in a Washington state District Court. The final judgement, which was jointly agreed to by both parties, asserts that Daly knowingly sold devices such as the MIG Switch and MIG Dumper that \"are primarily designed for the purpose of circumventing the [technological protection measures, and] have limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent the TPMs.\" Daly also sold and installed mod chips to get around Switch DRM and \"copied and distributed certain copyrighted Nintendo games to his customers,\" according to the judgment. Nintendo's lawsuit alleged that the company initially approached Daly about the sale of these devices in March 2024, and that Daly agreed at the time \"both verbally and in signed writing\" to refrain from further sales. After Daly continued to sell the devices, though, Nintendo took the further step of bringing this lawsuit last June. Read …",

The various speculative notions that have been floated, mainly via public relations efforts, include things such as spreading reflective particles over newly formed sea ice to promote its persistence and growth; building giant ocean-bottom sea walls or curtains to deflect warmer streams of water away from ice shelves; pumping water from the base of glaciers to the surface to refreeze it, and even intentionally polluting the upper atmosphere with sulfur-based or other reflective particles to dim sunlight.

    "body": "While tech companies market AI as a productivity tool for everyone, a UK government study reveals an unexpected result: Neurodiverse employees may be benefiting far more from chatbots than their neurotypical colleagues. The UK's Department for Business and Trade recently released evaluation results from its Microsoft 365 Copilot trial showing that while overall satisfaction was 72 percent, neurodiverse employees reported statistically higher satisfaction (at a 90 percent confidence level) and were more likely to recommend the tool (at a 95 percent confidence level) than other respondents. \"It's leveled the playing field,\" one participant with ADHD told researchers during follow-up interviews. One user with dyslexia said that the tool \"empowered\" them to perform tasks with confidence they previously lacked, particularly in report writing. Another dyslexic participant drew direct comparisons to existing accessibility software, noting that Copilot \"does a hell of a lot more\" than traditional assistive technology while being \"embedded in your applications\" rather than requiring separate programs.

The suit, filed in US District Court for the District of Northern California, recites a litany of purported security and privacy flaws that Meta not only didn’t fix after becoming aware of them, but also kept secret, allegedly in violation of a $5 billion settlement then-Whatsapp parent company Facebook reached with the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint was filed by Attaullah Baig, who became head of WhatsApp security in 2021. Read full article Comments",

Google is heading back to court soon in hopes of convincing a judge that it should not have to split up its ad business. The company lost its adtech antitrust case earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: \"The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline.\" Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case declined to order that in the remedies. Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition. The court in this case ruled that in tying its display ad …",
