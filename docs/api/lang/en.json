With Spotify hogging the most significant chunk of the market among all music streaming services and serving more than 275 million paid subscribers monthly, I’m certainly part of the majority here.

The AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini is an entry-level device with a very compact form factor. It looks very much like its older sibling, the Pocket AIR, which launched back in 2023. As the company’s first Android-based device, it helped set the scene for the rest of its lineup, and now the highly sought-after handheld has been scrunched down and reduced in price.",

The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

Audio length can be up to 10 minutes for free users. Around the beginning of August, we found evidence that Google was working on adding a highly requested feature to Gemini. Specifically, the AI app was getting support for audio file uploads . Fast forward to today, and the function is now live on Android, iOS, and on the web. On social media, Josh Woodward , VP of Google Labs and Gemini, announced that users can now upload any file to the Gemini app. According to Woodward, this also includes the number one request — audio files. So when you tap or click on the plus icon and select “Upload files” (web) or “Files” (mobile), you’ll be able to upload MP3 files, WAV files, and more.",

The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

Granted, it’s a Pixel 8, so it lacks the latest and greatest features of the Pixel 10 series, but having access to Android 16 has been a joy. The software is swift, cheerful, and clean, but there’s a reason I opt for the Galaxy S24 FE as my main device. I still miss plenty of software features when using the Pixel over the Galaxy. Modes, Routines, and Good Lock are high on that list, but the stock file manager would be my biggest issue if I switched to the Pixel permanently and were limited to stock apps. This isn’t to say that Files by Google is a bad app; it’s just that Samsung My Files is much better. Here’s why.",

For starters, it makes it easy to hot swap batteries on the go, so you can carry multiple and switch them if your phone dies mid-day. Also, batteries degrade over time, and today’s standard solution is to take them to a professional to replace them. With removable batteries, this process is as simple as ordering a new battery and sticking it into the phone yourself.",

And to drive that point further, Google bundles in a free year of the Gemini AI Pro plan with the phone. The perk is designed to funnel you into recurring payments, and storage is the bait. In fact, I’d go as far as saying that the free year of Gemini Pro and 2TB of cloud storage are a key part of Google’s marketing to make the phone appear like a bargain. Two terabytes of cloud storage, access to Google’s best AI features, including Deep Research with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

This leak comes from the same X (formerly Twitter) user who released last week’s animations, @TechHighest . In this particular video, we see how the Galaxy foldable will open and close.

Otherwise, it offers plenty of AI features, a relatively large battery, and seven years of updates. Colleague Joe Maring recently looked at some alternative phones to the Pixel 10 Pro. He also included a poll asking for your favorite alternative phone. Well, the results are in, and here’s what you told us.",

Nothing has changed for the better with the new Pixel 10 series . In fact, after testing Google’s latest flagships with the company’s new 67W USB-C charger , the situation is in some ways worse than before. I’ll let the graphs do the talking.",

Solid-state construction allows these batteries to take serious damage and keep right on running. Magnetic Qi charging also makes them perfect for pairing with a new Pixel 10. Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

Listen, foldables are cool — who doesn’t love big things that transform into smaller things — but they’re also becoming a little been-there-done-that as manufacturers really start getting comfortable with the form factor. And that sort of familiarity is probably exactly why so many of us have been shifting our interests slightly towards the growing crop of “tri-fold” devices like Samsung’s upcoming TriFold or the new Mate XTs . Editor’s note: When did the mobile industry forget how to count? All these things fold twice , not three times. Get it together.",

But these robots have evolved exponentially since, with current generation robot mowers able to navigate using virtual boundaries and handle different types of terrain. No robot lawn mower was perfect, though, with navigation and terrain struggles remaining significant pain points.
