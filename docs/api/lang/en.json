This marks Carlile’s fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John promoting their joint project Who Believes in Angels? . On Saturday’s show, she took center stage solo, delivering two emotionally charged performances. Opening with “Church &amp; State,” Carlile sang of a “failing empire” and sociopolitical unrest in a haunting arrangement co-written with producer Andrew Watt and longtime collaborators Phil and Tim Hanseroth. She followed with “Human,” a soaring ballad that reflects on vulnerability and resilience — also the name of her upcoming Human Tour, which kicks off in February 2026. The two songs are from Carlile’s eighth studio album, Returning to Myself , released Oct. 25. It marks her first solo LP since 2021’s In These Silent Days , which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, topped the Rock and Americana/Folk charts, and won multiple Grammy awards, including Best Americana Album and awards for “Broken Horses.” It also …",

The singer, fashion entrepreneur and reality TV personality marked the milestone on Friday (Nov. 1) with a reflective Instagram post , sharing how giving up alcohol transformed her life and creativity. “8 years ago today I made the choice to confront, to confess and to let go of the self-sabotaging parts of my life that I was choosing,” Simpson wrote. “Making that decision allowed me to fully live in the pursuit of God’s purpose for my life. Alcohol silenced my intuition, blocked my dreams and chased my circulating fears of complacency.” She continued, “Today I am clear. Today I am driven by faith. Both fear and faith are something that we feel and may not see, I’m so happy I chose faith over fear. It was not in the fight that I found my strength, it was in the surrender.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson) The “With You” singer has been open about her journey to sobriety since revealing in her 2020 memoir Open Book that she quit drinking in 2017.

The psych-pop gem, originally released as Tame Impala’s debut single in 2009, hadn’t appeared on a tour setlist since 2018. The moment came midway through night three of a four-night sold-out run at the arena, with Parker and his touring band all dressed in costumes nodding to Parker’s “scarf-era” aesthetic from the early 2010s. The Halloween chaos didn’t stop there. Comedian and longtime Tame Impala fan Eric Andre made an unexpected cameo—inside the show’s bathroom cam. Parker has famously included a backstage toilet feed on tour to give fans a surreal behind-the-scenes moment mid-set. This time, Andre took over the screen, sharing a quick on-camera kiss w…",
