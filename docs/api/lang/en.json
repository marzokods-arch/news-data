With eight nominations at next month’s ARIA Awards, Ninajirachi (real name: Nina Wilson) is the leader of the pack. Separately, her debut full length album I Love My Computer (via NLV Records) is one of nine titles shortlisted for the coveted 2025 Australian Music Prize , awarded each year to the outstanding Australian album of original work from the previous year, judged by a music industry panel. And in August, the month I Love My Computer dropped, she was named as Billboard&#8217;s dance rookie of the month.

Her bite-sized tracks helped her become one of TikTok&#8217;s earliest favorites, but her witty, honest lyricism and infectious self-produced records that blend drum and bass, garage, and alternative pop helped her transcend the volatile social media app. On Friday night (Oct. 24), just a week after dropping her inventive Fancy Some More remix project, Pinkpantheress delivered the strongest, most fully-realized show of her career at the launch of the North American leg of her An Evening With&#8230; Pinkpantheress Tour.
