The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

We first heard that the Galaxy S26 launch is reportedly set for February 2026 in San Francisco. A subsequent leak disagreed with this timeline, stating that the company had managed to pull itself together and is now gunning for a late January launch .

Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

Beyond its often questionable navigation suggestions, its UI frequently disrupts and distracts in an environment where information should be as legible as possible.

The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

While it’s more affordable than last year’s Cine Play 1, it’s still firmly in premium territory, starting at roughly US $1,670 for the base model or around US $1,950 with the optional stand bundle. The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors. Its RGB laser light source is rated for approximately 25,000 hours, and the projector supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for dynamic range playback.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s Galaxy S26 phones will apparently receive wireless charging speed upgrades for the first time in years. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is tipped to get 25W wireless charging while the S26 and S26 Plus are said to offer 20W speeds. This would be a notable boost over the 15W speeds seen on Samsung flagships for over five years now. Samsung’s flagship Galaxy phones have long topped out at 15W wireless charging speeds. By contrast, it’s not uncommon for the best Android phones from rival brands to offer 30 to 50W wireless speeds. Thankfully, Samsung might actually bring a long-overdue speed upgrade. ET News reports that all Galaxy S26 series models will receive faster wireless charging speeds. The Galaxy S26 Ultra will apparently lead the charge with 25W wireless charging, while the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus are poised to receive 20W speeds.",

The 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display pairs with 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, 4G data, and a physical AI shortcut button. It is available now, priced at $279.99, from Viwoods and third-party retailers like Amazon. Viwoods’ newest AiPaper Reader just became the first E Ink device to ship with Android 16 . While Viwoods isn’t the first brand to blend E Ink with Android, it’s the first to do so on Google’s latest software, a distinction that hints at faster updates and a push to make e-readers feel less isolated from the rest of the Android ecosystem. Specs-wise, the pocket-sized e-reader is built around a 6.13-inch Carta 1300 display at 300ppi, offering faster refresh rates and higher contrast than older panels. With a design that measures 6.7mm thick and just 138g, it looks more like a small phone than a tablet, making it an easy everyday carry for readers who want something portable.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority Mint Mobile is well-known for its extremely affordable, no-frills services that typically require customers to pay for months to a year ahead of time in order to get rates that are hard to beat elsewhere. This was especially true for new customers until fairly recently, as you could previously get a year of unlimited service for just $180 upfront, or what works out to an outstanding $15 a month. Unfortunately, this promo has finally ended, and so the same price will only net new customers a 15GB a month data allotment (currently on sale for $14 per month). While Mint is known for offering recurring deals from time to time, right now, there’s less incentive to jump into an unlimited annual plan with the carrier.",

The latest Edge beta on Android expands the list of supported extensions from nearly 20 previously, now allowing you to install virtually any one of the thousands of supported extensions. The feature is hidden, but you can enable it by following the simple steps listed below. Google Chrome is undisputedly the most widely used web browser on both desktop and mobile devices. But if there’s one feature that makes the mobile version feel incomplete, it’s the lack of extension support. Since it is a highly requested feature, Google is working on bringing extension support to Chrome on Android , although we aren’t yet close to delivering it as a feature. Meanwhile, some other web browsers on Android already allow you to use extensions , and one of them is receiving a significant upgrade in this regard. Since Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium (the framework that powers Chrome), it also supports Chrome extensions. Edge’s Android version has supported extensions for over a year, and the built-in extension store allows you to choose from a selection of 20-so…",

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed.

Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.
