Earlier on Monday night, Ross featured among the Top 6 finalists, each of whom was tasked with performing two songs — one contemporary and one classic. Ross went with ABBA ’s classic “The Winner Takes It All,” and opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour.” Each coach entered the finale with one artist selected from the Playoffs: Ralph Edwards for Snoop Dogg, Aubrey Nicole for Reba McEntire, Ross for Niall Horan, and Jazz McKenzie for Michael Bublé. Two additional finalists — Max Chambers from Team Bublé and DEK of Hearts from Team Niall — earned their spots through viewer votes. When America’s final votes were counted, Horan once again got the rub of the green. The former One Direction star can now boast three consecutive wins as a coach, becoming the first coach in the history of the show to win their first three seasons. The Irishman is just the second coach (after Blake Shelton) to win three in a row. Ross…",

Who did Carpenter write “Manchild” about? Drink. What was the most unhinged thing she’s done to impress a crush? “I don’t think I’ve tried to impress anyone,” Carpenter responded. “That’s such a boring answer.” Yes it is. Meyers then flipped the question. Someone stole an article of clothing from Carpenter&#8217;s house, we learned, to get her attention. Did it work? Sure did.
