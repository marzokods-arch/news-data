If you own a OnePlus Watch or OnePlus earbuds, you might have seen a confusing email recently. It came from HeyTap, the Oppo-linked company that develops and supports the OHealth and HeyMelody apps. The email said US account services are shutting down on September 28. That naturally raised a few eyebrows. These apps handle things like syncing health data to pushing firmware updates, so if HeyTap is walking away from US accounts, what happens to the OnePlus app data next? Some Watch owners on Reddit worried they’d be cut off from their health metrics. Others assumed there would be a plan, and this would have little impact on the apps themselves.",

This build shows tree, grass, and ragweed pollen levels on color-coded leaf icons, linking to Weather.com for details. The same version also refreshes the Weather app’s navigation buttons, borrowing design cues from iOS. Samsung Weather gives you most of the staples you expect from that type of app , like temperature, UV index, and so on. However, one notable omission of late has been pollen counts. For some reason, Samsung decided to get rid of the pollen tracker back in the One UI 7 days. Allergy sufferers quickly noticed the loss, as disgruntled posts on Reddit and Samsung’s own forums attest. At best, people could still dig into Weather.com through a buried link at the bottom of the app, but the dedicated pollen cards were gone. It looks like that might be about to change.

A new update to the system launcher suggests that Google’s planning to drop Discover and move your watchlist to the Home tab.

Update: September 22, 2025 (4:40 PM ET): We have spotted a notice on Android TV warning users that the Discover tab will soon disappear. The notice states that “Your recommendations and watchlist will move to the ‘Home’ tab.”",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Gemini can answer questions about the contents of your device’s screen, but only after you tap an “Ask about screen” button. Gemini appears to be working on a new mode that would infer when you’re talking about your screen, and then automatically analyze it. Google would also offer settings to disable this functionality, so Gemini would need explicit permission to look at your screen. How many different ways does Google give you to make sense out of what you’re seeing on your Android phone’s screen? You could open a screenshot in Lens if you were trying to be as clunky as possible, or just pull up Circle to Search for some quick analysis. Now we’ve also got Gemini ready to lend a hand, and its “Ask about screen” mode is already a deceptively powerful tool. Today we’re checking out one small way that Google could make this screen-searching solution even more streamlined.

To be clear, Visible will not be opening its own stores or abandoning its online-first model, but customers can now sign up for service directly at Best Buy locations nationwide. Best Buy will provide SIM cards, device compatibility checks, and face-to-face support for customers who are interested in Visible but turned off by its current online-only model.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung will stop using OneDrive as a cloud backup option in the Gallery app. Instead, the company will use its own cloud solution to back up your data. There’s no date yet for when OneDrive support will end. If you have syncing enabled in the Samsung Gallery app, then your photos will automatically be backed up to the cloud. Not only does this allow you to access your photos from other devices, but it’s also nice knowing you won’t lose your precious moments if anything happens to your phone. For cloud storage, the Gallery app has long supported Microsoft’s OneDrive. However, that status quo may change soon, as Samsung is looking to go in a different direction.

Gemini has already made some big strides to replace Assistant across Google’s ecosystem — plus just inject a fresh dose of AI assistance into corners that didn’t even have any yet. Right now we’re not just looking forward to the Gemini-fication of Google Home , but Gemini also coming to Google TV . Back in May, we learned that TCL would lead that charge as the first manufacturer to deliver a Gemini-equipped screen, and just the other week, we saw TCL introduce the QM9K , its first Gemini model. Now we’re finally getting the all-important details about how you can take one of these TVs home. TCL gets sales of the QM9K started in the US today, where you’ll be able to find the set available in four different sizes at Best Buy.",

Users can choose to allow Auto Blocker to automatically re-enable itself after 30 minutes of being turned off, balancing security and enthusiast needs. One UI 6 introduced Auto Blocker to Samsung Galaxy devices to keep users safe from various security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks. Users can block app installation from unauthorized sources, block commands and software updates through a USB cable, and even block malware images in messaging apps. It’s a good feature for the broader consumer base, but Auto Blocker can be annoying for enthusiasts since it blocks app sideloading . As a result, many power users choose to disable Auto Blocker entirely, which isn’t ideal. With One UI 8.5, Samsung is working on a compromise that works out for enthusiasts too, letting them choose to turn on Auto Blocker automatically after some time.

The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

A few months ago, I started thinking about switching to a Pixel for the first time since the Pixel 3 XL. After the Pixel 10 launched, I pulled the trigger and bought a 10 Pro . After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place. Toggling all of the alarms in a group with the press of a single button saves time and is so much easier than having to scroll through a list of alarms to find the right ones.",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

A phone that, without a doubt, looks more like a fashion statement than a power user’s dream. But when I saw it, I saw something I don’t usually feel with new phones anymore. A minimalist phone that serves my essential needs and nothing more. As a millennial with Gen Z tendencies, it’s pretty clear that I’m the audience for this phone. Every September, iPhones get bigger, heavier, and more stuffed with specs. It’s the progression of tech, and by and large, people value a phone by its hardware-to-dollar quotient. But with the iPhone Air, Apple has gone in the opposite direction. The phone is built impossibly slim, almost delicate, like a product designed as much as the set piece of a fashion-forward futuristic movie as for the Apple Store. It reminds me of the first-generation iPod nano. I scoffed at it when it launched. Then got my hands on it. It quickly became my favorite EDC kit. And that’s exactly why I didn’t scoff at the iPhone Air. Hindsight is 20/20.",

Despite the importance of these medical devices in many people’s lives, Android doesn’t treat them any differently than other Bluetooth peripherals. The operating system is designed to maximize privacy and battery life, which forces medical device makers to jump through hoops to ensure their apps operate reliably. These apps must request a host of permissions during setup and then hope the OS doesn’t terminate their background processes — a dangerous possibility, since any lapse in reporting can become a life-or-death situation for users.",

All three carriers have closed at least some of their locations and made moves to reduce their reliance on third-party stores, all while raising sales goals to nearly unachievable levels. The result has been widespread burnout and high turnover. It’s clear that carriers now view retail stores as an expensive legacy cost rather than a core part of their strategy. This raises the question: are we headed toward a future where the big three operate mostly, or even entirely, online? While this might seem like a big leap at first, the groundwork is already in place for T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T and Verizon could follow in the coming years. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how the industry is shifting and whether an online-only future may be on the horizon.",

The alert claims the selected title is not valid for Digital purchase on the Kindle, even when the book was loaded via USB or email rather than bought through Amazon’s storefront. Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected. Oddly enough, if you navigate by tapping the three dots, then Go to, then select a chapter, you can crack open affected books.

Teams are finishing integration of the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis II test flight with its launch abort system on Sept. 17 inside the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 44-foot-tall tower-like abort structure would swiftly carry the four-person crew inside Orion to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency during launch or ascent atop the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. Over the next few weeks, teams will complete remaining closeout activities before moving the spacecraft to its final stop before the launch pad: the agency’s Vehicle Assembly Building. There it will be added to the top of the rocket, before the finished stack is rolled out to the launch pad on its way to the Moon. The abort system is comprised of three solid rocket motors :&nbsp;the jettison, attitude, and abort motors. In the case of an emergency, these motors work together to propel the astronauts inside Orion’s crew module to safety: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle; the attitude control motor steers and orients th…",

About a month from now, Microsoft will be launching its ROG Xbox Ally devices. These Xbox-branded gaming handhelds are technically supposed to be the first to debut Microsoft’s new gaming mode for Windows 11. I say technically because it looks like some Windows handheld PC owners found a way to get the highly-anticipated Xbox mode running early on their older hardware. If you’re not in the know, Xbox mode is a new gaming mode for Windows 11 that’s optimized for handheld systems. It was a feature Microsoft announced along with the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X earlier this year. This special configuration suppresses unnecessary background processes and doesn’t run Explorer, allowing devices to save about 2GB of memory, which can be redirected toward gaming.",

With relatively low adoption in the US and advertisers favoring YouTube instead, Google seems to be rethinking parts of the TV platform, starting with a potential refresh of the home screen design. As spotted by 9to5Google , the update is showing up through an apparent server-side change on top of Google TV Home version 1.0.806977084. Navigation is split into two pill-shaped clusters that sit above the content feed. One holds “Home,” “Live,” and “Apps” alongside a search shortcut, while the other contains quick-access buttons for settings and the screensaver. A built-in tooltip even explains the switch, noting that “For You” has been renamed “Home” and that search now lives in this section.",

    "body": "TL;DR Prime members can currently claim three free months of Kindle Unlimited if they are not already a subscriber. Kindle Unlimited provides access to millions of titles and works on Kindle devices and the free Kindle app. The promo is part of the lead-up to this year’s Prime Big Deal Days beginning on October 7, 2025. Amazon is already baiting book lovers ahead of its October Prime Big Deal Days. Right now, members can sign up for three months of Kindle Unlimited at no cost, running back a similar promo we saw ahead of Prime Day in July. Normally $11.99 a month, Kindle Unlimited unlocks millions of ebook titles, plus audiobooks, comics, and magazines. With a subscription, users can borrow up to 20 titles at a time, which is ambitious even for the most committed of bedrotters. You also don’t need a Kindle to utilize Kindle Unlimited, since everything included works seamlessly in the free Kindle app on Android (or iOS). In other words, if you don’t have a Kindle, you can still sign up for the free period and read or listen on your phone or tablet.",

Because of this, right-handed users may accidentally end up covering the mic while recording videos in landscape mode. Rotating the phone can help, but it may feel awkward. If you recently bought a Pixel 10 Pro XL and are experiencing audio issues in landscape videos, you’re not alone. Google changed the bottom speaker and microphone positions on the new flagship compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. So the main speaker now sits on the right of the USB-C port, making it less likely for you to accidentally cover it while gaming, watching videos, or holding the phone in landscape mode.",

Along the way, a partnership between NASA wind tunnel engineers, data visualization scientists, and software developers verified a quick, cost-effective solution to improve NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) rocket for the upcoming Artemis II mission. This will be the first crewed flight of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, on an approximately 10-day journey around the Moon. &nbsp; A high-speed network connection between high-end computing resources at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility and the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel , both located at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California&#8217;s Silicon Valley, is enabling a collaboration to improve the rocket for the Artemis II mission. During the Artemis I test flight, the SLS rocket experienced higher-than-expected vibrations near the solid rocket booster attach points, caused by unsteady airflow between the gap. One solution proposed for Artemis II was adding four strakes. A strake is a thin, fin-like structure commonly us…",
