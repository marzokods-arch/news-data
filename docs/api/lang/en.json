So why is it Valve has killed the Index branding entirely with its latest arrival, a new VR headset called the Steam Frame ? Turns out, it's exactly because Valve doesn't want that sense of continuity between the two. \"This is a new product. That's one of the reasons we changed the name from Valve index to Steam Frame, because we're trying to do something new with this,\" says Jeremy Selan, an engineer at Valve, during our visit to the company. \"We're really trying to blur the lines from your catalogue, where you just think about, you have your games, this is another device that lets you enjoy them. So I don't want to put too many sort of preconceived expectations on how people will use this.\" The Valve Index is an accessory for a gaming PC. Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so. The Steam Frame contains its own Arm-based processor and runs SteamOS to be able to play games without requiring a second PC. It's a great experience, too, as you can read in my Steam Frame hands-on . \"If you think about the Valve Index, awesome…",

But then its battle royale mode Redsec came out, and the live-service gears shrieked into motion with a disappointing new map and weekly challenges that mandated battle royale play, putting a decisive end to Battlefield 6's honeymoon period. With BF Studios rushing to quell these issues as Steam reviews drop to Mixed, Battlefield 6's developers have also addressed the situation. Speaking to IGN , design director Justin Wiebe assured players that the studio is \"always listening\". \"As soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community',\" Wiebe explained. \"If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it.

With prototype Steam Machines heading out to reviewers back in 2013, us included , the company had grand plans of reinventing what constitutes a gaming PC around its new creation, a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. Years on, and following a few failed partner launches that you can read all about in our retrospective of their demise , the project was more or less doomed. By 2018, Valve pulled the plug . Or did it? Valve never stopped working on SteamOS, plugging away until it landed on the successful formula launched inside the Steam Deck in 2022. Following this success, Valve feels ready to take a second punt at a system with more firepower. \"We finally have all the software and the hardware bits to make the original vision a reality,\" Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, says during my visit to Valve HQ. They mention it's the right time because users are already making Steam Machines happen, putting a recovery image of SteamOS onto a range of devices or using their Steam Deck while docked. \"Our c…",

Valve has given its latest creation the same name as its previous star-crossed product, but this new model is going to be far less divisive than the original. Of that, I am absolutely sure. The idea behind the Steam Controller is that it allows you to interact with your PC while on your sofa or away from a desk with the accuracy of a mouse, without actually requiring one. This is, and always has been, a good idea. Where people differ is on whether the original manifestation of the Steam Controller, first released in 2015, was any good or not. I never used it for long enough to get to grips with it—which was, in large part, the problem with it. Some here at PC Gamer own the controller, but rarely, if ever, used it. Others here actively despise it. I imagine that represents a pretty good cross section of the wider PC gaming community. But it's important to note that there remains a small number of people that argue that it was, in fact, a good controller. It even has a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam to this day. The original controller was discontinued around the time it became clear …",

This isn't the Valve Index 2, it's something quite different, but it should still appeal to hardcore VR users and new users alike. The Steam Frame is a standalone VR headset. It doesn't require a PC in order to play games or watch videos in VR. It doesn't need base stations or a cable, either. It's powered by SteamOS, Valve's own Linux distro used on the Steam Deck , and an Arm chip. So, what makes this a PCVR headset again? \"We see Steam Frame as a streaming first headset,\" Lawrence Yang, a designer at Valve, tells me. Streaming in this context does not refer to cloud streaming or showcasing your skills on Twitch. Rather streaming means playing a game on a gaming PC and streaming it over to the Steam Frame via a wireless connection. So, you're streaming the game from one PC to another PC on your head, without using any cables.

I can finally let those frustrating memories go—Raccoin's machines will let me win, and win spectacularly. The structure is simple—each round, I get a certain number of coin drops (which I can aim rather more precisely than with a real machine) and have to try and reach that round's target score. That score translates to prize tickets, and between rounds I can tip the odds in my favour by spending them on special coins, power-ups, and passive bonuses. It's a very simple thrill at first.

I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be. To what's right for them. It started with custom PCs, moved on to keyboards, and is now spilling over into almost every area imaginable in this humble little hobby of ours. This isn't the first time we've seen custom mice; ones with swappable plates and grips have existed before the Pathfinder, but no other comes even close to matching what Orbital provides with this setup. It's utterly astonishing. Is this the best wireless gaming mouse of 2025? Honestly? Probably.

In simple terms, it comes down to the way the EUV light diffracts and distorts as it passes through the various lenses, reflectors and apertures of the mind-boggling complex ASML lithography machines used by TSMC to manufacture the most advanced chips.

    "body": "According to Windows Latest , popular messaging service WhatsApp is downgrading its Windows 11 app to a WebView2 equivalent in the latest update, switching from a native Windows application to a web wrapper that loads the browser version instead. As a result, Windows Latest reports that WhatsApp version 2.2584.3.0 can use up to 2 GB of RAM under heavy conditions, which seems like a pretty wild amount of memory usage for what is essentially a chat service with image and video support. The app was originally based around a web wrapper, but switched to a native Windows UWP version several years ago. As most of my friends and family use the service, I've got the old WhatsApp version open on my machine at all times. It's currently sitting at 124.6 MB of RAM usage with many ongoing chats open, so this sounds like a significant downgrade for an app that, for many, is their primary way of keeping in touch with their pals. I haven't received the update yet, so I've been unable to test it myself to confirm these figures. Windows Latest, however, says it's been told \"all users will be logged out eventually and forced to use the WebView2-based WhatsApp.\" It's worth noting that the browser-bas…",

I was a big fan of the original Framework 16 machine, bringing with it the possibility of a genuinely modular gaming laptop that could grow over the years in the same way a normal desktop rig can. And now here is the theoretically inevitable upgrade, bringing Nvidia's RTX Blackwell architecture as a slot-in option for Framework's 16-incher. I say 'theoretically inevitable' only because that was effectively the promise Framework made upon launch of the original Framework 16 . Yet no other company has managed this feat, with such luminaries as Dell/Alienware being the most notable of failures . So, there's been a little niggle at the base of my brainstem since launch that maybe it might not happen this time, either. Released at the start of 2024, things looked relatively rosy for the Framework 16, with AMD onboard, helping create the modular Radeon 7700S GPU that was to form the backbone of the first graphics expansion bay. Then the red team just kinda gave up on mobile graphics cards for laptops, and that looked more than mildly worrying for the future of this modular gaming notebook. Indee…",

That's been ingrained into my brain ever since the heyday of online forums. So I'm more than a little interested in cyberspace.online , a social media site that is \"how the internet was supposed to be\" (via Hackaday ). The most immediately striking thing about it is its aesthetic, which is pulled straight from my childhood dreams of what hacking would probably be like: green terminals and lots of '@' usernames. You can theme it with any colours and border sizing you like, but it comes with some pre-mades, including C64 , VT320 , and green Matrix options. Personally, while I don't know if I could stand it long-term, I like the VT320 one because it reminds me of Hacker: Evolution . Once the novelty of the theming has worn off, as it surely will, you might wonder what there is to actually do in cyberspace.online.

We got to peep a new trailer showing off Bowser Jr (voiced by Benny Safdie) and the undisputed best princess in the Mario universe Rosalina (Brie Larson) alongside the return of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and a miniature Bowser—who was shrunk at the end of the first movie, if you forgot. Bowser seems to have taken to a bit of a Rapunzel lifestyle, chilling inside a toy-sized castle and painting diabolical works of art where he's a jacked-up hot bro. For whatever reason Bowser Jr.'s debut gets hit with the Prowler sound effect from Into the Spiderverse, and it looks like he'll be replacing his papa as the sequel's antagonist. The trailer finds just enough time to squeeze in an appearance from my beloved Rosalina at the end making quick work of a Megaleg before making way for the movie's release date: April 3, 2026.

We've seen its effectiveness when implemented on some of our favourite AM4 gaming processors of old, and it's also turned up in a more recent Zen 4 chip, the Ryzen 5 7600X3D, and the Zen 5-based Ryzen 7 9800X3D , our pick as the best gaming CPU overall. The trouble is, 3D V-Cache-equipped AM5 chips are usually quite pricey. Those looking for a properly sub-$300 beastie with AMD's game-crunching cache tech (the 7600X3D has an MSRP of $299, and usually retails for a lot higher than that) have traditionally had to make do with chips built for the previous-gen AM4 socket, like the Ryzen 5 5700X3D . No longer, it seems. Enter, the Ryzen 5 7500X3D—a $269/£245 six-core, 12-thread AM5 ch…",

There's something alluring about a game running on a CRT monitor , so they took it upon themselves to bring gaming on a small CRT display into the modern age, all in a somewhat-portable format. The donor screen came from a portable Sony TV of what looks like early 90s stock, which at the time would have been a cutting edge device.

Not because he would have made the game differently, but because he hated the term so much, he wanted to change it. Speaking on the Shooter Monthly podcast (via TheGamePost ), Bungie's former director of product management Chris Sides said that he thought about collaborating with the studio's marketing team to come up with a different term for extraction shooters, one that presumably would have been pushed in the runup to Marathon's launch. The reason for this, Sides says, is the vagueness of the term. \"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter.

This is why the creation of Steve, a mod that implements AI \"agents\" powered by systems like OpenAI and Gemini into the game, could be the best friend of players in need of an extra pair of hands. Created by YuvDwi and shared on GitHub, the Steve mod is pretty straightforward to understand. Essentially, it adds LLM-powered AI agents directly into Minecraft, which respond to your commands and play alongside you. This means you'll have a gaggle of Steves to boss around and ask to do tasks you simply cannot be bothered to do, or the ones you need some extra help with, like culling a bunch of sheep or mining for a specific resource. As stated in the mod's description, the agents \"aren't following predefined scripts\" either.

Gogmazios was teased back during September's Tokyo Game Show, in what's set to be the monster's second ever outing in the series. We haven't seen Gogmazios since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate all the way back in 2015, where he served as the ultimate final boss. It's been a long decade since then, but we'll be Gog gaming when Title Update 4 drops on December 16. There wasn't much else to say in the State of Play, unfortunately—bar \"additions to the endgame\" and \"seasonal events\" if you're particularly jazzed about more Festivals of Accord—but a follow-up post from the Monster Hunter account on X has me a little more excited. It promises \"weapon buffs\" along with \"performance improvements and more!\" Anyone who's attempted to put their poor rig through a number of hours in Monster Hunter Wilds will know that the game kinda sucks on PC. I'm not running a souped-up rig by any stretch of the imagination, but Wilds battered my…",

It's a 27-inch model running at 1440p and features a swing-down charging hook for DualSense Playstation controllers. Specs wise, the information Sony has released places the new panel towards the lower end of the mid-tier in a PC gaming monitor context with an IPS panel and 240 Hz refresh rate. Though the 240 Hz is only available when hooked up to a PC. It'll run at 120 Hz connected to PlayStation consoles. Aside from the resolution, refresh rate and panel type, the rest of the speeds and feeds are unclear. Sony doesn't quote response times or brightness. Even the quoted HDR capability is awfully vague. \"High Dynamic Range support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping that automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring rich and vivid picture quality,\" is what Sony says, which could mean almost anything from very basic HDR signal support right through to full-array local dimming. That said, you might have expected Sony to make a big deal about any fancy backlight tech on offer. So, we're probably talking about the most basic entry-level HDR support for this monitor.

This set of comforting, coffee shop simulators lets you live out this fantasy, master the wizardry of latte art, all while befriending your customers and unravelling their stories along the way. However, the next chapter of the Coffee Talk series will whisk us to a much more lively location: the bustling city of Tokyo. And, as announced during the State of Play on November 11, we can expect to embark on this all-new adventure on March 5. But despite its busy setting, Coffee Talk Tokyo will still offer \"a cosy place to be\" for anyone who passes through its doors, which is bound to be a welcome relief in a virtual rendition of the most populated city in the world. If you've played either of the Coffee Talk games before, you'll know what the general routine is like, and Coffee Talk Tokyo won't be making too many changes.

The point is, you don't mess with Arc machines unless you're prepared. These all pale in comparison to the Queen, the largest Arc currently in the game, which you can only encounter during the Harvester map event. These towering, spider-like monstrosities guard the Harvester and will rain mortar fire, laser beams, charges, and EMPs down on those brave (or stupid) enough to challenge them. It turns out you needn't be all that scared of the Queen, though. Why? Because you can burn through their roughly 33,000 health with just a single, blue-quality Blaze Grenade Trap.

Now we've seen it: in a surprise trailer during Sony's Japan-focused State of Play livestream on Tuesday, the studio debuted The Forsaken Hollows , its first expansion dropping December 4. And one of the studio's all-time great bosses is coming back. At the 1:15 mark in the trailer above, Artorias of the Abyss from the first Dark Souls appears as a new addition to the pool of bosses you'll have to face before one of the end-of-run Nightlords. He's not the first Dark Souls boss to apear in Nightreign: DS1's Gaping Dragon is in the game, too, as one of the easier bosses to dispatch. Something tells me Artorias will be a bit more of a challenge. That something is probably my memory of fighting Artorias in his namesake DLC for Dark Souls, Artorias of the Abyss, released in 2012. While FromSoftware's games are quite fast-paced today, demanding quick reflexes in fights against the likes of Malenia , that wasn't the case in Dark Souls. Many of the bosses are lumbering beasts, and even the fastest foes hav…",

During today's Japan-focused State of Play, Koei Tecmo announced that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake will launch on March 12, 2026. That's excellent news for the folks who spent 1999 through 2005 jumping between numbered Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Fatal Frame games, long before all three series took breaks with spin-offs or went quiet. 2012 marks the last time Japan's horror trio released something more significant than a remaster within the same six months—the year Resident Evil 6, Silent Hill: Downpour, and the Wii-exclusive Fatal Frame 2 remake launched. Fatal Frame saw a couple of remasters in recent years, but those weren't quite as extensive as what Koei shared today. And yes, you read that correctly. This is the second remake of the second Fatal Frame, though folks in North America never had the chance to play the 2012 one. During the State of Play, Fatal Frame series director Makoto Shibata explained the \"meticulous\" attention to detail that went into new lighting and textures for the fan favorite. He also highlighted how Team Ninja's action direc…",

FromSoftware dropped a jam-packed trailer at Sony's State of Play today that has glimpses of a transformed map, new characters, new bosses, and enemies returning from the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. It's called The Forsaken Hollows, and the first thing we see is a few quick shots of knights and caves not in the base game. In fact, the entire Limveil map has been transformed by a new event called The Great Hollow. \"A great cavity in the depths of Limveld,\" is how the post on the PlayStation Blog describes it. It's a big hole with a big crystal and everything down there looks terrifying. To fight the new horrors are two new characters: The Scholar and The Undertaker. The Undertaker is a strength- and faith-based character who wields a mace and has an ultimate that sends her flying up to attack enemies. The Scholar looks less mobile, but equipped with a tome he can use to lift enemies up in place. The PlayStation Blog confirms that there are two new Nightlord bosses to fight at the end of each run. One of them is a battalion of angelic knights holding golden spears and the other is, well, some kind of twisted abomination that roars ju…",

In a follow-up post , Sweeney doubled down: \"This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines.\" I'm not sure that's accurate—my perception is that the divide isn't along political lines so much as it is between billionaires (like Sweeney) who tend to view generative AI as a way to crank out more content with less expense , …",

Much like Skyrim's Anniversary Edition upgrade, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition's main attractions are paid mods called Creations. These have been in the game since 2017, but now Fallout 4 is moving away from the \"Creation Club\" branding in favor of the simpler \"Creations\" menu featured in both Skyrim and Starfield.
