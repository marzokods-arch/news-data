Minutes later, Rose returned to the stage and addressed the situation with a terse, âSo, Iâll just try and wing this,â before continuing the set. On Tuesday (Oct. 22), the band released a statement via social media explaining the cause of the disruption. According to the post, the issue stemmed from an in-ear monitor malfunction. âDuring the opening song at our recent Buenos Aires concert, Axlâs in-ear monitor pack had only the percussion in his ears versus his entire mix,â the statement read. âThe issue was fixed by our tech team by the third song, and we had a great night.
