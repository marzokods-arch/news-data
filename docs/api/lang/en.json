This comes despite Samsung’s own Galaxy S25 phones being conservative upgrades. Apple announced the iPhone 17 series this week, and there are a few reasons to be excited about these devices. All models have a nifty square selfie camera, there’s a super-slim iPhone Air (if you care about a slim and light design), and Pro models get a 48MP 4x camera with 8x lossless zoom. However, Samsung has inevitably criticized Apple’s launch event on Twitter , calling it a “Zzz-note.” The company posted the tweet as part of a competition announcement, where it promises to give away a Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. US Twitter users can enter by responding to the post and telling Samsung why they want to switch to Galaxy devices.",

Back in June, a leak claimed that the next flagship from OnePlus would have a “SuperBlack” colorway . This black color reportedly has a very high light absorption rate, high enough that “the body looks like a black hole.” But what will this color be called? And while on that topic, what other colors will be available on the OnePlus 15? A new leak may have shed some light on those questions. The leak about the “SuperBlack” color came from trusted tipster Digital Chat Station, who is back with another color-related leak.

    "body": "TL;DR EU energy labels offer a convenient way to see how many times you can charge your phone before losing capacity. Samsung’s been a leader there, claiming 2,000 cycles for devices like its Galaxy S25 phones. Apple only manages to hit 1,000 cycles, according to its iPhone 17 energy labels. Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles. But how does that compare to the new iPhone 17 family?",

It appears that the screws that hold the ring to the magnetic panel are becoming loose. One of the more exciting aspects of the Pixel 10’s launch was the announcement of the new Pixelsnap accessories . These MagSafe-like items can magnetically snap onto the Pixel 10 without the need for a special case. Now that the Pixel 10 has been out for a couple of weeks, plenty of owners have had the opportunity to use these products. Although they have only been available for a short amount of time, it appears one Pixelsnap accessory is already running into issues. Spotted by 9to5Google , multiple reports are coming in through Reddit about a problem with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. According to the reports, the issue deals with the screws near the hinge, which keep the metal ring attached to the magnetic panel and provide the resistance to prop the Pixel 10 up. These users claim that the screws are becoming undone.",

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

The more compact, color-screen consumer glasses might not arrive until 2027. Amazon’s track record with tech hardware is a bit mixed, to put it lightly. We’ve seen some epic failures over the years, like the disaster that was the Fire Phone, and while its Echo smart speakers have been market leaders, it’s still very unclear if Alexa Plus is going to give all those smart home devices the boost they need to remain competitive. Today we’re hearing about some ambitious plans to expand its hardware lineup, with a report outlining the company’s goals for two new AR solutions. Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects. Last year, we heard that Amazon could be building an AR pair of its own , though one that would be focused on assisting its delivery drivers. In a new report, The Information says those plans are still on track, and will also be joined by a consumer-oriented pair of AR glasses.",

Samsung launched the slim Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, and now Apple has launched the slightly slimmer iPhone Air . We’ve even seen this war extend to foldable phones in 2025. Apple claims the iPhone Air is just 5.6mm thin. However, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge and most other phones, this measurement doesn’t include the camera bump. You only need to look at the picture above to realize that it has a sizeable camera bump. In fact, it might be larger than the S25 Edge’s camera housing.",

The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

    "body": "TL;DR A hidden feature in Android 16 QPR1 offers a new, faster way to reorganize your Quick Settings tiles. Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

However, only the Libra was available in a white and black build, while the Clara was limited to black.

The phone will apparently use a 3x camera with a smaller sensor, suggesting lower quality photos. We’ve already seen some Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra camera leaks, and we most recently heard that the 3x camera could get a new sensor. Now, it sounds like this might be a downgrade. Tipster Ice Universe claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 Ultra won’t have a 12MP 3x camera as he previously asserted. Or more accurately, the phone will apparently have a 12MP sensor that crops down to 10MP . That means the native image resolution is unchanged compared to the S25 Ultra.",

This move is similar to what Spotify did, a change it eventually reversed after user backlash. Spotify and YouTube Music are reasonably competitive in their features , with each service having some nice extras. Spotify Connect is a lifesaver if you have multiple devices, whereas YouTube Music being bundled in YouTube Premium works out in its favor. Both services have been trying to convert more of their free users into becoming paid customers, and now it seems YouTube Music is borrowing a leaf out of Spotify’s book by paywalling the lyrics feature. Reddit user Xinfinte spotted that they had limited views of lyrics remaining on YouTube Music. The app prompted them to upgrade to Premium to unlock lyrics beyond the free limit.",

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

This update comes with firmware version F766NKSU4AYI1 for the Flip 7 and F966NKSU4AYI1 for the Fold 7. If you live outside of South Korea, then you won’t see this update waiting for you. However, it’s possible this update will roll out to other markets in the near future.",

I know, the game had been out for more than five years at that point, but it was my reintroduction to handheld gaming after nearly a decade of nothing but online live service games. And I was hooked. Now that Hollow Knight: Silksong is out, I wanted to continue the trend of playing on a handheld rather than my gaming PC. But the landscape has changed since then, and now phones and Android gaming handhelds are more powerful than ever. Before I dusted off my chunky ROG Ally, I thought: Can I play this on my Android phone?",

No other details were given, so it was anyone’s guess as to how soon “soon” would actually be. But we now have a definitive answer to that question. Once again, Nothing has turned to social media to offer more information about its next flagship TWS earbuds . This time, the company has revealed the launch date for the Nothing Ear (3). As it turns out, we’ll only have to wait a little over a week for the official announcement. According to the post, Nothing will launch the new earbuds on September 18, which is next Thursday.",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a feature within Gemini that suggests follow-up questions. The suggestion prompts help users explore topics and engage in in-depth conversations to get more out of their AI interactions. The feature seems to be a limited test for now. If you’re old enough to have used search engines before their AI-fication, you’re most likely using your AI digital assistant more like a search engine and less like a digital assistant. That means more one-off queries and fewer conversations, which is the way many of us are used to Googling. The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further. With Google app v16.34.58, Telegram user @blank94855 spotted that Google is testing a new feature within Gemini where the AI-based digital assistant will suggest follow-up questions based on your original query.",

It might not be everyone’s preferred third-party launcher these days, but it’s been my pick for as long as I can remember. As someone who swaps phones regularly, Nova has been my consistent home base in a sea of OEM homescreens, some good but many far less so. Whether it’s setting my preferred app drawer layout or augmenting icons with custom gestures, Nova has usually exceeded the capabilities of stock launchers, which is reason enough to be upset at its demise.",

This would enable brighter, cleaner shots, particularly in low-light conditions. It would also allow for 5x portrait snaps with more natural bokeh effects. The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leaks continue to stream in, and we recently saw camera specs surface online . Now, a trusted leaker has revealed even more details about the Ultra phone’s camera hardware. Tipster Ice Universe has claimed on Twitter that the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 50MP 5x camera will have an f/2.9 aperture. That’s significantly wider than the S25 Ultra’s f/3.4 shooter. So what does that mean for users, then?",

The new lens supposedly has a narrower f/2.8 aperture, a downgrade from the OnePlus 13’s f/2.6 aperture. Another possible leak suggests the OnePlus 15 might be cheaper due to cost-cutting measures, including a different display and the end of the Hasselblad partnership. OnePlus makes some excellent Android flagships , and the current generation OnePlus 13 checks all the right boxes, so we’re very excited to see what the company has in store for its successor, the OnePlus 15 (Chinese culture regards the number “4” as unlucky). The company recently confirmed that its Hasselblad partnership is over, and that it is building its own DetailMax Engine for photography. Now, more specifications of the OnePlus 15’s camera have leaked, and there’s both good and bad news. Leaker Digital Chat Station has shared that the OnePlus 15 could come with a 50MP periscope telephoto camera. This camera could have an 85mm equivalent focal length and f/2.8 aperture.",
