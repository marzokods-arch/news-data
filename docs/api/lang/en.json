    "body": "Metallica knows that the easiest way to a fan&#8217;s heart is through a taste of homegrown rock. The metal giants are currently pounding their way through a long-overdue tour of Australia and New Zealand , a six-date coast-to-coast swing for the M72 World Tour . When the “One” rockers visited Adelaide Oval on Wednesday night, Nov. 5, the setlist included many favorites from across their decorated, Rock Hall-inducted career &#8212; plus some legendary local music. Fan-filmed footage shows Metallica pumped out a cover of INXS&#8217; Billboard Hot 100 leader &#8220;Need You Tonight&#8221;. Then, a segue into the Angels’ classic from 1976, “Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again,” led by bass player Robert Trujillo at the mic. It’s a song that courses through the bloodstream of every Australian weaned on guitar music, and has somehow evolved with a call-and-respond that has passed down the generations. When the song is played, tradition requires fans to roar “no way, get f&#8212;ed, f&#8212; off.” Of course, that happened in the City of Churches.

This special version of the Gemini model will be used to power the next generation of Siri. This represents Apple’s desperation to enter the AI race, especially with its inability to build a model comparable to Google’s Gemini. Voice assistants from tech brands like Google and Amazon have recently undergone significant enhancements powered by AI. Both Alexa+ and Gemini, which has replaced Google Assistant , are now available to users for testing and critique. In the meantime, Apple’s ambitions to catch up to its competitors with Siri continue to drag on . Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner . Over the weekend, Bloomberg ‘s Mark Gurman reported that with the expected timeline for releasing a revamped Siri drawing closer, Apple has decided to use Gemini to power Siri’s next generation.

The rock ‘n’ roll stars have made themselves at home, and made their feeling clear on dodgy ticket resales, which didn&#8217;t materialize due to the state of Victoria&#8217;s tough anti-touting laws . Under those rules, tickets can’t be resold for more than 10 per cent above the face value, or face fines from A$908 to A$109,044 for individuals or A$545,220 to A$545,000 for corporations. The Oasis tour was listed as a “major event,” and with it was protected under the&nbsp; Major Events Act 2009. As a result, those fans were guarded from paying obscene fees through StubHub or Viagogo, which remains one of live entertainment industry’s mortal enemies. Oasis has applauded the intervention. “It’s great to see Victoria’s Major Events Declaration doing exactly what it’s meant to — Viagogo can’t list our Melbourne shows — and that’s a huge win for real fans,&#8221; reads a s…",

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

If you spend time hiking, driving cross-country, or exploring anywhere off the grid, this one’s worth knowing about. T-Mobile now lets anyone text 911 via satellite , even if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;T. The important thing to know is that you’ll need to sign up first, as it’s free but not automatic. In its press release , T-Mobile explains to those unfamiliar that the Text to 911 feature is part of its T-Satellite system, which connects phones directly to Starlink’s 650-plus low-Earth orbit satellites. That network covers roughly half a million square miles of the US where normal cell service doesn’t reach. Once you’ve enrolled, your phone will automatically connect to “T-Mobile TXT911” when you’re outside tower range, showing a satellite icon on Android or “LTE” on the iPhone 13.",

First teased earlier this year, the company finally revealed the Pocket VERT earlier today in the YouTube video shown above. As promised, it’s a glamorous take on the Game Boy, with a CNC-machined body and “diamond-cut” shoulder buttons.

It remains to be seen where else Galaxy XR will launch, but a new leak suggests Samsung has some significant plans for expansion in 2026. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too.

The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop.

It should represent one of the best implementations of the 8 Elite Gen 5, but we’ll let the results do the talking.

However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap.

Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness .

That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Recently, some T-Mobile Android users have received a message stating “com.applovin.array.apphub.tmobile uninstalled successfully.” The notice refers to the removal of AppHub, a preinstalled app from AppLovin that functioned as an app recommendation platform. AppHub was discontinued after reports showed it could silently install apps, so the uninstall message reflects its permanent removal and is not a system error or bug. As first spotted on Reddit by user OkAsk3950 , it seems many Android-owning T-Mobile customers have recently received the same message: “com.applovin.array.apphub.tmobile uninstalled successfully”. So what is this app exactly, and why is it suddenly being removed without warning? It turns out that this has to do with a pre-installed app called AppHub. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
