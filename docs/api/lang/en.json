In Thailand, it’s actually a pretty common name. It’s used more often for girls than boys, though,” he laughs. When BamBam left Bangkok for Seoul in 2010, he was just 14 years old.

The seven-member GOT7 is a truly multinational group, featuring BamBam, Jackson Wang from Hong Kong and Mark Tuan, who is Taiwanese-American. Perhaps because of this diversity, GOT7 quickly built a global fandom, holding world tours that reached beyond Asia to North and South America, Australia and Europe — faster than most K-pop groups that debuted around the same time.
