I came into it with this expectation that it was going to be a simple, easy, plug-and-play, get-it-tested-and-done article. A lengthy piece about a $4,000 laptop, brimming with hardware, glowing with accolades and triumphs on its legendary performance and impressive build quality. Yet on my first bout with the Gen 10, it left me sorely disappointed, more so because of my own hubris and oversight than because of the laptop itself. The thing is, I didn't know it then, I didn't understand what it was capable of, and after multiple weeks of testing, re-testing, and really getting under the skin of the Legion 9i, I am now a convert. Hands-down, it is, without a doubt, one of the best gaming laptops I've ever had the privilege of playing with. Albeit with a few minor caveats to that glowing recommendation. So, let's start with the specs first, because it's a whole cornucopia of madness depending on which side of that big Atlantic fish-pond you live on. The model I have here for review is the 18IAX10, complete with Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and RTX 5080 16 GB (capped at a beautiful 1…",

Look at those things. \"Ready up with this controller-meets-clog design that reimagines the iconic Xbox controller with fixed buttons and joysticks into the perfect shoe for couch co-op and kicking back,\" goes the Xbox marketing blurb, like it's describing something perfectly normal and not an abrogation of humanity's duty to treat the Earth's fruits with care and respect. The part I find most displeasing, personally, are the analogue sticks, which arise like malignant fungal nodules from the dorsa of both of your feet.

Hence, diligent, accurate crediting is important for any creative's career, as well as just being the decent thing to do. In most cases, a credit is formulated as the developer's name and the nature of their role on the project, whether that's a fixed job title or a specific type of work they contributed on a part-time or freelance basis. But with the credits for Demonschool , developer Necrosoft Games went one step further, adding paragraph-long descriptions for every role on the project. This was highlighted by Necrosoft's design director Brandon Sheffield, who posted an image of some of Demonschool's credit to demonstrate their approach. \"Often you see credits in games where you don't know what the credited developer was actually responsible for.

You know what else scores 4310 points in that test? Nothing. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D ? 3332. The Core i9 14900KS? 3238. The Core Ultra 9 285K ? 3214. When Apple claimed the ARM-based M5 had the best single-core performance in the world, it sure meant it. But can it game? While you used to be able to buy desktop Macs with Radeon cards in them, we haven't seen that for a while, and no M-series processor has yet been paired with any kind of discrete GPU. Apple instead relies on the integrated graphics cores and, for more powerful desktop machines, its ability to literally glue multiple chips together to increase their number, brute-forcing a solution to the problem by throwing more silicon at it.

Today, Ubisoft continued to pretend it never announced the Far Cry series at FX by announcing the Far Cry series at FX. Again. The details of the show are pretty much what we already knew, but this time, there are quotes to go along with them. So, that's something! \"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo [another FX/Hawley joint] is a variation on a theme,\" said Hawley. Just like the Far Cry games, each season of the show will be \"set in a new setting following a new cast of characters,\" according to Ubisoft. \"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created,\" Mac said, who will executive produce as well as star in the show (presumably in more than just the …",

I'd actually wondered how Steam Awards nominations would be handled in 2025. Typically it happens during the Steam Autumn Sale, but with Valve moving the Autumn Sale back a couple months to give us a proper break before the Winter Sale hits, that wasn't going to be an option. The answer was obvious in hindsight: Just make a whole other sale and cram it in there, which is exactly what Valve did with Steam's first ever Black Friday Sale . The nomination process for this year's Steam Awards will simplify things for you by listing eligible games you've played in 2025, as well as providing a rundown of \"popular and recommended games\" if you're more interested in being on the winning team than in throwing your support behind something you actually enjoyed. There seems to be some kind of obscure eligibility requirements for the recommendation listings, although I haven't been able to suss out exactly what: For the Bes…",

Tavern Keeper arrived on Steam in November, but it's been in development for over a decade—and as impressive as the game is, that's a heck of a long development cycle, especially since it's expected to be in early access for at least another 12 months. I spoke last week with Patrick Klug, director and co-founder of Greenheart Games, and asked why the tavern sim took so long to belly up to the bar. \"We have made, like, six versions of this over the last 11 and a half years,\" Klug said, explaining that just the storybook system alone went through \"dozens of versions\" to become what is essentially an \"interactive audiobook\" where players get to make RPG-like dialogue choices while managing their pub. \"When we started, there were no tavern [management] games.

The two big seasonal sales were separated, literally, by just a couple weeks: The 2024 Autumn Sale wrapped up on December 4, and the Winter Sale kicked off on December 15. That's just too much sale all mush into one month. But if you thought that the shifted Autumn Sale meant no discounts on Steam in late November, boy, were you ever wrong. Because for the first time ever, Valve has capitulated to the gods of e-commerce and is holding its very own Black Friday Sale . Unlike many online retailers, who view Black Friday as one of the most important sell stuff holidays* of the year, Steam's Black Friday Sale is a relatively small affair compared to the seasonal heavyweights: It runs for just one week, and there are no attendant Points Shop freebies or trading cards to earn for hammering through your discovery queue. Which is not to say there aren't some sweet deals on offer, because there are. One obvious choice is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 , which is 60% off its regular price—that's $24/£22/€24, the lowest it'…",

As Tom Warren noted at The Verge , Microsoft did something similar earlier this year for Office, adding a feature called \"Startup Boost\" that loads parts of the Word application in the background so that it can launch more quickly. While I'm all for snappy software, I am a bit skeptical that either Word or the File Explorer should be such heavy applications that they need to be silently loading elements in the background before you click on them.

Even after the tutorial, it's frustrating trying to actually win a match until you unlock the Scholar profession, which isn't made clear at all. To save you a lot of rematches, this guide explains how to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet by unlocking the Scholar profession, and goes through how Gift of the Gab actually works once you can play it without tears dripping onto your keyboard. How to win at Gift of the Gab in Where Winds Meet Let's just get this out of the way first: You're not going to win any Gift of the Gab matches in Where Winds Meet until you complete the Legacy: Scholar's Path quest and unlock the Scholar profession . Despite the fancy concept of studying your opponent's words and picking the correct comeback cards to win, Gift of the Gab is really a stat-based minigame—which means it's only winnable once you have access to stat boosts, card upgrades, and craftable talismans as part of the Scholar skill tree.

Yet whether players liked it or not, pretty much everyone agreed that The Chinese Room's sequel wasn't really a successor to Bloodlines at all, lacking the ridiculous roleplaying depth that makes Troika's original the brilliantly broken bloodsucking adventure it is. In fact, PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens pointed out that the biggest problem with Bloodlines 2 is that it is called Bloodlines 2 . As is so often the case, it appears Bloodlines 2's adoptive developers were highly aware of this potential problem. Speaking to Cat Burton of the Goth Boss Podcast (via PCGamesN ) TCR cofounder Dan Pinchbeck explained how he urged Paradox Interactive not to call Bloodlines 2, well, that . Pinchbeck says that, from the start, The Chinese Room inten…",

Hashino also discussed how he's gearing up for what sounds like a literal upgrade to the JRPG genre, except there are no patch notes yet. As reported by 4gamer and translated by GamesRadar , Hashino sees the genre as three distinct eras—the past (JRPG 1.0), present (JRPG 2.0), and future (JRPG 3.0). The ' ghosts of JRPG past, present, and future ' would have switched up the story of A Christmas Carol a bit, and now I'm wondering what that looks like. According to Hashino, JRPG 1.0 encompasses the \"classics\", which is not a small number of enduring pioneers, including Final Fantasy—which continues to release entries to this day after more than 35 years—alongside Atlus' own Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. JRPG 2.0 is the genre as it is now, the modern iteration with \"its current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player\"…",

It's odd, really, that over half of the game's population on Steam has barely engaged in PvP , and 18% have never even knocked out a raider. Just think of all the loot they could be carrying. Maybe they've even got one of the best guns . But no, instead of encouraging more bloodthirsty raiders Topside, I'd like to do the opposite. After checking out Arc Raiders' achievements on Steam, I was shocked—no, appalled—to learn that less than 15% of players have revived a fellow raider, and that's a crying shame: Today You, Tomorrow Me: Revive an encountered raider with a defibrillator (14.7%) What are we doing here, everyone? Defibrillators are easy to find in Medical areas like Buried City's Hospital, you can craft them, and they're even sold by Lance. So, you've no excuse not to take one into a raid in case a friendly raider needs a helping hand. Ever since being downed by a Rocketeer fighting the Matriarch, only to be revived by a random player and not being able to return the favour when they met the same fate, I always take at least one defibrillator with me.

This week I've been: clearing out my stash and filling it up just as quickly by engaging in more PvP. I've praised Arc Raiders a lot since launch, perhaps above all else because it's finally an extraction shooter that's forgiving and welcoming for a wider audience, even as a fan of the genre's traditionally hardcore roots. However, there's a degree to which Arc Raiders' obsession with a fair playing field is its own worst enemy, and it unfortunately strikes deep into its core: the gear system just isn't all that exciting. The confusion I've seen from people wondering what they're supposed to do after they've unlocked everything and completed all the quests should have an easy answer: get better loot, kill things, eventually lose it, and do it all over again. But high-end loot isn't a satisfying and rewarding chase. Firstly, the abundance and strength of free loadouts mean there are a lot of players risking literally nothing in PvP match after match, while those bringing in gear have a high chance of losing it all. On the flip side, there's also no …",

It felt less exciting, and a shift away from what was unique about Two Point Museum—there's an abundance of Zoo-based management sims out there after all. As usual, I needn't have worried. The first look at its gameplay alleviated any concerns about it stepping away from its wonderfully absurd roots to become a facsimile of Zoo Tycoon, as tortoises waddle by with vegetable gardens on their back—complete with shed—and tropical birds look like exotic plants. If you felt short-changed by the lack of a specific museum for Fantasy Finds, Two Point Studios is rectifying this by going all out for its biggest DLC so far, including \"100% more lions\" and a new museum location: Silverbottom Park.

To be fair, while that's over $1,000 more expensive than you can find some other RTX 5090 cards going for, and $2,000 more than the Founders Edition RTX 5090's MSRP, it is also $3,000 cheaper than the gold-plated RTX 5090 Dhahab OC, which started retailing for about $7,000 back in May . There are levels to these things, I suppose. The new card's price tag isn't just down to its dashing good looks, which it does admittedly have in spades, and it's not only to do with its limited supply of 1,000 cards. It's also down to its buffed 800 W power draw. Given the default RTX 5090 pretty much maxes out the 12V-2x6 connector's max wattage, a second power connection is needed to get it up to 800 W. That's where the BTF connection comes in.

    "body": "The Communication Hideout quest in Arc Raiders has a few tricky steps, one of which involves locating a missing battery cell around the Red Tower, while another involves tracking down a terminal concealed around the outside of the building. On the plus side, though, this quest doesn't require you to extract anything, so you can bring a free loadout . On the whole, it's a pretty straightforward quest all centered in and around Red Tower, so here's how to complete it and overcome those trickier stages, like finding the missing battery cell and the antenna terminal. Find the missing battery cell and power up the generator The battery is located in a box to the northeast of Red Tower (Image credit: Embark Studios) First off, you'll need to head to the Red Tower location in the south of the Buried City, where you'll then be asked to \"Find the missing battery cell\". This is located in a metal box in the street to the northeast of Red Tower, marked on the map above. You'll find a yellow-marked metal box against the side of a boarded-up kiosk next to a palm tree—this resembles the boxes you've found previous quest items in. Simply interact with it to produce the missing battery cell. Imag…",

Speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens, Nowakowski said \"There was a lot of inspiration in what Baldur's Gate 3 did, but I think we're still sticking to what was in Witcher 3, Cyberpunk.

My melon-pult flings a watermelon across the screen where it collides with a zombie, knocking its head off. That's the body of a dead person that's just been decapitated. And it happens every few seconds! My lawn would be covered in human heads if they didn't magically disappear. Grisly. Watching my plants get eaten by zombies is also disturbing. My poor, brave tall-nut, weeping yet still defiant as zombies rip fistfulls of nutmeat from its body and shove them into their rotting mouths. Even replacing my ragged t-nuts with new ones is a bit horrifying: I don't think I'm healing them, I think I'm euthanizing them in favor of new recruits. Monstrous. And what happens to single-use plants like squashes and ice-shrooms when they're activated? They sacrifice themselves? Dying for the cause? This game is non-stop carnage even when you win.

Contra has had levels like this in the past, but in Neon Inferno, you're both run-and-gunning and gallery shooting simultaneously: hold down the right bumper, and you swap your aim between the background and foreground. You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre.

Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\". (Image credit: Rockstar) That single design, the post explains, appears to reference Merrill’s Marauders, a legendary World War 2 infiltration unit whose lineage now forms the backbone of the modern Ranger Regiment. From there, JohnCGaming traces the Rangers’ ev…",

I am, what scientists and scholars might call, a big fat crybaby. I'll cry at just about anything if you pair it with a mildly sad-sounding violin. Hell, even then I might not need that much convincing. Being moved by just about anything in life is an incredibly blursed lifestyle. Nothing quite gets me bawling like a good videogame, though. Crying alongside protagonists, crying for them. Sobbing for side characters, nameless NPCs, maybe even a creature minding its own business before being mercilessly mowed down by me/an enemy/some omnipotent god. Heck, I'll even cry out of pure joy or excitement for something that's about to happen. And almost every single time, it's thanks to the music that accompanies those moments.

I just had to exist with the knowledge that there was some sort of creature out there that scared my incredibly goth sister so much you couldn't even utter the name. As you can imagine, my child brain ran wild with theories of what it could look like from the vague descriptions she'd given which, in turn, petrified me. Until the day I remembered her terror and finally experienced Pyramid Head for myself. Don't get me wrong, Pyramid Head is a scary horror villain, however it's nowhere near what I was led to believe it would be.

But the game that has hooked me in more than any other this month isn't likely to come up in conversation. Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours. And I've still yet to actually beat it. As I mentioned, Sektori's basic formula is similar to Geometry Wars 3. You control a \"ship\" shaped like an arrow in a shapeshifting arena pro…",

The original Vermintide was a decent stab at Left 4 Dead -style cooperative action by developer Fatshark, but much like Valve's pioneering shooter, it has long been eclipsed by its superior sequel. Consequently, Fatshark has taken an interesting approach to celebrating a decade of rat-squashing, bringing one of Vermintide's \"most popular\" maps into Vermintide 2. Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\". There's also \"more than Just Skaven\" lurking in the surrounding woods—suggesting you'll encounter some Chaos horde…",

The move to make Zork open source is a combined project between Microsoft, the Xbox Team, and Activision, while Jason Scott, a digital archivist at the Internet Archive, was also involved. Code repositories for Zork , Zork 2 and Zork 3 already exist on Github, having been submitted anonymously several years back. In a blog explaining its decision to make Zork open source, Microsoft says that rather than create new repositories, it has \"officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories\" which \"add a clear MIT License and formally document the open-source grant.\" Microsoft also points out that the license related only to the source code, and \"does not include commercial packaging or marketing materials\".

But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts. Petrolheads can participate in three lap-based circuit races, three linear road sprints, and six time trials.
