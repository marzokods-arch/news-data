Though you might have assumed that you could just take the item to Forge Daughter to get it fixed up, you can actually repair it in three different locations, giving you three potential versions of the Silkshot tool that it grants you. This tool is effectively a silk gun, firing projectiles at enemies, but the nature of those projectiles changes depending on which repair method or vendor you pick. Below, I'll go through all three Silkshot options and where to find them, plus I'll explain which I think is the best. Remember, you can only choose one version of Silkshot , so decide which you'd prefer before rushing off to Forge Daughter. How to repair the Ruined Tool in Silksong You can find the Ruined Tool in Weavenest Murglin in Bilewater (Image credit: Team Cherry) You first find the Ruined Tool in Weavenest Murglin in the southeast of the Bilewater area and can then repair it in three possible locations to get the Silkshot tool—essentially a Silk gun you can use almost like a Silk Skill.

Just check out ewaste.fka.wtf . That website is hosted on the microcontroller from a disposable vape, and it's surprisingly snappy. Some disposable vapes come with a surprising amount of tech packed into them, including screens and microcontrollers. As BogdanTheGeek, the person who made the vape-powered site, says: \"I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB-C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as 'disposable'.\" The horsepower of these little devices might not be much, but it's enough to host a bona fide website.

Well, with his new gold medal (which you can see up-close on the Wiki page , and which wouldn't look out of place in The Witcher itself) Sapkowski is now among the most hallowed of those ranks.

The Old Hearts sees you heading to three previously uncharted areas, and finding the entrance to each is actually rather tricky. The Heart of the Woods, especially, has a somewhat nonsensical entrance you could theoretically spend hours trying to find. That, or you could check this guide and be on your merry way towards the area's challenging bosses instead. How to reach the Heart of the Woods in Silksong The entrance to the Heart of the Woods area is on the left side of the Grand Gate lift shaft you fell down at the start of Act 2 (Image credit: Team Cherry) The way to this location is a little unusual.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Gearbox) For the week of September 12 to September 19, Maurice's Black Market vending machine is located in Plungeford, in the north of Coastal Bonescape, Fadefields . You can find the vending machine on the balcony of the tallest building in the area. The Black Market machine resets every Friday at 12:00 am EDT / 5 am BST. The biggest change to the weekly Black Market in Borderlands 4 is that the inventory on offer is unique to …",

As a little crew of spacefaring avians, you're tasked with gathering a handful of resources like water and sulfur from some nearby asteroids. Land on one, build a launchpad, drop some extractors to gather what you need, and link the two via pipes. Sorted. There's no time pressure, and you can't go bankrupt—if you ever run out of money you can just wait until it ticks back up again, and you even get a little car you can use to drive around asteroids picking up chunks of bonus cash to speed things along. (Image credit: Toukana Interactive) Layers are gradually added—you start combining and transforming resources to get new ones, and then you're setting up networks moving resources between asteroids to get things where they're needed. But the production lines still feel simple and easy, and I was lulled into a cosy sense of security. It's what I expected from the new game from the developer of Dorfromantik. I spent many hours with that game's board game-like puzzle, free to pursue ruthless efficiency but never really encouraged to do any more than just enjoy the rustic little scenes my tiles created.

Those numbers put Borderlands 4 at #46 on the list of all-time highest Steam concurrent peaks , just below Elden Ring Nightreign, and Silksong all the way up at #17, sandwiched between Apex Legends and Path of Exile 2. I don't like to fixate too much on Steam concurrents as a measure of popularity, as they don't tell the whole story, but they are one of few direct windows into what gamers are doing that we have, and this particular figure underlines just how colossal of a success Silksong has been.

Before I explain how it works though, you should know that it requires fairly late-game unlocks to put together. I'd wait until you're several hours into Act 2 before attempting this. The heart of the build is the Architect Crest which has the unique ability to repair your tools on the fly. Normally, you have to rest at a bench to do that, but this Crest gives you the option to forgo healing yourself to replenish your tools in the middle of combat. Tools are extremely powerful in Silksong and no other Crest lets you spam them like this one. The only drawback is that you can't equip any of Hornet's high-damage skills with it, but the amount of tools you can fling out more than makes up for it. You can pretty much equip any tools you want, but Syrobe recommends the Tacks, Silkshot, and the Voltvessels. He adds in the Pollip Pouch so every hit applies …",

As the dust settles, we're now getting our first estimates for just how many copies Silksong has sold. In its game discovery newsletter , games industry analyst firm GameDiscoverCo estimates based on available data that Hollow Knight: Silksong has already sold more than 3.2 million copies on Steam. Additionally, GameDiscoverCo reckons it's been downloaded approximately 1.5 million times through Xbox Game Pass, though it's unclear how many of those downloads were distributed between console and PC. For an indie release from a relatively small production team, that's a phenomenal success, particularly when compared with other Metroidvanias. Silksong's in a genre with no shortage of enthusiasts, but Metroidvanias aren't what we'd typically consider as having mass market appeal. Comparing Steam sales numbers against other games released this year with the Metroidvania tag, GamesDiscoverCo says \"Silksong's dominance is striking.\" U…",

But I've been a fool: despite using the attack in multiple boss fights, I actually haven't been getting as much damage out of it as I could've. Thanks to a PSA video from Jason Mondal on YouTube, I only just learned how to use Thread Storm to its full potential. Instead of pressing or holding right bumper on a controller once to activate the ability, you can rapidly mash the button to extend its duration without using more silk, giving you more damage per cast. The only downside is that this leaves you vulnerable to a counterattack for longer, but that's kind of the basic tradeoff of Thread Storm already. My preferred deployment is at a diagonal, up and slightly to the side of a boss to get them in the AOE while having a good chance of avoiding any attacks. Against enemies who can be staggered by Thread Storm, though, there's practically no disadvantage to using its max duration⁠—this ability can be a huge help during any of those tricky wave fights.

The entire build revolves around throwing knives that cause your normal damage to become critical damage. You can find the \"Penetrator Augment - Damage\" stat on any Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife in the game and it'll work regardless of the item's level.

It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on.

Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4.

The studio's been spotted (by The GTA Base on X) counting its chickens before they've hatched in a recent job posting for a lead software engineer. \"With the continued growth of Grand Theft Auto Online and the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto 6,\" Rockstar prognosticates that \"the successful candidate will lead both the evolution and operation of the data platform supporting what will be the largest game launch in history, ensuring it scales to deliver an exceptional experience for millions of players worldwide.\" Now, look, don't get me wrong. Predicting that GTA 6 will be the biggest videogame ever feels a little like predicting the Sun will rise in the east and set in the west, but I can't help but find it amusing that Rockstar is willing to talk about it like it's already established fact a full seven months out from the game's release.

The next Ryder Cup will take place at the Bethpage Black Course in Farmingdale, New York. So, the pressure is on. Home team advantage is at play here, and a part of that is the intensity of the crowds.

One enlightening subject is writer and quest designer Mark Nelson, who was responsible for a chunk of Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, as well as fleshing out the starter village of Seyda Neen. He's the guy responsible for Tarhiel, the wizard who memorably falls out of the sky in front of you the moment you leave, for instance.

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more.
