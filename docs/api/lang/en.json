    "body": "Swedish pop icon Robyn will return to Australia in November 2026 for her first run of headline shows in the country in fourteen years. The tour marks Robyn’s first Australian performances since 2012, when she last visited the region during the Body Talk era, including an appearance at Parklife Festival. This time, the artist will play two arena shows: Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena on Nov. 21 and Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena on Nov. 24. The Australian dates arrive as part of Robyn’s first major global tour since 2019 and coincide with the rollout of her forthcoming album Sexistential , due March 27. The record follows 2018’s Honey and represents her first full-length release in eight years. Robyn recently previewed the project with singles “Talk To Me” and “Sexistential,” following earlier track “Dopamine.” In announcing the album last month, she described its emotional tone as a return inward after years of exploration. “It’s like a spaceship coming through the atmosphere at a really high speed and crash landing,” she said in a statement. “That’s how I felt — like I’d been searching too far out into space, and now I’m crashing back into myself.” Known for pairing club-ready production …",

I want to feel it. I want people to watch it and enjoy it.” Selecting the setlist for the halftime performance proved to be one of the biggest challenges. “That was tough,” he admitted. “Even for my shows on tour, it’s hard to pick 30 or 40 songs. So imagine for 30 minutes. It was very hard. The selection process was very intense.” Rather than focusing on hits alone, Bad Bunny said he approached the show as a storytelling exercise. “I had a vision about the story, the mood, and the feelings that I want to put on that show,” he explained. “I want people to feel happiness and joy.
