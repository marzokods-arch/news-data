    "body": "As Recording Academy voters pore over the 2026 nominations list before final-round voting closes on Jan. 5, they are sure to notice that the nominees for record and song of the year are nearly identical. Seven of the eight record of the year nominees are also up for song of the year. The only difference between the two lists is that Chappell Roan’s “The Subway” is nominated for record of the year but not song of the year, and HUNTR/X’s “Golden” is nominated for song of the year but not record of the year. Other than that, the lineups overlap exactly: Bad Bunny’s “DtMF,” Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild,” Doechii’s “Anxiety,” Billie Eilish’s “Wildflower,” Lady Gaga’s “Abracadabra,” Kendrick Lamar with SZA’s “luther” and Rosé &amp; Bruno Mars’ “APT.” It’s the first time in 11 years that there is just one difference in the lineups for record and song of the year. You probably know, but to refresh you: Record of the year honors a specific recording of a song; song of the year honors the song itself. Record of the year is awarded to the artist and producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) and mastering engineer(s), if other than the artist. Song of the year is awarded solely to t…",

Cris MJ, Las Filtradas (Sonar LLC) Cris MJ chose Christmas as the perfect moment to drop Las Filtradas , an 18-track LP that relies upon minimalist beats while blending reggaetón with trap textures. Opening with “Pensando Brígido,” produced by Reelian, the album leans on Autotuned vocals and straightforward street narratives to establish its sound. Focus track “Botellita de Champagne” is an explicit ode to seduction, fitting into reggaetón’s risqué traditions, while “Hoy Te Toca,” featuring FloyyMenor, brings a flirtatious vibe to the mix. Cris MJ nods to his global ambitions on “Subieron las Ventanas,” teaming up with Puerto Rican heavyweight Bryant Myers to deliver boastful, defiant verses over bass-heavy production. True to its title, Las Filtradas — his second album this year, and fourth overall — built online buzz ahead of its release due to unauthorized leaks. While the project offers a cohesive collection for longtime fans, it largely sticks to Cris MJ’s established formula. Still, the albu…",

The court held that the two tracks shared only holiday clichés and ordered Vance’s attorney, Gerard Fox , to repay Carey’s legal fees as a sanction for filing “frivolous” arguments.

Because the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket upon which they will launch is not yet at the launch pad, the crew boarded Orion inside NASA Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building, where engineers are conducting final preparations on the spacecraft, rocket, and ground systems. During the rehearsal, teams went through all the steps that will be taken on launch day, winding the clock down to just a few seconds before liftoff. Through the Artemis campaign, NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars, for the benefit of all.

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",
