    "body": "Sony has announced that Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon , which was initially slated for release this year before a negatively received beta saw it delayed, will still release by March 2026. Brilliantly, Sony announced this in the same financial report that saw it basically throw its hands up and tell investors, yeah, that Bungie acquisition didn't really work out . There are many more reasons for that than Marathon, of course: Destiny 2 is in a big slump , while the studio has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs , and its CEO recently departed . But the mood music around Marathon is not great and with Concord in the rear-view mirror, one of the biggest live service flops in the industry's history, you sense a certain caution in the Sony executive suite. Marathon was announced with a (fantastic) trailer in 2023, but was indefinitely delayed earlier this year after \"passionate\" feedback. There was also, for good measure, a plagiarism scandal . Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao now says the company is \"fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule\" which means by March 2026: \"We will assume that we will launch this within this [financial] year, and that is …",

    "body": "Once Upon a Katamari announced the first two DLCs during the State of Play Japan stream on November 11, and to say I'm excited is a complete understatement. Even though these DLCs won't add any crazy new levels for you to roll around, they're just as exciting. If you jumped at the opportunity to start customising your character with accessories like I did, then you'll be thrilled to hear this too. Both DLCs will add five remix tracks and ten accessories each to the game. The first will arrive this month, adding five Dance Dance Remixes to the game alongside its mystery accessories. And, outside of the DLC content, all players will receive a cosplay set for Saki Hanami from Idolm@ster, which is potentially one of the greatest outfits I've seen yet in Katamari. I hope this also means we can expect more cosplays in the future, as I'd probably sell my soul for a Miku outfit. With that said, this outfit in particular is only available for the Prince, so you won't be able to dress any cousin up in full cosplay. Again, I'm pretty hopeful this will change later down the line as well. However, the second DLC coming in winter will give every player a set of DJ accessories which aren't just …",

Some had fantastic teaser trailers, some have more Steam wishlists than ever believed possible, while yet more have flown under the radar of all but our most eagle-eyed writers and editors, and some are from fantastic developers who've already released our favourite games.

If you're bringing the wires with you, I'd suggest tucking them in a safe pocket rather than taking a free loadout , just in case you have to go again. Otherwise, here's how to find the Generator Room and complete Flickering Threat. Find the Generator Room and repair the generator First thing's first, you're going to need four wires to complete this quest , so I suggest stuffing them in a safe pocket to bring with you, or simply recycling items you find along the way to get them, though obviously the former is more reliable.

    "body": "I've developed what I can only describe as a begrudging respect for Meta's hardware output right now. I've bought almost every Meta headset to date, and unboxing the first one in the Summer of 2020 is definitely a highlight of my VR journey so far. However, Meta's dominance in the market is soured somewhat by Meta itself. Meta AI remains the unwanted present that just keeps on giving, the \" legendary misadventure \" of the metaverse is a multibillion-dollar digital eyesore, and, of course, it has laid off tens of thousands of employees in the process. And this all makes me feel that, frankly, Meta is too comfortable. The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S are fantastic bits of hardware, but the closest device I've found to its dominance is the Pico 4 Ultra . Even then, Pico's hardware isn't available in the US and mostly just apes Meta, with very similar specs. Even if the Pico 4 Ultra were to take off and steal back that oh-so coveted market share from Meta, Pico's parent company, Bytedance, is just as data hungry, making it perhaps not the competitor one would want. Valve is a multibillion-dollar company too, but it stays in its lane more and seems content as a corporate entity to just se…",

In the wake of the company's latest hardware trifecta, announced yesterday , Valve is saying exactly the same thing. In short, the kind of chips Valve would need to make a true Steam Deck 2 still aren't available and probably won't be until 2027. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Back in 2023, Steam Deck hardware specialist Yazan Aldehayyat said, \"I think for us to make a second version, we will be able to have a substantial performance improvement while sticking to a similar kind of power range and weight to battery life. And that's not going to happen next year or the year after that. It's probably going to be more than that.\" Two years on, Valve is still happy to say it plans a new second-gen Deck. But essentially, the same problem remains. \"We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that.

Designed in collaboration with Issey Miyake, a brand based around the works of a late fashion designer of the same name, the iPhone Pocket is, Apple proudly declares, \"born from the idea of creating an additional pocket\". Revolutionary stuff. It's also been inspired by the concept of \"a piece of cloth\", which is fairly obvious to see, as that's exactly what it looks like (via BBC News ). The long strap version has also been priced at $230 , a figure that has drawn much ire and ridicule from the online community. Quelle surprise, etc, etc. The iPhone pocket everybody. $230 for a cut up sock. Apple people will pay anything for anything as long as it’s Apple. pic.twitter.com/wRtQKBzoqt November 12, 2025 Some have made the comparison with wearing a sock around your neck , which in and of itself feels like something you might see on a runway near you as a bold new imagining of the paradigm of footwear. Or something. Of course, Apple and Issey Miyake have been keen to point out that it's not just a piece of cloth. It's made of various colours of…",

If you're out of the loop, Stella Montis is a brand-new map that releases whenever we've pooled enough materials together to complete this stage. While contributing to the community's efforts in unlocking the map is the main goal, of course, it's not selfish to consider the fact that you also earn Merits for donating materials. Merits are an event currency that you'll be able to spend on a new reward track in the next phase of the community event, once the Stella Montis map is actually available. Not only did these donations not put a single dent in my stash, but I also didn't even have to play the game; I just clicked 45 times on the main menu. The crucial part is that the maximum amount of Merits you can earn (during this phase, at least) is 900, so you'll have completed your personal contribution after donating 225 materials. In other words, just 45 clicks, or 46 if you're counting the button to open the event page. I imagine this is where most players still stop contributing to the event, unless they've got an overflowing stash and…",

According to Valve, it's simply plug and play. If you have a bunch of games installed on your Steam Deck's card and you plug that into the Steam Machine, voila, all your games are now available there. \"You can take your catalogue from your Steam Deck or from your Steam Machine, and they're fully interoperable, so you can plug it in here and just bring it along with you,\" Jeremy Selan, an engineer on the Steam Frame, says. All three devices support up to 2 TB of SDXC storage via the microSD card slot, and Valve tells me that game performance is good enough even from the compact storage medium. \"We think you get a really good experience with SD cards.

Although I never bought one myself, I briefly had the chance to use one about nine years ago and wasn't in the least bit surprised that the project failed. It was only when I got to try a Steam Deck for the first time that I realised Steam Machines weren't dead at all and now they're back again entirely. So what went wrong the first time, and will the new ones fare any better? To fully understand the significance of the Steam Machine's rebirth, you need to go back to the year 2012. This period is important because it's when Microsoft released Windows 8 , a version of the PC operating system that was supposed to be an OS for all devices, but mostly just succeeded at pissing people off. Developed over four years, Windows 8 wasn't just a mild tweak of Windows 7, with a fancy new GUI slapped on top.

Curiously, Steel Frontiers is confirmed for PC, Android, and iOS but not PS5, though as Guerilla Games' Jan-Bart van Beek mentions in the video embedded above, it has been \"built specifically for mobile\". It's also well worth noting that this NCSoft-developed project is distinct from Horizon Online Project, which is an online spin-off Guerilla Games itself is making. Based on the footage, Steel Frontiers looks pretty good for a mobile game, though that depends on whether you think the Horizon series in general looks good. There are few obvious compromises made when it comes to the equally lush and decrepit open world, and the mechanical beasties look as ornate as usual. Some loose things I can glean from the video footage: there are mounts, both flyable and grounded. You can leap from your mount onto a Tallnec…",

Dogs are great, and it's a scientifically proven fact that any game can be improved by a factor of 90% by simply adding a dog to it—and that rises to 99% when you can pet that dog. But how well do you know our loyal, four-legged friends? If you saw 10 different dogs from 10 different games, do you think you could tell me their names, or at least the games you know them from? In the quiz below, I'll show you a picture of a dog, and all you have to do is type in its name. To make things a bit easier, you can guess either the name of the dog or the name of the game . So, if you can't quite remember a dog's name, you can still make a guess about what game they're from. Sink your teeth into this quiz, and let us know how you did in the comments!",

So I don't want to put too many sort of preconceived expectations on how people will use this.\" The Valve Index is an accessory for a gaming PC. Valve sees the Steam Frame as both an accessory and a gaming PC. It's right to do so. The Steam Frame contains its own Arm-based processor and runs SteamOS to be able to play games without requiring a second PC. It's a great experience, too, as you can read in my Steam Frame hands-on . \"If you think about the Valve Index, awesome…",

    "body": "SanDisk has announced the world's smallest 1 TB USB Type-C drive, a title I can only assume comes with a tiny plaque and similarly-sized bottle of champagne. The SanDisk Extreme Fit USB-C flash drive looks to be a real tiddler of a USB device, so much so that SanDisk says you can leave it in the side of your laptop for \"everyday use and travel.\" I think you'll probably have to for safekeeping, as it looks small enough to be lost the second you pull it from the box. It's also not the fastest drive in the world, given its 400 MB/s top read speed for the 128 GB to 1 TB versions, but it's still a fair bit quicker than your average USB stick. Yes, it comes in a variety of capacities, although interestingly SanDisk is claiming the world's smallest crown for the 1 TB variant specifically. I can only presume that somewhere out there exists a low capacity drive no bigger than a USB Type-C connector itself, greedily holding on to the \"smallest USB Type-C drive that isn't 1 TB\" title. Anyway, something that strikes me about the overall design is how it sits slightly proudly over the top of a laptop bottom deck in the product photos. That's a much more resilient design than most USB sticks, w…",

If you're anything like me, your memory is probably one of despair and frustration. Designed by the most nefarious minds in engineering, they are the ultimate anti-climax generators, always seeming tantalisingly close to a payout and always stubbornly refusing to give one up. (Image credit: Doraccoon) On the one hand, Raccoin is a roguelike based on coin-pusher machines. But on the other, it's my emotional catharsis simulator. I can finally let those frustrating memories go—Raccoin's machines will let me win, and win spectacularly. The structure is simple—each round, I get a certain number of coin drops (which I can aim rather more precisely than with a real machine) and have to try and reach that round's target score. That score translates to prize tickets, and between rounds I can tip the odds in my favour by spending them on special coins, power-ups, and passive bonuses. It's a very simple thrill at first.

That's a big ol bold statement to open with, but the Orbital Pathfinder is unlike anything I've ever tested. I've been a part of this weird and wonderful PC gaming world for the better part of three decades at this point, and the one prevailing trend that continues to develop almost exponentially year-on-year is the PC gamer's desire to customize things to exactly how they want them to be. To what's right for them. It started with custom PCs, moved on to keyboards, and is now spilling over into almost every area imaginable in this humble little hobby of ours. This isn't the first time we've seen custom mice; ones with swappable plates and grips have existed before the Pathfinder, but no other comes even close to matching what Orbital provides with this setup. It's utterly astonishing. Is this the best wireless gaming mouse of 2025? Honestly? Probably. There are so many ways of customizing it, of tailoring it to exactly how you want it to function, that if it isn't perfect for you, you probably just hav…",

And just when you thought they couldn't get any more complex and intriguing, here comes Inverse Lithography Technology, or ILT, a weird and alien technology that promises to push chip design to yet higher levels of performance. ILT is not, strictly, new. But according to YouTube channel Asianometry , it is being used in revolutionary new ways by chip manufacturer TSMC and Nvidia, everyone's favourite $5 trillion graphics chip company. This is a complex story, but to précis the salient details, the use of extreme ultraviolet light to shrink down chip components to smaller proportions than ever before throws up some rather peculiar problems, leading to flaws when transferring the patterns contained in the lithography masks to the silicon wafers. In simple terms, it comes down to the way the EUV light diffracts and distorts as it passes through the various lenses, reflectors and apertures of the mind-boggling complex ASML lithography machines used by TSMC to manufacture the most advanced chips. Using conventional chip production techniques, these can't all be controlled and corr…",

There's more of a narrative going on in Anno 117 than your average city builder as well, which is a nice touch. Our Anno 117: Pax Romana review says, \"At times it borders on so friendly and non-threatening to your endeavours that you feel like you could leave it unattended for an hour and return to find everything absolutely fine.

In other words, SoftBank reported high profits and its share price climbed, then almost immediately dumped its Nvidia stocks, and its price dipped again. Nvidia's share price also dipped a little , too, after SoftBank shed stocks. SoftBank has already said it's attempting to position itself as \"the organiser of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era\", investing heavily into AI companies, for instance pledging a $40 billion investment into OpenAI earlier in the year.
