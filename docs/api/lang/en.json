The images show the phone in two colorways and reveal its front design as well as a few camera specifications. The device features a 12–71mm telephoto lens, a Sony LYTIA sensor, Dolby Vision support, and OIS. Renders of the so-called Motorola Edge 70 Ultra leaked earlier this month. However, those leaks came with a twist. Soon after the images were leaked, noted tipster Evan Blass claimed that the flagship handset, codenamed Urus, wouldn’t actually be part of the Edge lineup at launch. Instead, Motorola is reportedly positioning it as its first “Signature” device, supposedly a new premium tier for the brand.",

A new “Share network” toggle in Wi-Fi settings will let you decide if other users can automatically access a specific network without re-entering the password. Although currently in the Canary channel, this feature is expected to arrive in a future Android update, possibly the Android 16 QPR3 beta. Android allows you to create different user profiles, each with its own apps, files, and settings, enabling multiple people to share a single device. Although this feature is available on many Android phones , it sees the most use on tablets , which are commonly shared among family members. While most data doesn’t carry over between profiles, Wi-Fi credentials do, so users don’t have to re-enter the password for a network the device has already joined. This setup works well in most scenarios, but what if you don’t want every user on the device to access a specific Wi-Fi network? Currently, there is no way to choose which networks to share; once you connect, every other profile automatically gains access. Soon, however, Android will provide an…",

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off. Judging by the reaction, Google may have realized that it pushed things a bit too far, and now it appears that the company is preparing to dial it back.",

Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays.

The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports.

    "body": "One UI 8.5 (left) and iOS 26 Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Samsung’s One UI has always proudly sported its own personality. It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is redesigning Health Connect’s settings to place connected apps front and center while streamlining the overall menu layout. A new grouped view for “App access” will allow you to grant or deny permissions for entire data categories with a single tap. We also found evidence that Health Connect will soon support tracking for alcohol consumption and various medical symptoms. Android has dozens of fitness tracking tools , giving you a wealth of options for improving your health. Managing the data collected by these apps can be tough, however, which is why Google created Health Connect . This service aggregates all your health and fitness data in one central, secure place. It also simplifies sharing between apps, meaning developers don’t have to build their own data transfer tools. When Google launched Health Connect in 2022, it supported just over 40 data types across six categories. With the release of Android 16 , Google expanded the service to include yoga and meditation sessions (“Wellness”) as well as medical records like allergies, vaccinations, and lab results. Most recently, the Android 16 QPR2 update brought native step tracking support to Health Connect.",

Do Not Disturb is one of the most useful features our phones have, and often feels like the last line of defense against a world that wants us constantly assailed by notifications. But sometimes someone really, really needs to get in touch with us, so it’s good to know that we have options there, whether that’s designating contacts who can override DND, or recognizing repeat callers by their urgency. With the arrival of QPR2 earlier this month, Google announced another way it was giving us an option to punch through DND — and that’s finally starting to arrive now.
