    "body": "TL;DR The LineageOS team has released LineageOS 23.0, bringing Android 16 to over 100 different devices. This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

She was 79. People first reported Saturday (Oct. 11) that she died in California with loved ones, citing a family spokesperson. No other details were immediately available, and representatives for Keaton did not immediately respond to inquiries. The unexpected news was met with shock around the world. Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her “La-dee-da, la-dee-da” phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family. Her star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades thanks in part to a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Nancy Meyers.

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions. The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to import Pixel phones from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi. VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the feature that routes voice calls over a 4G LTE connection, a crucial function now that carriers worldwide are phasing out their 2G and 3G networks.

Before I talk about the new app that I’ve found, I should clarify what widget stacks are. On a Samsung phone, you can long-press a widget that’s already on your home screen and tap a Create stack button. This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there.

However, if there’s one product that has reshaped my views, it is NotebookLM, which has truly transformed how I consume information, for reasons other than the fact that it takes excessive prompt engineering out of the question. I have offloaded the unexciting aspects of learning to NotebookLM . That includes boring marketing or business newsletters, research papers, and video essays that I want to imbibe the best of, but without watching the idle chatter that those presenters engage in before getting to the point.

Instead of glue, the hardware is held together with screws and gaskets, for easy service. Everything from the battery to the display is replaceable. Of all Google’s new hardware this season, could the breakout star be a lowly smartwatch? We maybe weren’t expecting a lot from the Pixel Watch 4 early on, when it sounded like it might be just a minor refresh of past generations. But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables. But did the company actually make real progress there, or have those claims been a little oversold? According to the latest iFixit teardown, the Pixel Watch 4 very much delivers when it comes to being able to service its hardware.",

Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

I’m so glad I tried it, as it has added significant utility to my minimalist, productivity-focused home screen. Let me offer a brief tutorial if you aren’t familiar with Edge Panel or have never used a Samsung phone. The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface. These devices offered a gimmicky tapered screen edge where icons were placed, effectively turning the side of the phone’s screen into a secondary display packed with shortcuts. The idea was solid, but I never appreciated the execution.",

The projector offers 1080P resolution and runs Google TV for simple streaming access. While the speakers have a 20-hour battery, the projector itself requires an external power source. Portable projectors have long been a great space-saving alternative to a massive TV, but they often sacrifice audio quality to achieve their compact size. Anker’s Soundcore brand aims to solve that audio problem with its latest device, the Nebula P1 projector. The key feature of this projector is a pair of dual speakers that can be magnetically mounted to the projector or, crucially, detached and placed anywhere else in the room. This has the potential to bring you a wider soundstage and a more immersive sound experience, at least compared to most other projectors.",

According to iFixit’s teardown , every component of the glasses is sealed tight, with the entire frame glued and no easy way to replace the most obvious wear-out part: the battery. The teardown revealed a 960mWh battery, but the process of reaching it required specialist tools and a dose of luck to avoid damaging the delicate ribbon cable underneath. iFixit did say that “battery repair isn’t totally impossible here, provided you can get your hands on a replacement battery (which Meta hasn’t yet made available).”",

Update: October 9, 2025 (5:05 AM ET): Galaxy Techie on Twitter posted a series of screenshots highlighting this new call screening feature, which is apparently called Auto answer with AI . Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A security researcher found that Gemini is susceptible to ASCII smuggling attacks. These attacks hide malicious prompts in emails or calendar invites that LLMs can read when asked to summarize text. Google has dismissed the threat as a social engineering attack, placing the responsibility on the end user. Google tends to take the security of its users seriously, implementing a range of measures to keep its products safe to use. In fact, that’s part of the thought process behind the company’s crackdown on sideloading apps from unverified developers on Android. But it looks like the company isn’t too concerned about fixing an issue that makes Gemini susceptible to a troubling type of cyber threat. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
