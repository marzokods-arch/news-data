Over the past week, many Analogue 3D customers finally got their consoles after more than a year of waiting.

The ModRetro M64 was briefly revealed earlier this week, but today we got a full look at three transparent colorways: green, purple, and white. Each has four controller ports in the front, a power button, a menu dial, and an eject button at the back. On the back of the console, there’s a USB-C power port, HDMI out, two USB-C ports, and an SD card slot.",

The phone is expected to launch in global markets as the OnePlus 15R. It’s still possible that the OnePlus 15R will get a smaller battery and slower charging in some countries, though. OnePlus is gearing up to launch the OnePlus Ace 6T in China next week, and this phone is widely expected to be launched globally as the OnePlus 15R . We already know a few specs about both phones, and the company has now revealed battery details for the Ace 6T. OnePlus confirmed on Weibo that the OnePlus Ace 6T will have an 8,300mAh battery. This would be 1,000mAh larger than the OnePlus 15’s already gigantic battery (7,300mAh). OnePlus isn’t skimping on charging speeds, either, as the phone will have 100W wired charging. Check out the machine-translated screenshot below.",

First, it was RCS coming to the iPhone (in whatever watered-down form it arrived), and now, with Google making AirDrop interoperable , the walls between the two ecosystems suddenly don’t feel that high anymore. Google has done a mammoth job here. Getting AirDrop to play nice with Quick Share on Pixel 10s, while keeping security intact, is a big deal for the “community effect” iPhone users have always enjoyed. I know I won’t feel left out when people around me AirDrop videos they took of the stage at a concert just because I’m carrying a Pixel. While this is just a start, Google could take on a bunch of other areas and make them more seamless for both Android and iPhone users, bringing down the ecosystem walls brick by brick.",

Google’s Nano Banana Pro model , based on the Gemini 3 Pro Image, is one of the best tools available today for generating images. My colleague Mishaal Rahman tried out Nano Banana Pro and walked away impressed . The image model is great for creating and editing images, but you’ll still need to use another app to add annotations manually.

This mode offers the high throughput of 6GHz Wi-Fi while keeping the broad device compatibility of the 2.4GHz band. We expect this feature to arrive in an upcoming beta for the Android 16 QPR3 release. Android makes it easy to set up a mobile hotspot that most devices can connect to, but the default settings won’t give you the best speeds. That’s because, by default, Android creates a hotspot using the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, omitting the 6 GHz frequency supported by the newer Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 standards. This is understandable, as most devices can’t connect to 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks anyway. In some regions, namely the U.S., regulations also previously prohibited smartphones from creating 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspots. Thankfully, things are changing. Many devices now support 6 GHz Wi-Fi, and recent regulatory changes have opened up the use of this frequency for mobile hotspots in the U.S. As a result, Google recently pushed out an update to Pixel phones that unlocked the 6 GHz frequency for Wi-Fi hotspots. Pixel users can now create a 6 GHz Wi-Fi hotspot by going to Se…",

A new “don’t ask me again” checkbox allows the system to remember your preference for specific monitors. This streamlines the setup process, removing the need to dig through Settings to switch between mirroring and desktop modes. With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , certain Pixel phones gained more flexibility when connected to an external display. Rather than being restricted to simple screen mirroring, they can now project a desktop-like interface via Android’s new Desktop Mode . While Desktop Mode is great for productivity, you need a mouse and keyboard to really take advantage of it. Without these peripherals, controlling apps becomes difficult unless your external display has a touchscreen. In these cases, screen mirroring remains the better option, as it allows you to navigate using your phone while viewing content on the big screen.",

Circle Screen isn’t universally available yet. Google’s got a whole bunch of ways to search for stuff on your phone’s screen, from Google Lens to Circle to Search to Gemini. Earlier this year, we saw signs that two of those methods were growing closer together — and now, that project is finally rolling out broadly. Back in May , we got our first glimpse at how Circle to Search-like functionality would play out in Gemini. In that in-progress version of the feature, you could share a screenshot with Gemini, then circle portions of the screenshot to zero in on what you wanted to search for. The implementation rolling out now saves a step: after calling up Gemini, you just draw a circle around the part of your screen you want to share.",

NIRCam is Webb&#8217;s primary near-infrared imager, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations. Webb’s new view of the Red Spider Nebula reveals for the first time the full extent of the nebula’s outstretched lobes, which form the ‘legs’ of the spider. These lobes, shown in blue, are traced by light emitted from H2 molecules, which contain two hydrogen atoms bonded together. Stretching over the entirety of NIRCam’s field of view, these lobes are shown to be closed, bubble-like structures that each extend about 3 light-years. Outflowing gas from the center of the nebula has inflated these massive bubbles over thousands of years. Image credit: ESA/Webb, NASA &amp; CSA, J. H. Kastner (Rochester Institute of Technology)",

    "body": "NASA’s Lucy spacecraft captured images of the Moon’s surface on Oct 16, 2022, after flying by the Earth for its first of three gravity assists. Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.
