Negron died Monday (Feb. 2) at his home in Studio City, California, surrounded by family, according to a statement shared with Billboard. No immediate cause of death was announced, though the singer had been living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for decades and had recently battled heart failure. Born Charles Negron II on June 8, 1942, Negron grew up in the Bronx, where he sang in doo-wop groups before earning a basketball scholarship that brought him to Los Angeles. In 1967, he joined Danny Hutton and the late Cory Wells to form Three Dog Night, a vocal trio built around harmony-driven arrangements and carefully selected songs from outside writers — a strategy that helped make the group one of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1960s and early ’70s. Negron’s unmistakable lead vocals powered many of the band’s biggest hits, including “Joy to the World,” “One,” “Easy to Be Hard,” “Old Fashioned Love Song” and “The Show Must Go On.” Between 1969 and 1975, Three Dog Night scored three No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the era’s most domina…",

With its next desktop update, Firefox is finally offering a clear answer.

A new report now reveals how big a financial hit Disney’s sports broadcasting arm suffered due to the blackout. ESPN’s daily revenue loss was over $7 million per day, totaling a loss of over $110 million in operational revenue. Last year, in October, Google announced it was in negotiations with Disney to keep networks like ABC and ESPN on YouTube TV. As the two parties failed to reach an agreement before the then-existing licensing deal expired, a Disney media blackout ensued. Although both corporations were predicted to lose millions during the blackout, the situation wasn’t resolved until mid-November . Now we’re starting to learn just how big a financial impact that blackout had on Disney. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",

Initially advertised to ship with a 6,000mAh battery, the Pocket S Mini went into urgent production in order to ship before the Chinese New Year, which kicks off next week.

The company that has been the target of so many shipping complaints over the years just shadowdropped its latest Pocket S Mini handheld, skipping crowdfunding and pre-order periods altogether. Ok, so it’s not quite a complete shadowdrop, since the company has teased the Pocket S Mini since September , but now we finally have full specs and pricing. As the name implies, it has the same premium design language as the Pocket S, with an all-metal CNC frame and an all-glass front. The 4.2-inch 4:3 LCD panel appears to be the same one as the budget Pocket Air Mini (though the company promises it’s been improved), and it’s the ideal resolution for retro games.",

Concerns about privacy and AI scraping have already prompted my colleagues to seek more privacy-focused alternatives to Google Drive , and I can’t say I blame them. In fact, I’ve been spurred into joining them. Now, I must state that the easiest way to sidestep some AI concerns is to simply disable Google Drive’s AI features under Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Manage Workplace smart features and turn off the toggle. Simple enough. However, I am also constantly running afoul of Google Drive’s storage limits, and I refuse to spring for the expensive 2TB plan. While I’ve always been somewhat bothered by entrusting my documents to a third-party, AI nonsense is finally the push I need to move another one of my services out of the cloud and back under my control.",

The chief feature, though, is the new U1 UWB chip that is said to improve precision finding and propel the AirTag (2nd gen) far ahead of most of its competitors, many of which still don’t even have a UWB chip. However, in true Apple fashion, there are still lots of missing and potentially old-school features in the new tag, including the lack of cross-platform compatibility (because Apple, duh). This leaves the field of Bluetooth tracker competitors very much alive and blooming, and since I’ve been testing many of these trackers for the last 18 months, I’ll let you in on a secret: There are better trackers out there that work both on Android and iOS, and you should buy them instead.",

The last figures the company provided arrived in April of 2025. Android 16 already enjoys a 7.5% share, as of early December. With as much as we focus on Google’s latest Android fixes and improvements , looking at feature drops, Beta and Canary releases , and always obsessing about what’s happening next, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that much of the world is still operating on some pretty ancient Android releases. Every once in a while, though, we get a reminder of what this landscape really looks like as Google shares its updated platform distribution statics . It’s been the better part of year since we last got some fresh numbers, and now Google is once again updating its breakdown. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

I loved the idea of a phone that only took up half of my pocket, and I didn’t really care what companies did with their book-style foldables. Then, Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Fold 7 , and it quickly won me over. Sure, it was probably a little too expensive, but the hardware felt brilliant, and I finally figured out how to use a device like this as a regular phone, which kind of justified the whole experience. Now, though, I think Samsung has jumped the shark. Its Galaxy Z TriFold is as ambitious as its price is eye-watering, and I don’t see how anyone can justify buying one at launch. Here’s why I’d rather exercise a boatload of caution.",

Or maybe you set up that doorbell cam to let you know when deliveries arrive. For my money, though, one of the most impactful, easiest, and affordable upgrades can be a smart lock — no more carrying around keys (and worrying about losing them), simple to grant access to guests, and a nice, logged record of your comings and goings. Nuki has already been a great option there for users in Europe with its Smart Lock Ultra , and now it’s bringing its Smart Lock to the US. I tested it out for a few months to see how it holds up.",

More devices are getting the feature too, including the OnePlus 13R, 13s, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Pad Go 2. The latest Oxygen OS update also delivers extras, like the January 2026 security patch, 50MP photo editing on the 13s, and cleaner app organization. Last week, OnePlus made a significant move by introducing system-wide bypass charging on the OnePlus 13 with its first major 2026 Oxygen OS update. Now, as more devices receive the latest update, this useful feature is becoming available across the lineup, and it’s not just for gaming anymore. Bypass charging has been around for a while, but OnePlus is now making it helpful beyond gaming. Usually, phones charge the battery first and then use it to power the system, which can cause extra heat and wear. With bypass charging, your phone uses power straight from the charger during demanding tasks. This keeps the phone cooler and helps protect the battery.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify is working on making usernames editable. The music streaming platform technically already has usernames, but they are not at all user-friendly, and haven’t been for years. Currently, Spotify accounts receive automatically generated alphanumeric usernames, but users might soon be able to customize these. Spotify has been steadily transforming from a pure music-streaming service into a social media platform. Last year, the company introduced in-app Messages, and just yesterday, it quietly expanded that feature with group messaging support. Now, we’ve discovered evidence in the latest Spotify app that suggests the company may be preparing another long-requested upgrade: editable usernames.",
