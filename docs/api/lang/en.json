The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 43-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist.

If late-night smartphone use is interrupting your sleep, IKEA might have the perfect accessory to help you curb your doomscrolling. Yes, the Scandinavian furniture and home goods retailer is giving away an NFC-enabled phone bed as part of its “Phone Sleep Collection” promotion. It’s based on full-sized IKEA beds, and in classic IKEA fashion, requires self-assembly. IKEA UAE shared the product concept on YouTube, which is a miniature phone bed with an NFC chip inside (via MacRumors ). After downloading the IKEA app on iOS or Android, you’ll get a notification every time you place your phone on the bed. The app will secretly track how long your phone rests on the bed, with the goal being seven hours of rest.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile has closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed customers to claim discounts while paying bills early using ineligible methods, such as credit cards. Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole. However, it seems T-Mobile has caught on, and the free ride is now coming to an end for them. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It appears the OS may offer better gaming performance than Windows. Bazzite also wakes faster, offers more control, and may be slightly more energy-efficient. When the ROG Xbox Ally X launched, it received a lot of mixed reviews. While many found the hardware to be fine, it’s the software that has been the main sticking point. It features a lightweight version of Windows that comes with an Xbox full-screen experience , which is meant to optimize the operating system for handheld gaming. However, this experience doesn’t quite land the plane. To see if Windows is really what’s keeping this device from reaching its true potential, some creators tried installing a Steam-like OS based on Linux called Bazzite.

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority I’ve introduced GrapheneOS to a lot of friends and acquaintances, and I often see a mix of excitement and hesitation. Not because GrapheneOS doesn’t deliver on its promises, but because it practically requires you to buy Google’s Pixel line of smartphones to use it. For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR ChatGPT’s voice mode could soon be moved out of its full-screen UI to become part of chat conversations. This would enable voice mode to display rich content, such as weather, maps, and links, as the current voice mode UI does not currently support this functionality. OpenAI has been making waves with its AI products. It recently launched ChatGPT Atlas , a browser that takes legendary competitors like Chrome and surprisingly comes out on top. That’s not to say that the company has forgotten about ChatGPT, as we’ve spotted upcoming features like DMs and group chats in the pipeline for the Android app . With the growing popularity of Gemini Live , ChatGPT is also working to enhance its voice mode, and it may soon introduce rich content to make it easier to follow along.

There shouldn’t be anything surprising about this, right? Well, it isn’t. What is surprising is the fact that Google announced its Gemini integration in Chrome more than a month ago, and I still don’t have access to it. The reason is simple: I live in France, not the US. And Google has decided that Chrome’s Gemini integration is a privilege only Americans get to try, thus locking out the rest of the world. Meanwhile, OpenAI has an “everybody welcome” approach, with no georestrictions on its Atlas browser.",

The automaker will integrate Google’s Gemini AI into its vehicles starting in 2026, offering a smarter, conversational assistant. Gemini will be available as an over-the-air update via the Play Store for OnStar-equipped vehicles (2015 and newer). GM will also test other AI models from firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, while keeping user data private. General Motors is taking another major step away from smartphone projection systems. Having previously dropped support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay across its EVs, the automaker has now confirmed that it will also ditch support for these technologies in its future gas-powered models. Instead, the company is developing a centralized computing platform that will serve as the backbone of its next-generation in-car software. At the heart of this system will be Google’s Gemini.",

It’s got impressive hardware, capable specs, and powerful software with Android XR. But at the end of the day, the Galaxy XR is still very expensive. The headset itself costs $1,800, and if you buy the controllers and carrying case, you’re looking at an additional $500 .",

The Samsung Galaxy S25 series launched in January, much like the Galaxy S24 series last year. It stands to reason that the Galaxy S26 phones will launch in January 2026.
