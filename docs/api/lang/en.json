    "body": "Call it the calm before the Taylor Swift storm. The first three quarters of this year — which span Dec. 31, 2024, through Oct. 2, 2025 — effectively function as a report card for the record business before the inevitable takeover of the superstar’s Life of a Showgirl album, which came out Friday (Oct. 3). The album immediately sold 2.7 million copies on its first day, which would already make it the second-biggest album of the year to date — but that’s not under discussion just yet.&nbsp; Even without the new Swift release, her label home REPUBLIC — which encompasses Republic Records, Island Records, Mercury Records, Big Loud and indie distributor Imperial — is still leading the pack for the year so far, with a 13.60% three-quarter current market share, powered by huge albums from Morgan Wallen, Sabrina Carpenter and The Weeknd, among others. It’s a jump from the industry-leading 12.69% current share Republic enjoyed at midyear, though down from the Swift-powered 15.21% it posted through three quarters in 2024, when her The Tortured Poets Department album spent 17 of its eventual 19 weeks atop the Billboard 200.&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Elliot Grainge Talks First Year As CEO of Atlanti…",

At the 600-capacity venue in Camden, the singer performed his iconic debut Life Thru A Lens in its entirety, before airing tracks from his upcoming album Britpop (due Feb. 6). Those in attendance were required to put their phones in Yondr pouches, to avoid new songs being filmed and leaked online. The show was initially slated to coincide with the release of Britpop , though the record had recently been pushed back due to “scheduling issues.” Towards the end of the night, Williams confirmed that this was to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift’s The Life Of A Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination, which will likely continue over the coming month. If Britpop reaches the summit next year, Williams will secure his 16th U.K. No.1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart , breaking a tie with The Beatles in the all-time rankings. “We’re all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f&#8211;king is, you can’t compete with that…",
