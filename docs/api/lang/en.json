This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence. We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements. Strava also wants Garmin to stop selling products that may utilize these patents, which would include a slew of its fitness watches, cycling computers, and the Garmin Connect app. The lawsuit, first reported by fitness industry veteran DC Rainmaker , focuses on two primary features utilized by both companies: segments and heatmaps. Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route. Breaking down longer routes encourages users to hit more manageable targets across a more extended training session or race. Heatmaps, meanwhile, display areas and routes that users traffic heavily, effectively highlighting popular training areas. This is an excellent…",

    "body": "TL;DR Anker brand eufy solicited its camera users to submit footage of crime to help train its AI systems. Users could get $2 per approved clip, maxing out at $40 per camera. If they didn’t have enough crime happening around them, eufy encouraged users to film themselves pretending to be package thieves. It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models. And this week we’re learning about a clever way one company looked to crowdsource an effort like that — even if it cut a few corners along the way.

The new system requires Android to check if a developer is verified, which in some cases will necessitate an active internet connection during installation. Hobbyist developers can get a free account but will face strict distribution limits, requiring them to manually authorize each device installing their app. Back in August, Google made an announcement that shocked Android enthusiasts and privacy advocates: Starting next year, Android will block the installation of apps from unverified developers . This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay. The company also shared new details about how its developer verification requirements will be enforced, including that, in some cases, Android will require an active network connection to sideload apps.

The option isn’t terribly obvious, nested under Settings in Google Calendar’s side panel menu.

Originally, the plan required constant location sharing, but that requirement has now been removed. Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

For example, a recent leak revealed Samsung could give app icons a 3D appearance . Another leak suggests the brand is working on family group functionality . Now it appears the tech giant plans to expand a feature that was previously only available in China. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The mod, although bulky and aesthetically unappealing, significantly improves the phone’s sustained performance beyond what Apple has already achieved with the move to vapor chambers. The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs. But what if you wanted even better performance with even more heat dissipation and cooling? We’ve seen a few crazy cooling mods for phones, and this latest one attaches a bunch of SSD heatsinks onto the back of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

Satellite connectivity is restricted to select optimized apps such as WhatsApp, X, AccuWeather, AllTrails, and T-Life, with no support for full web browsing. While the service works reliably once connected, our own testing shows that establishing a satellite connection can often be difficult in some cases. T-Mobile officially launched its T-Satellite service earlier this summer, which brings satellite texting to select T-Mobile plans or to AT&amp;T, Verizon, and prepaid customers as a stand-alone option.

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up.

The company is also launching the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection in four colors: Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight. The Oura app is also gaining new features, including multi-ring support, which enables users to switch between multiple Oura devices on a single account. Oura just addressed one of the biggest gripes about its smart rings : charging on the go. The company has unveiled a new portable charging case capable of storing up to five full charges. This update helps Oura catch up in a space where rivals have a head start. Many rings, including RingConn’s and the Samsung Galaxy Ring, already offer portable charging cases, giving the devices a practical edge. By adding its own, Oura finally regains ground in one of the few areas competitors had pulled ahead.",

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
