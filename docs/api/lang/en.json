We also get a look at the S26 Edge, and this render lines up with a previous image. We got a first look at the Galaxy S26 Edge late last week, showing a tweaked design compared to the Galaxy S25 Edge . Now, a different source has revealed renders apparently showing all three Galaxy S26 series models. SmartPrix posted renders that purportedly show the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra . Starting with the Edge model, this design seems broadly in line with the earlier leaked renders. That means two vertically stacked rear cameras in a housing that spans almost the full width of the phone.",

Hosted by LL COOL J, the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards were one of the best VMAs in recent memory, a smart mix of newcomers who brought their A-game (and inventive visuals) and veterans who demonstrated why they’ve lasted in the game so long. Of the latter category, each one received some sort of Moon Person trophy during the three-hour telecast, with Mariah Carey receiving the Video Vanguard Award, Ricky Martin collecting the Latin Icon Award and Busta Rhymes getting the Rock the Bells Visionary Award.

For starters, it makes it easy to hot swap batteries on the go, so you can carry multiple and switch them if your phone dies mid-day. Also, batteries degrade over time, and today’s standard solution is to take them to a professional to replace them. With removable batteries, this process is as simple as ordering a new battery and sticking it into the phone yourself.",

Gemini didn’t have an equivalent to this, and despite having the paid subscription, I had to go to ChatGPT for that. We’ve known for a while, though, that incognito or temporary chats were coming to Gemini , and they’re finally here. They’re perfect for my needs, so I have started using them nearly daily. Here’s how they work and where and when I’m using them.",

But while the on-device LLM can do a lot, when it comes to heavy lifting, Google wants you to pop over into the Gemini app. More specifically, Gemini Pro . And to drive that point further, Google bundles in a free year of the Gemini AI Pro plan with the phone. The perk is designed to funnel you into recurring payments, and storage is the bait. In fact, I’d go as far as saying that the free year of Gemini Pro and 2TB of cloud storage are a key part of Google’s marketing to make the phone appear like a bargain. Two terabytes of cloud storage, access to Google’s best AI features, including Deep Research with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Initially, it was mostly curiosity and tinkering. That changed over time. Today, self-hosting for me is equal parts habit, convenience, and once-in-a-while stubbornness to stick with open-source solutions. But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

Starting next year, if a developer chooses not to verify their identity, Android will prevent their apps from being installed on certified devices (ie. devices with Google Mobile Services). This news sent shockwaves through the enthusiast community, with many criticizing Google for transforming Android into an iOS-like walled garden . Google claims its goal is to prevent bad actors from distributing malicious software under a cloak of anonymity. However, many believe the company has an ulterior motive, such as killing emulation on Android or hindering Android-based e-readers . In response, Sameer Samat, President of the Android Ecosystem at Google, said , “Sideloading is fundamental to Android, and it’s not going anywhere.” He added that the company’s new requirements aren’t designed to limit choice but rather to “make sure that if you download an app from a developer, regardless of where you get it, it’s actually from them.”",

My Maps is an obscure but powerful tool for creating personalized maps. Users can command various mapping features, including pinning custom markers on places, adding notes and images, routing info to and from multiple points, KML and GPX info, and layering all this data onto existing map visualizations. In short, My Maps allows users to bend Google’s mapping products to their will in impressive ways. Sounds great, right?

With the arrival of the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra , you might be wondering whether now is finally the right time to replace your aging Galaxy tablet. The answer here isn’t so cut and dry.

Lithium-ion batteries have been an utter game-changer for mobile devices, making possible everything from our smartphones to practical electric cars. But for all the power they can offer, their construction comes at a perilous disadvantage: It’s far too easy to damage one, and that risks the battery becoming a serious fire hazard. One of the best solutions we’ve come up with for fixing that problem is replacing the liquid electrolyte that mobilizes the charge in these cells with a mostly solid alternative: so-called solid-state batteries . Not only does that kind of design improve power density (so smaller batteries can hold more charge), but it also wildly improves durability — and resistance to catastrophic failure.",

However, when Google announced that the Android 16 QPR1 beta was ready for older Pixels, I let my curiosity get the better of me. I wondered what features I would get and which wouldn’t be ready yet. So, I did what only a tech reviewer can: I loaded Android 16 on my Pixel 9 Pro XL to see if it could match my Pixel 10 Pro XL. Here’s what I found out along the way.",

This partnership spawned Hasselblad-branded OnePlus flagship phones all the way until the OnePlus 13 . Now, the smartphone maker has confirmed that this tie-up is over. OnePlus co-founder Pete Lau noted in an official blog post that the company’s “planned chapter” with Hasselblad was now complete after five years. So what’s next?",

This bug is technically different, but the end result is the same. Google’s Pixel lineup has an unfortunate history of being unable to make 911 calls, a statement that doesn’t incite confidence at all. Reports first emerged in 2021 about Pixels being unable to connect to 911, and the issue was traced to a Microsoft Teams bug and fixed in 2022. More 911 call failure reports emerged in 2023 on Pixels, but Google never acknowledged the problem or publicly issued a fix. It seems even the Pixel 10 series cannot make 911 calls reliably, and that’s frankly scary at this point. Reddit user YellowWidget had to call 911 for an emergency. Unlike previous Pixels, the call went through. However, the user only heard what they describe as “garbled beeps, shrill electronic screeches, and the occasional ghost of a human word buried in the noise.” The user tried four times, but faced the same issue.…",

Under the hood, it runs on an octa-core processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a big jump from the 1GB RAM and 16GB storage you’ll find on most e-readers like a Kindle or Kobo.

From there, the spacecraft will travel together to their destination at the first Earth-Sun Lagrange point (L1), around one million miles from Earth toward the Sun.

The Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station supports full 25W Qi2.2 charging for your Pixel 10 Pro XL. For mobile needs, the Prime Power Bank charges not one, but two laptops at 140W a piece. Keeping our devices powered is the sort of modern-day chore that too many of us tolerate without properly considering all our options, making do with whatever charger we have laying around. That’s a shame, because accessory manufacturers like Anker have been crafting some increasingly advanced solutions, looking to satisfy our charging needs with speed, flexibility, and convenience. This week at IFA 2025, the company is sharing its latest lineup, including some models ideal for your new Pixel 10 phone. Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station",

Now that Stadia is dead and Xbox Cloud Gaming hasn’t made any significant improvements in years, the world seems to have shifted focus to gaming handhelds. But there’s a unique category that straddles the line between both. These handhelds are designed for game streaming rather than native play, which has advantages and disadvantages. The Abxylute One Pro is the latest entry in this category, and after testing it for a few weeks, I can confidently say it’s the best so far.",
