It ranked second behind Morgan Wallen ’s I’m the Problem for five weeks, behind Stray Kids &#8216; debuting Karma for one and behind Sabrina Carpenter &#8216;s debuting Man&#8217;s Best Friend for one. By hitting No. 1, we can remove KPop Demon Hunters from our list of albums that spent seven or more weeks in the runner-up spot without going all the way. We did include a parenthetical disclaimer that this could happen: “(Of course, it’s possible that&nbsp; KPop &nbsp;will make it to No. 1 eventually. No one would bet against the pop-culture juggernaut at this point.)” The list, which covers the entire history of the Billboard 200, from March 1956 to the present, is still valid &#8212; just one entry shorter. If you missed it last week, you have another chance to read it this week. PREVIOUSLY (Sept. 8): The artists with albums that logged seven or more weeks at No. 2 without reaching No. 1 are a varied bunch, running the gamut from mellow instrumentalist Kenny G to English glam metal band Whitesnake .
