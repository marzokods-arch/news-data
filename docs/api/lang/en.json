    "body": "The New York Times has published new details about a purported cyberattack that unnamed US officials claim plunged parts of Venezuela into darkness in the lead-up to the capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the US Cyber Command was involved. Got more details? “Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT reported .

    "body": "This post contains some mild spoilers, mostly from the beginning of the first episode. Today is a good day to watch television. That's because the first two episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It's set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you'll have to watch Discovery's final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy. That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child.

The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon's fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA's commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: \"It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back.\" Read full article Comments",

Trump declared early in his second term that independent agencies like the FTC may no longer operate independently from the White House, and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has backed Trump's claim of authority over historically independent agencies. The Supreme Court appears likely to approve Trump's firing of an FTC Democrat, giving him expanded power over the agency. The letter , led by Warren and other lawmakers, was sent to Ferguson. \"We write today regarding questions about false advertising and deceptive practices by Trump Mobile, and to seek information on how the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) intends to address any potential violations of consumer protection law given the inherent conflicts of interest presented by the company’s relationship to President Donald Trump,\" the letter said.

    "body": "Last week, news about the adoption rates for Apple's iOS 26 update started making the rounds. The new update, these reports claim , was being installed at dramatically lower rates than past iOS updates. And while we can't infer anything about why people might choose not to install iOS 26, the conclusion being jumped to is that iPhone users are simply desperate to avoid the redesigned Liquid Glass user interface. The numbers do, in fact, look bad: Statcounter data for January suggests that the various versions of iOS 26 are running on just 16.6 percent of all devices, compared to around 70 percent for the various versions of iOS 18. The iOS 18.7 update alone—released at the same time as iOS 26.0 in September for people who wanted the security patches but weren't ready to step up to a brand-new OS—appears to be running on nearly one-third of all iOS devices. Those original reports were picked up and repeated because they tell a potentially interesting story of the \"huge if true\" variety: that users' aversion to the Liquid Glass design is so intense and widespread that it's actively keeping users away from the operating system. But after examining our own traffic numbers, as well as …",

    "body": "Pairing Bluetooth devices can be a pain, but Google Fast Pair makes it almost seamless. Unfortunately, it may also leave your headphones vulnerable to remote hacking. A team of security researchers from Belgium’s KU Leuven University has revealed a vulnerability dubbed WhisperPair that allows an attacker to hijack Fast Pair-enabled devices to spy on the owner. Fast Pair is widely used, and your device may be vulnerable even if you've never used a Google product. The bug affects more than a dozen devices from 10 manufacturers, including Sony, Nothing, JBL, OnePlus, and Google itself. Google has acknowledged the flaw and notified its partners of the danger, but it's up to these individual companies to create patches for their accessories. A full list of vulnerable devices is available on the project's website . The researchers say that it takes only a moment to gain control of a vulnerable Fast Pair device (a median of just 10 seconds) at ranges up to 14 meters. That's near the limit of the Bluetooth protocol and far enough that the target wouldn't notice anyone skulking around while they hack headphones. Read full article Comments",

While the specific reason for the \"Bully Online\" takedown hasn't been publicly discussed, a message posted by the developers to the project's now-defunct Discord server clarifies that \"this was not something we wanted.\" The Bully Online mod was spearheaded by Swegta, a Rockstar-focused YouTuber who formally announced the project in October as a mod that \"allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more.\" At the time of the announcement, Swegta said the mod was \"a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time\" and that early access in December would be limited to those who contributed at least $8 to a Ko-Fi account. When December actually rolled around, though, a message on Swegta.com ( archived ) suggested that the mod was being released freely as an open source project, with a registration page ( archived ) offering new accounts to anyone.

While these same companies previously scraped Wikipedia without permission, the deals mean that most major AI developers have now signed on to the foundation's Wikimedia Enterprise program, a commercial subsidiary that sells API access to Wikipedia's 65 million articles at higher speeds and volumes than the free public APIs provide. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals. The new partners join Google, which signed a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media. The revenue helps offset infrastructure costs for the nonprofit, which otherwise relies on small public donations while watching its content become a staple of training data for AI models.

Italians love their cars, and they revealed a clear preference for internal combustion engines over the next four days and over 1,200 km of driving. But plenty of other spectators smiled and waved, and some even did a double-take at seeing an electric vehicle amid the sea of modern Ferraris and world-class vintage racers taking on this modern regulation rally. I flew to Italy to join the Mille Miglia “Green,” which , for the past five years, has sought to raise awareness of sustainability and electric cars amid this famous (some might say infamous) race . And despite mixed reactions from the Italian crowds, our Polestar 3 performed quite well as it traced a historical route from Brescia to Rome and back.

(Itself a newly created town that takes its name from a term popularized by Star Trek .) Neither Musk nor Hegseth seemed to recall that the “Arsenal of Freedom” phrase—at least in the context of Star Trek —is also the title of a 1988 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

    "body": "A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of 434 cases , with 409 people currently in quarantine. Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported 124 more cases since last Friday, which had 99 new cases since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to 211 cases . With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Sometimes, though, you just want an excuse to shoot a bunch of weird little guys in weird little spaces. Don't get too close, now... they do bite. Credit: Oddcorp For those times, there is Oddcore , a new Early Access, roguelike boomer shooter that is a stark contrast to the more sprawling self-serious shooters out there.
