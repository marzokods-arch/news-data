    "body": "Pierce the Veil leads Billboard ’s Alternative Airplay chart for a second time, lifting a spot to No. 1 on the Nov. 15-dated survey with “So Far So Fake.” The veteran rockers from San Diego previously led with “Emergency Contact” for a week in August 2023. “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake” are both on the same album, 2023’s The Jaws of Life . So why the two-plus-year gap between Alternative Airplay reigns? While not initially a promoted single, “So Far So Fake” was serviced to radio this summer after it went viral on shortform video platforms such as TikTok, spurred by a dance challenge set mostly to its instrumental break. Boosted by that buzz, “So Far So Fake” debuted on the multimetric Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart in August, eventually rising to No. 8 later that month. It also became the band’s first Billboard Hot 100 entry, reaching No. 64. In between “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake,” Pierce the Veil made Alternative Airplay once via its No. 27-peaking cover of Radiohead ’s “Karma Police” in June 2024. The band’s only other charter, “Circles,” hit No. 31 in 2016. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock &amp; Alternative Airplay chart, “So Far So Fa…",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Rumors suggest Verizon will announce layoffs and store closures around November 20, though details remain unconfirmed. The company reportedly plans to shut down less-profitable stores and cut staff across remaining locations, while expanding AI automation to fill the gaps. It’s unclear if other big changes will be announced around this time, though it’s possible that there’s more to this coming shift than just layoffs. Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about? I decided to dig into the online chatter and speak with a few trusted sources familiar with Verizon’s retail bu…",

    "body": "The easy thing for Rosalía would have been to follow up 2022’s successful Motomami , which placed her on the brink of superstardom, with a quick album that walked that same path: Songs that treaded the line between her flamenco Spanish roots and Latin and reggaetón influences. It was a formula that yielded hits like “Despechá,” Rosalía’s take on merengue, and “La Fama,” her take on bachata alongside The Weeknd. The set provided an unlikely segue from her stunning but niche-appealing El Mal Querer , to a broad audience who embraced Rosalía and her sound with cult-like passion. It stands to reason, then, that something along those lines would follow in quick succession. Instead, fans waited for two and a half years for LUX , an album that not only breaks parameters for Rosalía, but for the musical landscape as a whole. Recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, it’s an ambitious, complex, sprawling orchestral and operatic ouvre of 18 tracks, performed in 13 different languages, where Rosalía pushes her vocal prowess into untested waters. This isn’t your tried-and-done collection of pop songs set to symphonic arrangements, but rather a new take on pop (or is it classical?) that tes…",

His early recordings from that period — many featured on the just-released The Bootleg Series Volume 18: Through the Open Window, 1956-1963 — reveal a young artist still finding his voice, often mimicking the melodies and vocal styles of his heroes. Within a few months, Dylan would go through a transformation. The young singer-songwriter became an interpreter of others’ works, imbuing them with a unique character missing on earlier recordings. “The story of Volume 18 is Bob Dylan becoming Bob Dylan,” Sean Wilentz tells Billboard ’s Behind the Setlist podcast. Wilentz, author of the 2010 book Dylan in America , wrote Volume 18 &#8216;s detailed, often fascinating 125-page liner notes that provides historical context for the expansive eight-CD set. “It&#8217;s about his coming of age, his maturation — first as a performer and then as a songwriter — to become the person that we think of [today].” With Dylan surrounded by folk, blues, jazz and comedians such as Lenny Bruce, his artistic growth began immediately upon arriving…",

This week, things are getting even better: the singer/songwriter is set to make his debut on Saturday Night Live this weekend, and just today (Nov. 7) received a Grammy nomination in the coveted best new artist category.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR There were thousands of reports of YouTube being down earlier today. It turns out that YouTube is working fine. The problem is that the platform rolled out a big anti-ad blocker update. YouTube has long been at war with ad blockers, implementing various measures to get users to turn off their extensions. As a result, we occasionally see some users report that an ad blocker has stopped working on the website. This time, however, it appears that YouTube has rolled out a big update that made the website unusable for a large number of viewers who have their ad blockers enabled.

Turns out, you might not have to feel so guilty about that final scroll after all. As reported by Gizmodo , a new study titled The Complex Association Between Bedtime Screen Use and Adult Sleep Health found no clear link between nightly screen use and poor sleep among adults. In fact, both occasional and regular bedtime screen users reported better overall sleep health than those who used their phones moderately.",

    "body": "TL;DR Play Store reviews can be a useful resource for learning about apps, but they lack a search tool. You can currently filter reviews by score, date, or even specific topics, but you can’t add new topics yourself. It’s not yet functional, but some new code strings in the Play Store app suggest that Google’s working on a review search tool. Reviews have to be one of the most frustrating-to-navigate components of life online — one that we nonetheless find ourselves returning to time and time again. When you don’t know exactly what the best option for you is just yet, a good user review can really be illuminating. But finding that good one can sometimes require trudging through screens of low-quality submissions, AI slop, and even the work of paid shills. If you’re looking for some help finding the one review that really speaks to your needs, the Google Play Store appears to be working on a tool that might be right up your alley.

With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded .

    "body": "Credit: Prakhar Khanna / Android Authority With Gemini slowly but finally rolling out to Google’s smart speakers and displays, I’ve found myself filled with renewed optimism for my stack of devices. The search giant has stripped the platform of countless features over the past couple of years, and even some basic voice commands have failed to function like they once did. I’m not alone — hundreds of users have voiced the same complaint about Google Home across social media. Luckily, Gemini looks like it’s on track to revive Google Home’s usefulness but I’m equally concerned that it will introduce problems of its own. Given that I already have Google’s AI Pro subscription , I’m also looking forward to using Gemini Live — the two-way voice conversation feature that won’t require a wakeword every single time. However, after extensively using it on my phone, my excitement levels for the feature’s expansion have been significantly dampened.",

The expanded limit appears to be rolling out in the latest version of the app. Pinning keeps important chats visible, but if you’ve got 20 pinned, it might be time to reply to a few. Sometimes you get one of those texts that you don’t want to reply to right away, but also don’t want to forget about entirely as more messages arrive. That’s where pinned conversations come in handy, keeping your most important threads at the top of your inbox so they don’t get buried under new ones. Google Messages has long offered the pinned conversations feature, but now it’s turning it up to 11 — or, more accurately, to 20. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update.

Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual.

As part of the agreement, Google plans to make sweeping changes to Android, which will be implemented in a future version of next year’s Android 17 release. The company is developing a new system that will allow users to easily install third-party app stores, reducing the friction of getting apps from outside of Google Play. This timing is notable, as next year is also when Android’s new developer verification requirements will go into effect. Beginning in September 2026, Android will block users from installing apps made by unverified developers. Although Google says that sideloading isn’t going anywhere, some critics are concerned this change will kill alternative app stores like F-Droid .

I knew that I wanted Android to copy the feature, and I was pleased to see Samsung do so with One UI 7. Google has finally brought its version, called Live Updates, to Android 16 , but the execution leaves a lot to be desired, and Samsung’s implementation is something I’ve missed during my time with the Pixel 10 Pro. Thankfully, a third-party app has gone a long way to solve that issue for me. What Google is missing Live Updates show you information from ongoing notifications in a small pill to the side of your status bar that can be expanded when tapped on. Google doesn’t allow media playback , ongoing timers, and a host of other notification types to show here, whereas Samsung and other OEMs do. As you can see in the image above, Samsung’s Now Bar can provide quick access to media controls, and that expanded functionality extends to timers and stopwatches, too.",

This would be a significant increase in charging speed, as the current 45W fast charging solution drops off quickly. We don’t expect many year-on-year upgrades on Samsung Galaxy S flagships beyond the SoC changes, but there’s one rumor that has everyone excited. Samsung has been rumored to finally (FINALLY!) bring faster charging to the Galaxy S26 Ultra , bumping it up from 45W to 60W charging.

Facing challenges in developing a conversational AI chatbot over the past several months, Apple reportedly considered partnering with other AI companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, and was later believed to have chosen a partner .

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

New features include same-day screen repairs, more claims, added perks like McAfee and Scam Shield, and more. Last night, US Mobile announced plans for its new insurance service , which will officially launch next week under the name US Mobile Protect. Hot on its heels, Metro by T-Mobile has unveiled a new insurance program of its own. Unlike US Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile already offered insurance through its older Premium Handset Protection (PHP) program, provided in partnership with Assurant and starting at $5 per month. T-Mobile hasn’t officially confirmed its new insurance partner this time, but the rebrand signals a major change.",

The nickname stuck after the model went viral, prompting Google to adopt it. As the name caught on, Google used banana icons in the Gemini app to signpost the feature. If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

The message warns that if you don’t switch to an eligible plan or cancel the DashPass subscription, you’ll automatically be charged $96 per year plus tax until you cancel. These users claim that they have made no changes to their plans. Update: November 5, 2025 (9:20 AM ET): T-Mobile has confirmed to Android Authority that the DashPass by DoorDash offer has not changed, nor is it ending early. We’re told that the company began sending notifications yesterday about benefit eligibility to some customers who made specific account changes. However, some customers received the notification by mistake. T-Mobile adds that it is currently looking into reports where customers received the message in error. Original article: November 4, 2025 (12:09 PM ET): Back in July, T-Mobile began offering a new perk for its customers.

As someone who had never worn a ring before, I quickly found it incredibly comfortable and convenient. Within a week, all my initial concerns about wearing such a device vanished. I was surprised by the sheer amount of tech packed into something so tiny, and by the promises of powerful, continuous health tracking from a stylish ring that almost made me feel like I’d stepped into the future. Four months in, that’s where the honeymoon phase ended. The hard realities of current smart ring technology became impossible to ignore. This experience has proven exactly why these wearables will stay a niche product for several years before they can genuinely threaten the reign of smartwatches and established fitness trackers .",
