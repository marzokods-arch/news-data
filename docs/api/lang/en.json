When Google announced 100x Pro Res Zoom on its new Pixel 10 Pro lineup — which uses AI to enhance a very digitally-zoomed-in photo — that question of what makes a photo a photo rang loudly in my mind. Does it really matter how the photo is created if you like the end result and it looks like what it’s supposed to look like? Well, that depends, and we’ll get to that, but first let’s dive in and take a look at what this 100x zoom looks like in real-life use. As far as the eye can see…and then some I was shocked the first time I scrolled all the way to the right on the zoom slider, snapped my photo, then watched the sparkles dance around on my screen as Google’s artificial intelligence worked to recreate and enhance what I only saw as a grainy, pixelated scene on my screen. Within a few moments, the dancing pixels dissolved to reveal the final result: an incredibly detailed and very accurate photograph of a scene that I could hardly see with my own eyes. Consider me mind-blown. That moment truly felt shocking.",

They failed for a variety of reasons — like price, redundancy, and utility — but the seeds they planted for a future of fully automated apps stuck around. These seeds grew into the “agentic AI” trend we see today. Companies are racing to build AI products that can perform tasks on your behalf, like helping you code a new project, booking an appointment, or ordering items online. As one of the leaders in the AI race, Google is also working on its own AI agents, with Gemini in Chrome being its most notable offering.",

I’ve already mentioned why Spotify Duo is perfect for my household, and then there’s Spotify Connect, which lets me control music on my PS4 and other devices through my phone. I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

Still, I’m sure we all know a few holdouts, or you might be one yourself. A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths . Many of those points still hold, but awareness has improved, and so has prepaid market penetration. When you remove some of the most common myths from the equation, what are the real reasons people still don’t switch to prepaid? I dug into the most common ones I hear from friends, family, and online communities. Here are the biggest reasons some people say prepaid isn’t worth the switch.

It’s a crowded field, filled with heavy-hitting alternatives like YouTube Music, Tidal, Deezer, and more. In a recent poll , we asked which of a few other apps you prefer — and there’s a clear winner. Given the choice between Bandcamp, Deezer, SoundCloud, Tidal, and YouTube Music, Google’s music app came out ahead by a wide margin. Nearly half of survey respondents preferred YouTube Music — taking out the “other” option, YouTube Music got more votes than all the other options in our survey combined.",

Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor.

It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements.

Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route. Breaking down longer routes encourages users to hit more manageable targets across a more extended training session or race.

It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models.

The new system requires Android to check if a developer is verified, which in some cases will necessitate an active internet connection during installation. Hobbyist developers can get a free account but will face strict distribution limits, requiring them to manually authorize each device installing their app. Back in August, Google made an announcement that shocked Android enthusiasts and privacy advocates: Starting next year, Android will block the installation of apps from unverified developers . This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay. The company also shared new details about how its developer verification requirements will be enforced, including that, in some cases, Android will require an active network connection to sideload apps. Last month, we spotted evidence in the Android SDK suggesting develop…",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels.

Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience.

Satellite connectivity is restricted to select optimized apps such as WhatsApp, X, AccuWeather, AllTrails, and T-Life, with no support for full web browsing. While the service works reliably once connected, our own testing shows that establishing a satellite connection can often be difficult in some cases. T-Mobile officially launched its T-Satellite service earlier this summer, which brings satellite texting to select T-Mobile plans or to AT&amp;T, Verizon, and prepaid customers as a stand-alone option. Now the service is getting a major upgrade with the introduction of satellite data. As you might expect, there are a few catches here. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
