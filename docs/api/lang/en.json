Google has offered Family Group functionality for years now, allowing you to share payment info, calendars, notes, cloud storage, and more with your household. However, it looks like Samsung is working on its own Family Group feature in One UI 8.5 . SammyGuru reports that One UI 8.5 will let you create a family group using your Samsung account. Once you’ve created a group, you can invite others to join it. Check out the outlet’s screenshots below.",

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well. That said, there are plenty of great alternatives to AT&amp;T if you are willing to give prepaid a chance.",

The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",

Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience.

Recently, some Galaxy Watch owners have noticed their sleep scores rising through the stratosphere. With no obvious behavioral changes to blame, this may be due to a change in the sleep score algorithm. Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of. But are you sure you can trust that data? Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Last month, this stopped working, and Gemini will only create new pictures that are square. Google says that it’s working on a fix, and there are some workaround you can use until then. If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place. But what’s currently going on with Gemini and image generation is proving to be nothing short of maddening.",

The deal applies to the Visible Plus Pro plan, which offers premium features such as unlimited 5G UW data, hotspot use, smartwatch service, and international perks. This limited-time offer is available until November 3 and includes taxes and fees in the monthly price. Visible is likely the prepaid service I recommend the most to those looking for a low-cost alternative to postpaid without noticeably sacrificing network performance, and that’s especially true for its Visible Plus and Visible Plus Pro plans. While the most expensive of these options typically runs for $45 a month (taxes and fees included), what if you could get six months of service for just $22.50 a month ? Starting today, if you prepay for 3 months of service ($135), you’ll get an additional three months for absolutely free. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone.

The company is also launching the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic collection in four colors: Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight. The Oura app is also gaining new features, including multi-ring support, which enables users to switch between multiple Oura devices on a single account. Oura just addressed one of the biggest gripes about its smart rings : charging on the go. The company has unveiled a new portable charging case capable of storing up to five full charges. This update helps Oura catch up in a space where rivals have a head start. Many rings, including RingConn’s and the Samsung Galaxy Ring, already offer portable charging cases, giving the devices a practical edge. By adding its own, Oura finally regains ground in one of the few areas competitors had pulled ahead.",

The Aerial button will allow for a quick and seamless transition to Satellite View and back. The Aerial button even remembers the direction from Street View when transitioning into Satellite View, enhancing the user experience. Google Maps has a ton of great features that make it one of the best navigation apps on Android . One such feature is Street View, which presents users with images of the actual street and surroundings in mapped areas. Street View allows users to explore neighborhoods virtually, but there isn’t a clean method to seamlessly transition from Street View to Satellite View (which is also useful for virtual exploration). Google could soon solve this with a new Aerial button that lets users transition from Street View to Satellite View in a matter of seconds.

Today, we’re recounting legendary apps that helped shape Android and made it more meaningful than the barebones stock version of yesteryears. Here are my top picks for Android apps that had a fundamental — almost irreplaceable — role on Android phones in the past.

Update: October 1, 2025 (3:03 AM ET): YouTube TV has announced that it’s reached a short-term extension with NBCUniversal. The two parties are still negotiating a longer agreement, though. You can read the full story here . Original article: September 25, 2025 (6:02 PM ET): Is there anything more pathetic than when big companies take their petty spats public? You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation.",

And my favorite thing there might have been a dinky little $20 light switch. To be fair, this is more than just a simple switch, and the $19.99 Amazon Basics Smart Dimmer Switch and Remote for Music and Routines does a whole lot more, as its mouthful of a name should hopefully convey. It may live on your wall, but pops right out at a moment’s notice to serve as a convenient remote control.",

As it stands today, when you search for an app with the Pixel Launcher’s search bar, the top result is the installed application on your phone. However, you have to tap the app icon in the results to open it.

It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future.

It’s a feature so simple and well-thought-out that I believe it should be a standard component of every single Android phone . At the very least, I’d like to see it adopted on Pixel phones, as that might finally convince me to switch back to the device’s default Pixel Launcher.",

It’s the first chipset ever to be built on a 2nm fabrication process. The Exynos 2600 production cycle already has a 50% yield, suggesting the chip may be ready in time. Next-gen Android flagships have already started to arrive on the back of Qualcomm’s earlier-than-usual announcement of its Elite phone chipset. After Xiaomi 17, the OnePlus 15 is inching closer to its launch. But while there’s no confirmation about the Galaxy S26 series’ launch timeline, we now have another piece of evidence supporting the fact that it will not be a Snapdragon-only affair . Samsung’s semiconductor division has reportedly kicked off mass production of the slated Exynos 2600 chipset. Korean news outlet The Bell states that Samsung has not only achieved this feat earlier than expected, but it has accomplished it while increasing the wafer’s yield to 50%, up from 30% in the first quarter of the year.",

However, if history is any indication, I think you should look elsewhere. Security cameras are a dime a dozen these days, and many of them are so cheap that it’s ludicrous to consider something as expensive as a $100-200 Nest Cam. Better yet, many of these other cameras offer more controls, greater privacy, and more options than Google will ever provide, so why choose Nest? This was my dilemma about a year ago when I bought my new home. I really wanted to go in with Google — I already had the company’s Nest speakers and hubs, and I used the Google Home app to control the rest of my smart home, so it made sense to get cameras that worked well with all of this. But after careful consideration, I couldn’t justify paying this much on a Nest Cam and committing to a monthly subscription. I looked into Nest Cam alternatives and landed on the TP-Link Tapo C225 () instead. I couldn’t be happier with my choice. Here’s why.",

The company made its debut at the annual summit during the “SEE the Future” forum on September 25, co-hosted by organizations including the World Economic Forum’s GAEA initiative, the SEE Foundation, the Foundations Platform 20, and Columbia University’s Climate School. Jackery’s Global Head of Brand and Public Relations, Tracy Wang, joined a panel alongside UN and academic leaders to tackle a pair of big questions: how green energy supports ecological conservation and how to build lasting alliances for sustainable development. “Green energy shouldn’t stop at the product — it must be the infrastructure behind ecological protection and climate response,” Wang told the audience.",
