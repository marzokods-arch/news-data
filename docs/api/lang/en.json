It was only a matter of time until the reaper came knocking, and that day is today with the 1.3.0 patch notes . In short, the Venator has had its incrementally upgraded fire rate reduced from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, and its weight from 2kg to 5kg. Embark explains in the patch notes that it's \"re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact.\" \"This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the w…",

Overall, Nvidia raked in $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025 . That's 62% up on the same quarter in 2024 and 22% up on Q2 2025. It was enough to have CEO and leather jacket impresario Jensen Huang comment, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" Reflecting the importance of Nvidia not just to the ongoing AI boom but the entire global economy, markets across the world rallied in response to Nvidia's record earnings. Nvidia's own share price went up, too, inevitably. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia's current share price of around $196 in after hours trading is still well down on its October peak of $212, perhaps reflecting that even these new and impressive results aren't enough to entirely erase concerns over a mooted AI bubble and what might happen if it bursts. As for the future, Nvidia is predicting even higher revenues. It has next quarter pencilled in at $65 billion and Nvidia CFO Colette Kress predicted another $350 billion in AI GPU sales between now and the end of 2026.…",

    "body": "After its collaboration with Infinity Nikki , I thought it would be a while before Stardew Valley jumped into another random game for an elusive partnership. But, to my surprise, we've left the planet for a more galactic adventure this time around, though it won't be the farm life we're used to. That's right, Stardew Valley has teamed up with Among Us to bring a bundle of 29 themed cosmetics for your little avatar, so you no longer have to rely on the sprout hat. This package includes things like a Krobus and Junimo Pet, a Mayor Lewis outfit, and a Linius outfit, among many others which will let you cosplay as Abigail, Sebastian, and Mr Qi. No matter how rogue your favourite character is in Stardew, it seems Among Us have tried to create an outfit for everyone in their Cosmicube. For those who don't know what that means, a Cosmicube is basically a bundle of themed cosmetics which you can buy for in-game currency, which in this case is Beans.

Nvidia announced the deal on Tuesday , with its two partners making their own announcements simultaneously. Nvidia's post explains that as ChatGPT competitor Claude is being scaled up using Microsoft Azure—which itself uses Nvidia's hardware—it made sense for the three companies to enter into a more formal relationship. Hence, Anthropic is committing to buy up $30 billion worth of Azure compute capacity, while Microsoft has agreed to invest $5 billion back into Anthropic, and Nvidia will also offer up $10 billion to Claude's creator. It's almost more money than my bog-standard grey matter wants to compute. But back to silicon—Nvidia says it will also collaborate with Anthropic at a technical level. The company says the pair will co-ordinate \"on design and engineering, with the goal of optimizing Anthropic models for the best possible performance, efficiency and TCO, and optimizing future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic workloads.\" Anthropic has committed to 1 gigawa…",

Casually waving hello to solo raiders as they loot the locker you were hoping to have to yourself is not as novel or fun the hundredth time it happens, especially after you've gotten good enough at eluding Arc patrols that even they're only rarely a threat. Last week, I went on three raids in a row without firing a shot. It's at this point that solo players looking to zest up their routine might turn to the dark side: picking fights out in the open, setting traps at extraction points, or the least forgivable 2012-ass DayZ behavior of all, shooting randos in the back after establishing a \"Don't shoot!\" truce. Banditry did cross my mind. PvP is pretty fun in Arc Raiders, after all, and after 43 hours I still haven't gotten to do very much of it . But I've come to value Arc Raiders' gentle culture so much (and judge every hostile player so harshly) that I can't become the hypocrite now. I'd sooner uninstall.

It's very sharp and stylish, and Mielgo wants you (as in, everyone ) to know that it was not made using generative AI. \"I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO,\" Mielgo wrote on Instagram (via Kotaku ). \"Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with [a] huge team—155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.\" I don't know where the AI allegations are coming from, to be honest: There's nothing in the comments on YouTube (or at least nothing that isn't buried so deeply as to be irrelevant), nor have I run across anything on Reddit.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. If I were to show you a tiny sliver of a screenshot from a game like Counter-Strike or Minecraft or The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you could probably identify it easily, even without context. The art style and scenery and even the color palate of the games we play eventually get burned into our brains. But how about if I snipped a letter out of a game's stylized title? Think you could identify them, too? If I showed you just an X or a B or a Q, could you tell me what game title it was from? That's today's quiz, and we're going through the entire alphabet, A-Z. I'll show you 26 letters I painstaking cut out of game logos, and you type in the game name. (Feel free to use hints if you get stuck.) Remember, not every letter I show you is the first letter of the game name! And B sure to let us know how U scored in the comments, K?",

Most players run into a quest early on where you need to heal a goose, but failing it causes the goose to transform into a demon known as Maniacal Goose. Not to excuse the goose or anything, but it does turn red, gain a boss health bar, and start chasing you, so you'd think people would realize what they're getting into. But there's an achievement involved for killing it and we all know that's gamer kryptonite. As players of the new game wrestled with the demon goose and the other geese you can find hanging out in the open world, a strategy formed: throw them into the water and let nature take care of it.

The fact that it cost $15 didn't help, and most players at the time were mourning Hopoo's exit and what they saw as a naked attempt to cash in. Things are going a bit better this time. While also costing $15—nearly two-thirds the price of the base game— Alloyed Collective adds a whole lot to the game, including two new characters, seven stages with new music tracks, and a new final boss. More importantly, it doesn't seem to be breaking fundamental game systems like physics and how damage is calculated. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, at least among folks who've bought the DLC. The Risk of Rain 2 Steam forums have not been so generous, with reactions like \"Gearbox slop\" and complaints that the DLC isn't free all over the place.

Hughes and Speckert don't have any screenplays about being chained together a la Chained Together on their resumes yet, but they have worked on another videogame adaptation: the upcoming Finding Frankie film, the source material for which looks to be one of those not-quite-Five Nights at Freddy's-type games littered about Steam. It's an odd choice for an adaptation. Chained Together doesn't strike me as a narratively inclined game, but then again, neither do Minecraft , Outrun , or Rampage .

    "body": "Arc Raiders players have torn through the game like a pack of ravenous, apricot-devouring hyenas in the three weeks since launch. Steam achievement data shows that 39% of players have earned more than 1 million in loot value, and 16.5% have safely descended the elevator and/or subway back to Speranza more than 100 times. Embark Studios has a hit on its hands, but the community is figuring out the game quickly. In the first week, the Arc were seen as fearsome, clever threats. In the second week, I was seeing players surf them for sport and dunk on them with creative zipline/mine techniques . We know the roadmap has a snowfall map condition and some new quests in store in December, but it's going to take a lot to keep up with this hungry playerbase in 2026. Here are some ideas for expansion that we think Arc Raiders would benefit from: (Image credit: Embark Studios) Meaningful Expeditions Sean Martin, Senior Guides Writer : So far, Arc Raiders has done a brilliant job of making each run feel meaningful, whether through quests, map modifiers, or the big events like breaking open Stella Montis, but currently it feels like we're lacking in some form of meta progression.

Omelet You Cook launched to rave reviews from players, and over the past five months it's achieved one of the rarest of Steam milestones: 100% positive reviews. Over 500 reviews, not a single one of them negative. That is until this week, when one cook spoiled the broth with a red thumbs-down among the sea of blue approval. The lone negative review for Omelet You Cook isn't actually negative, though. \"Game is amazing,\" writes the reviewer. \"I just like to be different.\" Look, I've seen plenty of joke negative reviews on Steam before, often along the lines of \"Why are you searching for negative reviews? Just go play the game, it's great!\" But it's especially bold to post a negative review that breaks that lovely 100% positive streak that's been rolling along for months—just for a joke. I tip my cap. \"As I'm sure…",

As cliché as it sounds, the results will surprise you. Firstly, my beloved Stitcher is the most efficient of the bunch, wringing out 13,700 damage/1950 shots per full repair at level 4, which works out to just two credits per shot.

Dailian quotes a Samsung report claiming, \"the 2nm first-generation gate-all-around (GAA) process has improved performance by 5%, power efficiency by 8%, and area by 5% compared to the 3nm second-generation process.\" At first glance, those are not exactly mind blowing advances. For context, it's worth noting that comparing nodes between companies is awfully tricky. Superficially, you might expect Samsung's new 2 nm node, also known as SF2, to be broadly comparable to TSMC's upcoming N2 technology, which has yet to be seen in a chip you can actually buy but is also ostensibly a 2 nm-class node. On paper, you'd also throw Intel's 18A node into the same category. Again, Intel's 18A isn't out yet but is due any day now. In practice, it's way more complicated than that. For instance, the very notion of the implied scale of \"2 nm\" is now quite disconnected from actual feature size inside modern chips.

That puts it halfway to matching its predecessor's lifetime sales, including the sales of its well-received expanded edition, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It took Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen more than a decade to reach these numbers, so for the sequel to hit the halfway point in only a year and a half feels noteworthy. Given how quickly Dragon's Dogma 2 seemed to trail off, and how much the discussion around it focused on performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions, I'm surprised it's done so well. The lack of news around post-launch support, like DLC or a Dark Arisen-style expansion, suggested Capcom was shunting it off to the side.

For $269 ( direct from Thermal Grizzly ), you can have one as well, though let's be honest here: the Der8enchtable is going to be of zero use to the vast majority of PC enthusiasts.

Broadly speaking, it's an effort to catch up with Nvidia's equivalent DLSS technologies, which have been ahead of AMD's curve when it comes to the use of machine learning in general, along with some specific capabilities that AMD lacks. The headline enhancement is more fully leveraging machine learning for upscaling, which is why, as we understand it and as the new AMD teaser trailer implies, Redstone will be tied to AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs, such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT . Only the latest AMD graphics architecture has sufficient hardware matrix math ability to run the AI code. Or so the story likely goes, anyway. Slightly confusingly, AMD has also said that Redstone can run on Nvidia GPUs on account of being developed using code from a ROCm project known as AMD ML2CODE (Machine Learning to Code).

OK, these days they're probably more likely to be on-board with the superb sequel , but still. With that 20th anniversary in mind, developer ArenaNet has announced the most substantial overhaul in the game's history: December 3 will see the launch of Guild Wars Reforged , a visual and gameplay overhaul for the venerable monster-bothering quest-em-up. Reforged is co-developed by ArenaNet and new studio 2weeks, which is largely composed of former ArenaNet staff, and bills itself as a modernised version of the game and its (many) expansions. The visuals have had an HD overhaul, performance has been tweaked, the UI has been reworked, there's a new (optional) objective guide, and Reforged also boasts proper controller support and Steam Deck optimisation. The overhaul will be free for existing owners of the game, but will also lower the price point to $20 for the game's complete package for anyone who wants to dive in fresh.

Yes, I had to look it up. In the case of the former, this rare earth element is vital for a number of engineering processes, including semiconductor manufacturing—and as a result of an export-related supply shortage, prices have risen from $8 per kilogram at the end of last year to $126 per kg in 2025 (via Bloomberg ). While US president Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping late last month resulted in a pause on some of its rare earth restrictions, earlier global controls outlined in April of this year are still in place. These restrictions require companies to obtain licenses from Beijing before exporting rare earth materials out of the country, and the approvals granted to date are said to be for small shipments only . That's a serious issue for the global manufacturing supply chain, as China is estimated to control roughly 69% of rare earth mining , and refines nearly all of the yttrium currently available.

For the uninitiated, transmog (sometimes called glamour in other MMOs) is a system that allows players to slap a new appearance over their current gear. In WoW, you used to go to a transmog NPC, create an outfit, and pay a gold fee to throw on your fit. This would essentially overwrite the appearances of those items with the ones you transmogged them to. In Midnight, that's all changing. You can see a handy summary by WoWHead here , but in essence, WoW's moving from this overwritten appearance system to an \"outfit\" system. And, while I'm about to do a whole bunch of grumbling, there are some major benefits to what Blizzard's put together. Essentially, the system—currently on the Midnight Beta—allows you to make outfits that can, at the drop of a hat (and chestpiece, and trousers, and boots), be thrown over your existing gear without having to bleed gold every time you get a new purple.

Even then, you'll only get an XP boost once a day from these actions, and waiting until the next day when you want to head to the next area can feel like waiting a lifetime. When you hit level 2 with your horses, you can also assign skills to each pony like mining rocks, digging holes, and harvesting or watering crops which does give you another avenue for XP farming. But, as much as I love how efficient it is to mine resources and farm now you don't have to deplete your own stamina, it's by no means a fast process. Luckily, outside of gift giving and quality time, you can also work on your bond by riding them around and jumping over obstacles, but this process is still pretty arduous. Fortunately, I've found a hidden spot that, with a bit of decorating, can be a vital tool in levelling your horses, and make things feel much more efficient. (Image…",

Each run you choose a card that allows you to transform into one—a kind of ugly little monster with its own unique attack style and special ability. New cards can be found over the course of the run, and you can hold up to three at a time, so you can shift between forms. But with that framework established, Morsels immediately throws you in at the deep end. Its world is utterly chaotic and full of unexplained phenomena, and it quickly starts to feel like an exam you forgot to study for. (Image credit: …",
