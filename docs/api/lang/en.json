    "body": "Taylor Swift continues her domination of the ARIA charts this week, locking in her fourth consecutive double-header as The Life of a Showgirl and “The Fate of Ophelia” remain at No. 1 on the Albums and Singles charts, respectively. The feat marks yet another high in a standout year for Swift, with both her re-recordings and original material continuing to perform strongly in Australia. Her latest chart-toppers have held steady across Halloween week — a fitting flex for a pop sorceress who’s made chart magic her signature move. Meanwhile, Australian country artist James Johnston celebrates a new career high, debuting at No. 5 with his sophomore album Where You’ll Find Me , which also lands at No. 1 on the ARIA Australian Albums Chart. It follows the success of his debut Raised Like That , which peaked at No. 7 in 2023. British pop icon Lily Allen returns to the top 10 with West End Girl , her first album in seven years. The project opens at No. 6, becoming her fifth top 10 ARIA album. Her previous efforts include 2009’s chart-topping It’s Not Me, It’s You and 2014’s Sheezus , which peaked at No. 4.

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR OnePlus’ next small phone just leaked, and it packs big upgrades. The OnePlus 15T is expected to feature a larger battery, an improved fingerprint scanner, and a new Snapdragon chipset. The sad part, though, is that OnePlus might not launch it in the US. The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S . Therefore, it could be speculated to be called the OnePlus 15T or 15S, in line with the naming convention for the recently launched flagship.",

We’re expecting plenty of new features, ranging from Pro camera presets and sharing to Galaxy S26 Ultra exclusive features like Private Display , and more.

    "body": "TL;DR Google Photos backs up RAW images alongside JPGs, which takes a lot of cloud storage. Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

The leak came from a private Google Teams call that someone joined and screenshotted before posting on a GrapheneOS forum. Pixel devices running standard Android still allow limited data access before first unlock, but GrapheneOS versions appear to block it more effectively. Google Pixel phones already have a solid reputation for security, but leaked Cellebrite documents show they’re even harder to crack when running GrapheneOS , the privacy-focused Android alternative. Cellebrite builds the forensic tools law enforcement uses to get data from locked phones. As reported by 404 Media , the leak came from someone who managed to join a private Microsoft Teams call between Cellebrite staff and a prospective customer.

Several comments on Reddit point to S22 phones also getting the update on AT&amp;T. The rollout status of One UI 8 for unlocked S22 phones is unclear. One UI 8 has been making its way to Samsung phones in fits and starts for a few weeks now. The rollout has hit major milestone this week, with the Galaxy S22 series now receiving the update on multiple carriers in the US. Verizon has updated support pages for the Galaxy S22, S22+, and S22 Ultra to show that, starting today, each is eligible to download Android 16-based One UI 8 along with the October Android security patch. This comes after Samsung started and then paused One UI 8 distribution for international S22, S23, and S24 phones earlier this month.",

The carrier has now filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the self-regulatory body. You may have caught the commercial by now, where AT&amp;T uses Luke Wilson to talk about T-Mobile as a “master of breaking promises.” The commercial in question highlights the Un-Carrier’s deceptive ads and other transgressions.

    "summary": "Android 17 could introduce a new “Min Mode” feature that lets apps display custom interfaces on the AOD.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new “Min Mode” feature for the Always-On Display that will allow apps to show their own minimal, persistent interfaces. This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

The X300 Pro is the higher-end model, offering a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto camera and a larger battery. The X300 starts at €1,049 (~$1,215), while the X300 Pro will cost €1,399 (~$1,620) This yeah, vivo is marking its 30th anniversary with two new flagships, the X300 and X300 Pro, and the highlights are simple: 200MP ZEISS imaging across the board, plus a fresh global debut for OriginOS 6. The formula here isn’t shock value; it’s a focused push on photography, performance, and long-term software support that reads like a confident year-over-year step rather than a gamble. Both phones lean hard on ZEISS hardware and tuning, but they take different routes to get there. The X300 pairs a 200MP Ultra-Sensing HPB main camera with a 50MP ZEISS APO telephoto (LYT-602) and a 50MP ultrawide (JN1). The Pro flips things for telephoto fans, using a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto as its centerpiece, backed by a 50MP “gimbal-grade” main camera (vivo × Sony LYT-828, 1/1.28-inch) and a 50MP ultrawide. Both phones also upgrade the selfie system with a 50MP ZEISS wide-angle front cam…",

And why not? Android devices offer a vast selection of music streaming platforms , surprisingly capable speakers, and some of the best Bluetooth connectivity around. Still, Android’s audio signal chain remains a bit of a black box. What actually happens to your music between the app and your headphone driver is often unclear. To lift the veil, here’s how Android handles your audio — and what you can do to get the best possible sound.",

Sheets support is currently limited to NotebookLM Plus users, i.e., those who subscribe to Google’s AI Plus or AI Pro plans. NotebookLM is easily one of Google’s most highly cherished AI tools , with fewer haters than any other of Google’s apps. It lets you research and process data from numerous different sources and convert verbose formats into digestible chunks, or even AI-generated podcasts and video essays. With an upcoming update, Google is set to improve file support for free users. Google Drive integration already lets you import files from Docs and Slides as sources to NotebookLM. But the research tool lacks support for Google Sheets (or .XLS and .XLSX files) in the free tier. Thankfully, if you’ve been yearning for the option to import your Sheets or Excel files to NotebookLM, Google may be bringing it to you soon.",

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call. According to a new report from The Mobile Report , all but one of these options is going away.",

Those screens won’t integer scale DS games, and the SoC is too weak for the MelonDS emulator. The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

The chipset is expected to be built on TSMC’s newer N3P fabrication process, which is also used for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It follows a similar design to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, including Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, but with a lower clock speed than the Elite Gen 5. In addition to launching the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 earlier than usual this year, Qualcomm also confirmed it is working on the non-Elite variant of the chipset. The standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 has yet to hit the market, but Qualcomm has already shared some specifics about the chipset, including a vague description of the CPU. Now, a recent leak is plugging any previous gap in information with more details. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared specifications for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, including its CPU and GPU . Per the leak, the chipset is set to be fabricated on TSMC’s N3P 3nn process, identical to the Elite edition. This is TSMC’s third-gen 3nm process, which offers marginal gains in performance and efficiency over the N3E process that was utilized for the Snapdragon 8 Elite from last year.",

The HiBreak S features a 5.84-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display, available in both color and black-and-white variants. The panel’s matte finish keeps reflections to a minimum, while a 36-level front light with adjustable color temperature makes it easy to read in any lighting.

We’ve made no secret of the fact that we really like NotebookLM. It’s one of Google’s best AI tools right now, and we’ve used it for everything from sorting apartment contracts to pulling together health explainers and gaming guides. It’s not perfect , but it’s genuinely useful. Google’s latest update introduces several more handy upgrades, including a new way to set goals that steer chat behavior. In a blog post today, Google said it’s rolling out a bunch of upgrades to NotebookLM, including this new feature for chat. You can now define a goal, voice, or role for each notebook in the same way you might give ChatGPT instructions on how to respond. For example, you might tell it to act like a research advisor, a marketing strategist, or even a game master. Once set, the chatbot maintains that tone and approach throughout the entire conversation.",

Possibly the most tangible pop culture artifact of this AI era, though, is the standalone AI gadget. Devices like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 , both released last year, were designed to connect us directly to AI-powered services without graphical user interfaces getting in the way. These first-gen AI baubles were nearly universally panned — but evidently, Rabbit is ready to give it another try as early as next year.",

The camera hardware has been downgraded, featuring smaller sensors and slower apertures compared to the OnePlus 13. Other key changes include improved stereo speakers, fewer microphones (three vs four), and an upgraded vapor chamber for cooling. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 15 in China this week, positioning itself as a contender for the best next-gen Android flagship . We expect to see the OnePlus 15 make its way to global markets soon, so if you haven’t already bought a OnePlus flagship, you shouldn’t buy one until the new flagship launches.

Retroid is one of the most popular brands in Android gaming handhelds , but it seems like every new product the company releases is immediately mired in controversy. The highly anticipated Pocket 6, which follows the fan-favorite Pocket 5, has once again proven this true, as it has now been pulled from pre-sale after less than a day. While fans are pleased with the pricing and the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the physical design of the handheld has been met with widespread disapproval in the community. The new row of buttons beneath the screen, which gives it a more retro look, reduces the overall screen-to-body ratio, and some feel that it’s a step backwards.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 16 introduces “seamless app updates” to make installing app updates faster and less disruptive. This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Gemini shortcut, part of the Google app, on Android now uses a true black background instead of gray. Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",
