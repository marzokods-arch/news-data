    "body": "If you watched Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s moving, 22-minute tribute to his longtime bandleader and lifelong best friend, saxophonist Cleto Escobedo III last week following the musician&#8217;s death at age 59 , you know how crushing the loss was for the late night host. Now, following his tearful tribute to Escobedo, Kimmel is looking to raise funds for two organizations in his friend&#8217;s honor. In an Instagram post over the weekend, Kimmel shared a picture of Escobedo smiling with his wife, two children and their dog and another of the two pals laughing as they cradle their instruments in a parking lot. &#8220;Cleto was always kind and eager to help others. As we mourn his loss, we have started two fundraisers to celebrate his life and give back,&#8221; wrote Kimmel . &#8220;The first is for UCLA Medical Center where he received such incredible care. Together we can help vulnerable patients and families in need of financial assistance during hard times. @UCLAHealth . &#8220;In memory of our friend Cleto, we’d like to thank all the hardworking specialists, doctors, and nurses at UCLA. They worked tirelessly and generously to give him the best care,&#8221; reads a note on the fundrai…",

The Spanish superstar stunned as she brought a literal fairytale to life with dreamlike precision. Wearing a shoulderless pearlesque gown — fluffy and ethereal like a ballerina — she commanded the stage with her signature blend of softness and power. Her honeyed yet striking vocals took center stage, weaving through orchestral accompaniment heavy on violins. Her artistry was enhanced by her bold look: bleached hair at the crown subtly evoked the image of a glowing halo, adding a celestial feel to her performance. As the camera slowly widened its frame, the scene revealed Rosalía perched atop a towering stack of lilac-sheeted mattresses, a nod to the whimsical tale of The Princess and the Pea . The performance reached its crescendo when she descended from the mattresses, carried by two men, and pulled out a monumental pearl. Her charm extended beyond her show, as Rosalía led an impromptu lesson teaching Fallon how to vocalize and clap flam…",

The entertainer announced on Sept. 28 that she was postponing an upcoming concert residency in Las Vegas to address health concerns. Her announcement became national news. Ten days later, she released a video attempting to clarify the situation and allay people’s fears. But even though Parton wasn’t present at the event, her presence was strongly felt. Lily Tomlin , her co-star in the 1980 film Nine to Five , presented the award. Andra Day sang a soulful version of one of Parton’s most prized songs, “Jolene.” Fellow honoree Tom Cruise paid tribute to all of the night’s other honorees. Of Parton, he said: “American original, legendary singer/songwriter, actress, storyteller, humanitarian, your performances, your songs, your work, your soul, you&#8217;re part of the very fabric of all of our lives, and you show that compassion and creativity are not separate. They are the same burning light.” Parton rece…",

The alt-rock band will hit the region in May for a run of five arena shows. The tour kicks off with back-to-back nights at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena on May 2–3, then heads to Brisbane Entertainment Centre on May 6 and Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena on May 9–10, before wrapping at Auckland’s Spark Arena on May 13. It marks Deftones’ first Australia and New Zealand tour in almost 10 years, underlining how rare a full-scale run from the band has become in the region. All shows will feature Interpol as special guests, with Melbourne artist Ecca Vandal opening. Interpol’s inclusion brings a stack of indie-rock staples — from 2000s breakthrough “Obstacle 1” and “Evil” to songs from more recent albums — while Ecca Vandal has earned a reputation at home for fusing punk, hip-hop and electronic influences into high-energy sets. The tour comes on the heels of Private Music , Deftones’ 10th studio album, released earlier this year.

The Sentinel-6B satellite lifted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California at 9:21 p.m. PST on Nov. 16. Contact between the satellite and a ground station in northern Canada occurred about 1 hour and 30 minutes later at 10:54 p.m. All systems are functioning normally. “Understanding tidal patterns down to the inch is critical in protecting how we use our oceans every day on Earth,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Sentinel-6B will build upon the legacy of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich by making sea level measurements that improve forecasts used by communities, businesses, and operations…",

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic – for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us.

But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the highest-…",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech NASA will provide live coverage of prelaunch and launch activities for Sentinel-6B, an international mission delivering critical sea level and ocean data to protect coastal infrastructure, improve weather forecasting, and support commercial activities at sea. Launch is targeted at 12:21 a.m. EST, Monday, Nov. 17 (9:21 p.m. PST, Sunday, Nov. 16) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Watch coverage beginning at 11:30 p.m. EST (8:30 p.m. PST) on NASA+, Amazon Prime, and more. Learn how to watch NASA content through a variety of platforms, including social media. The Sentinel-6B mission continues a decades-long effort to monitor global sea level and ocean conditions using precise radar measurements from space. Since the early 1990s, satellites launched by NASA and domestic and international partners have collected precise sea level data. The launch of Sentinel-6B will extend this dataset out to nearly four decades. NASA’s mission coverage is as follows (all times Eas…",
