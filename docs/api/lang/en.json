A new leak reveals that a Privacy Display card does appear in the Tips app for the Galaxy S26 Plus. The card appears to include the same animations and descriptive text as the one found on the spoofed S26 Ultra. When you’re out in public, the last thing you want is for nosy strangers to be looking at what you’re doing on your phone. Last year, we spotted code within a leaked build of One UI 8.5 that suggested Samsung was working on a solution for this problem, called Privacy Display. There have since been plenty of leaks suggesting that this will be a Galaxy S26 Ultra feature. But what about the other models in the series? A new leak may have revealed the answer to that question.

Nothing says a future update will let Phone 3a Lite users uninstall Lock Glimpse. Nothing phones started getting Android 16 with the rollout of Nothing OS 4.0 in November . On Nothing Phone 3a, 3a Pro , and 3a Lite, the update included a feature called Lock Glimpse, a widely panned addition that served ads on those phones’ lock screens. Now, Nothing has announced that it’s bowing to user pressure and removing the feature — at least on the 3a and 3a Pro. Lock Glimpse has always been an optional feature, technically — 3a series phones on Nothing OS 4.0 present the option to disable it. That solution wasn’t satisfactory, though, as users found the software was draining their batteries even when turned off . Today, Nothing shared that the feature is being removed from the 3a series (except the 3a Lite) as of the Nothing OS 4.0 December update.",

The feature was announced months ago, but now, it’s rolling out in a limited test. Meta announced its conversation focus feature at the company’s Connect event in September, and users have been able to sign up for a waitlist to try it since December. UploadVR spotted today that the feature is actually making its way to users who’ve signed up for Meta’s Early Access program.",

We now have our first visual proof that Perplexity AI is Bixby’s new brain. A new Bixby Live interface hints at real-time AI conversations, mirroring Gemini Live capabilities. Samsung’s Bixby has spent the better part of the decade being the assistant we love to disable, but the new One UI 8.5 update could make that decision harder. Rather than competing directly with Google Gemini, Samsung is reportedly following Apple’s lead by bringing in stronger AI support . We now have a detailed look at how Perplexity AI will supercharge Bixby to handle more complex tasks. Leaker @GalaxyTechie shared plenty of screenshots on X showing an early version of One UI 8.5 (via SamMobile ). In these images, Bixby sends complex questions to Perplexity instead of using its own limited knowledge. The responses look more like well-researched answers, complete with citations.",

    "body": "TL;DR xMEMS is showing off its µCooling system that uses ultrasonic speakers to move air. The system is silent, water-resistant, and can small enough to be used in wearables. A ducted µCooling solution for phones could move up to 0.1 cubic feet of air a minute. Heat is arguably the biggest enemy of modern processors. We can build incredibly fast chips, but run them too fast, and they’re going to start to melt down. As a result, nearly every device we use has to make some sort of balance between performance and thermal emissions. This year at CES in Las Vegas , we’re learning about an innovative new way that xMEMS is trying to tackle that problem, giving even compact mobile devices another option for staying cool.

It’s expected to launch in 2026 and will adopt a wider aspect ratio than most book-style foldables, so the iPhone unfolds into a layout somewhat similar to that of an iPad Mini. And one of its priorities is likely to build a folding inner screen without a visible crease. In the pursuit of building the perfect, crease-free iPhone Fold, Apple is supposedly tinkering with existing foldables from other brands. Based on a rumor shared by a Weibo account with the username “Fixed-focus digital cameras ,” Apple tore apart an OPPO Find N5 while trying to decode what enables the screen’s crease to be so minimal.",

The Find N7 will adopt a wider, passport-like form factor to directly compete with the anticipated iPhone Fold and Samsung’s wide foldable. Foldables are expected to receive more attention than usual this year, primarily due to Apple’s entry into the market with the iPhone Fold . This iPhone Fold is expected to feature a wider form factor than currently popular book-style foldables, and companies like Samsung are expected to launch their own wide foldable (alongside the regular Galaxy Z Fold 8) to compete.

Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently.

    "body": "TL;DR Google might have begun working on navigation support for Android XR using Google Maps. Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

Every year, alongside the headline-grabbing TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, there are products that don’t always get the same attention but still shape everyday life. Pool care is one of them. For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.

These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

Both models support cutting-edge standards, including Dolby Vision Gaming, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, and Filmmaker Mode. They feature MediaTek’s MT9655 chip and run Google TV based on Android TV 14. Kickstarter launches in early February at $2,199 (Max) and $1,999 (Pro), with retail availability starting in April for $4,499 and $3,499, respectively. Projectors are fast emerging as a popular alternative to having a giant TV in the living room , and it makes sense, too. Instead of having a TV imposing and commanding attention all the time, a projector moves out of the way when the job is done. At CES 2026 , we’ve seen numerous new projectors from companies such as Samsung , Epson , and XGIMI . If you’re still on the hunt for a performance-oriented projector, the new Aetherion projector from AWOL Vision could be worth checking out. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The phone is also tipped to have a 6.3-inch 165Hz screen, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a 50MP tele camera. The OnePlus 13S/13T had a very limited release, but we hope the new phone is widely available. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 13T in China last year, which was known as the OnePlus 13s in India. This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",

At CES 2026, the company confirmed the shortage is already raising costs and admitted it’s actively considering repricing products to match the new reality. DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",

The vulnerability can be used to trigger a zero-click attack on Android using an audio file. While the issue was fixed on Pixel devices last month, we’re still waiting for Google to fix other Pixel bugs, which should have been addressed in a separate Pixel Update for January. Google has freshly released the Android Security Bulletin for January 2026, listing a critical vulnerability that will be addressed in security updates. The list isn’t quite as long as the December 2025 bulletin , and that is because Google recently moved to publicly disclose a large chunk of security issues in Android on a quarterly basis rather than every month . In fact, the only critical vulnerability listed in the bulletin relates to the Dolby Digital Plus Codec , which is used for playing audio files on Android. As per Wiz , the vulnerability can allow hackers to manipulate the extra information, also known as evolution data, added to the audio file, which can force the player to crash on a broad range of devices.
