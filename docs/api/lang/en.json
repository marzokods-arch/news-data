The pair confirmed as much during a cozy courtside date in May 2025, with fans spotting the New England Patriots player and the Grammy winner cheering on the New York Knicks during the team&#8217;s showdown against the Boston Celtics. At one point, Cardi was seen on the Jumbotron lovingly squeezing Diggs&#8217; cheeks. Related Cardi B Welcomes Baby With Stefon Diggs: &#8216;One More Reason to Be the Best Version of&nbsp;Me&#8217; The following month, Cardi and the athlete would make their relationship Instagram official, making this the &#8220;Bodak Yellow&#8221; rapper&#8217;s first public relationship since filing for divorce from Offset in July 2024. Cardi is used to her relationships being in the public eye, dating all the way back to her Love &amp; Hip-Hop days in 2015. Aside from Offset, Cardi&#8217;s only other major public relationship was with rapper Tommy Jeez, from whom she split in 2017.

Everyone from Ray Charles to the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Cash, Madonna, Britney Spears, Drake, Taylor Swift have, at various points in SNL history, piloted different episodes of the series. It&#8217;s not an easy gig &#8212; especially for hosts who pull double duty and serve as their own musical guests &#8212; with show leads only getting one week of preparation before they are tasked with delivering live monologues and playing absurd characters in skits that challenge them to break away from their artistic images.

As The Earth Observer prepares its final publication, NASA also plans to shutter its three EOS flagship satellites (discussed below) possibly as early as the end of 2026. While EOS was “much more than its satellites,” one cannot deny that the satellite missions and their iconic images provide an entry point to the overarching work conducted by the EOS science teams for almost three decades.

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

Since its inception, NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) has led this effort. CERES has a long history with seven different instruments flying on five different missions since 1997. As of today, six CERES instruments remain in orbit – two are no longer operational: the Proto-Flight Model (PFM) unit flew on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and functioned for a brief period, and FM2, which was powered-off in January 2025 due to battery constraints on Terra. The active CERES instruments are found on Terra (FM1), Aqua (FM3 and 4), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) (FM5), and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) mission, now known as NOAA-20 (FM6).
