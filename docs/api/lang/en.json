    "body": "Well, it's my own fault, really. Despite writing an article about the reaction to Nvidia's brutal optimised settings charts for Borderlands 4, and being well aware of stuttering issues thanks to Nick's performance testing piece, I jumped into the game this weekend anyway. And, lo and behold, the stuttering was very much there—until I discovered a fix that's virtually eliminated the issue on my machine. It's not my own discovery, in fact, but that of YouTuber Ki11er Six , who posted a review of the game along with a crucial performance tip a few days ago. On Nvidia graphics cards, it's possible to manually adjust the shader cache size in the Control Panel—which Ki11er Six suggests should be set to 100 GB to prevent stuttering. (Image credit: Nvidia) To perform the fix yourself, first make sure the game isn't running. Then, simply right-click on your desktop, hit \"Show more options\" (depending on how you've got your Windows context menus set up), open the Nvidia Control Panel, and navigate in the side panel to \"Manage 3D settings.\" From there, scroll down in the Global Settings tab to Shader Cache Size, use the drop-down menu to select 100 GB, and hit Apply.

Pitchford's maths minute goes as follows: \"Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.\" That is to say, if 1,000,000 people had installed the game, a mere 10,000 of them would have filed tickets. Pitchford does a little legerdemain here—classic magician behaviour—and transitions to talking about the tickets as a percentage of the game's overall customers (everyone who has it installed). So, rather than saying that 55% of customer service tickets are about people's SHiFT accounts, he says 0.55% of customers are having problems, and so on. Bearing that in mind, Pitchford goes on to say that \"0.04% of customers [tickets] are PC performance related.\" The number gets smaller. Of that 0.04% o…",

Plus, if you've made it to any of the main bosses or final encounters in any of the vaults, you'll know just how much you'll have to use these in combat, especially the grapple. The unfortunate thing is, the grapple is clunky. Whenever you use your grappling hook, your camera will immediately turn to face towards the grapple spot like it's switched on aimbot for an inanimate object. Although it's done in an effort to show you where you're headed, it's enough to give you whiplash while you're rushing around the arena. What if I told you that there's a way to fix it? Head into the accessibility settings and disable ' grapple view tilt '.

    "body": "I remember my first gaming laptop—bought well over ten years ago now—with a somewhat complicated affection. On the one hand, I dropped 800 or so quid on it and it carried on chugging for a decade. On the other hand, it really kept me on my toes throughout the back half of its lifespan. Point being, a first gaming laptop is a momentous event, so can the Erazer Scout rise to the occasion? Well, the first major caveat to get out of the way is that this sub-brand of German consumer electronics company Medion (which itself is a member of the Lenovo group) does not currently sell outside of the UK and Europe. So, US-based readers looking longingly at that budget price tag are out of luck, I'm afraid. The second thing to bear in mind is that this gaming laptop contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 mobile GPU, an entry-level chip that, in desktop form, only promises performance comparable to the RTX 4060 , though you do get DLSS 4. Even without upscaling, this plucky little RTX 5050 gaming laptop still managed to squeeze out just a few more frames in gaming benchmarks than my actual rig , the iBuyPower RDY Y40 Valorant VCTA R003 desktop . But a few extra frames is only one corner of the pic…",

Fata Deum largely models itself off Populous and, more overtly, Black & White (sans creature), where you must compete with other gods by racing to convert mortal villages through warfare and miracles. The foundations are all present: you can inspire your followers, curse them with horrible visions, pick them up and toss them around, plonk down blueprints for new buildings that will make them happy, and send them off to find glory or death in battle. The problem is, right now, none of it is remotely fun.

One enlightening subject is writer and quest designer Mark Nelson, who was responsible for a chunk of Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, as well as fleshing out the starter village of Seyda Neen. He's the guy responsible for Tarhiel, the wizard who memorably falls out of the sky in front of you the moment you leave, for instance.

Cutscenes were wonky as all get-out, with characters not appearing where they were supposed to (if at all), and sometimes sliding into or out of frame as if they were on rollerskates. Cutscene audio often crackled, making dialogue sound cheap and staticky. There were graphical problems too, with resolution options I would charitably call \"limited\" and water that turned black at a distance. It wasn't a great port, it was just a great enough game that I could overlook those and other flaws. There have been multiple attempts to improve Saints Row 2's PC port over the years, and the latest is the most impressive. Called Saints Row 2 Juiced, it fixes all the problems I mentioned in the previous paragraph and more. For example, it adds more than 30 animations that were included in console versions but not on PC, which will make you look much cooler while you're shooting a minigun or running with the rocket launcher equipped.

This early Silksong champion is CrankyTemplar on YouTube, who also appears to have done a lot of Hollow Knight 1 challenge content previously. CrankyTemplar uploaded a first no-hit compilation of Silksong's early bosses the day it came out, releasing subsequent addendums over the following days. CrankyTemplar put out a crowning, nearly two hour-long supercut of beating every boss without taking damage on Thursday, September 11⁠—exactly one week after the game released. For a game widely agreed to be extremely challenging, one that PCG contributor Tyler Colp called \"worth the pain\" in his 90% review of Silksong , I find this to be a staggering accomplishment for how quickly CrankyTemplar managed it.

The clip shows Geralt, an elf, and a dwarf squaring off with a wraith in a dark forest. Dialogue-wise, we just get a little of that Witcher pre-fight monster explaining, the sort of thing Geralt would mutter while looking at clues, but Hemsworth hits the right notes with a similar growl to original Geralt actor Henry Cavill. The choreography of the fight is also physical and legible in a way I dig: Not so many cuts that you can't tell what the hell's going on, and some actually interesting flow to it. The fight's dominated by the specter knocking Geralt over and trying to drag him back to its crypt, before he jams his sword in the ground to slow it and then Aards his way to freedom.

Right out of the gate, O'Brien's eyes seemed to glaze over while listening to the lore behind the game, joking, \"Can you just say to people 'these are robots' and they go 'PEW PEW PEW'?\" After getting through an opening cutscene he compared to a Russian novel, O'Brien met the infamous Claptrap and immediately joined the legions of gamers who hate the peppy little rolling box. \"You know what's great about this little Claptrap guy? He'll never get annoying,\" O'Brien quipped. After mimicking the robot's voice, he added, \"He's my least favorite trash can, and that's really saying something.\" The great tragedy is that O'Brien could have muted the memetically hated robot companion thanks to a new option in Borderlands 4's sound menu⁠—you really gotta hand it to Gearbox on that one, it's a great bit. But perhaps for the sake of good content, O'Brien was forced to endure. O'Brien then managed to take out some kratches and fought for his life during a trip to the Lambent Mines⁠—at least until the game crashed on him a…",

It really peaked in 1996, when Tim Burton and Jonathan Gems created Mars Attacks!, a B-movie pastiche based on the ancient TCG. OK, maybe I'm rewriting history a wee bit here. Mars Attacks! largely bombed, likely not helped by the fact that it launched in the same year as Independence Day. But it was fun and weird and probably gave a few people nightmares after it grafted Sarah Jessica Parker's head onto her dog's body. Fast forward three decades and Mars Attacks! doesn't have much of a legacy, despite its exceptional cast—Jack Nicholson, Glen Close, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Michael J Fox, to name but a few—and its cult status. At least until now, because it's finally getting a videogame adaptation, Mars Attracts . Open for business (Image credit: Outlier) Developer Outlier has smartly avoided going down the simplest route that so many adaptations have sauntered down before: a by-the-numbers action game.

    "body": "Quake and Quake 2 are, famously, very different shooters. The original is a dark gothic fantasy with a side of HP Lovecraft, while the latter leans hard into industrial sci-fi. I've always thought of them as entirely separate stories, but Quake 2's latest official episodes—the Machine Games-developed Call of The Machine —explicitly connects the two, with the episode's primary antagonist summoning several Shamblers from the first game to attack the player. This overlap serves as the primary inspiration for Call of the Void , a fanmade Quake 2 episode that takes place after Call of The Machine. This episode throws together Quake 1 and 2's menagerie in much more literal fashion, splicing the roster of both games to create an army of monstrous hybrids. The episode consists of five \"huge\" new maps that mix \"new and old scenarios from both franchises\". Whether this means the maps are inspired by or directly based upon levels from the first two Quake games is unclear. What is clear, weirdly for a Quake game, is the plot. The mod's premise sees your character allying with the race of gods that Quake 1 bosses Chton and Shub-Niggurath descended from, after the Strogg took their remains and,…",

Such is the case with Keep Digging , which lifts the premise of DoubleBee's surprise hit A Game About Digging A Hole , er, wholesale, opens up its shovelling shenanigans for up to eight players, then rests its hard hat over its eyes for a wee nap while the cash rolls in. Like DoubleBee's burrowing sim, Keep Digging sees players break ground using basic tools like spades and pickaxes, which they use to unearth valuable ores and treasures. These can be sold to purchase more advanced equipment like dynamite, wire rope, and batteries. I presume the latter are used to power some other excavation device, but the Steam page just reads \"batteries\" so it isn't clear.

If you haven't braved Arma 3's hyper realistic battlefields, now might be the time to do so. The game is currently 90% off, making it cheaper than a cup of coffee. The discount is part of Bohemia Interactive's Steam publisher sale , which has most of the Czech studio's cheaper than usual. Arma 3 for $3 (£2.50) is by far the best deal of the bunch, though. The single-player campaign, which was released over a period of three years, is pretty strong. But really it's the multiplayer where Arma 3 is at. Whether you're playing ops with friends, building your own scenarios, or getting involved with RP servers like Arma life , it has tons of different experiences to offer.

It's that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly is getting a remake, and it'll be available on PC next year. \"This title has undergone a complete overhaul,\" the Steam page says, \"with improvements to everything from visuals and audio to the core gameplay systems and controls. The signature Camera Obscura mechanic, used to capture and fend off spirits, remains a key feature, now offering richer and more engaging gameplay in both exploration and combat. In addition, the new 'Holding Hands with Mayu' mechanic adds a heartfelt touch, letting you experience the deep bond between the sisters like never before.\" While two later games in the series, Maiden of Black Water and Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, have made it to PC previously, this is the first time one of the well-received original trilogy will be officially represented on our platform of choice. It's reportedly the scariest one in the whole series too. Fatal Frame, known as Project Zero in some territories, is about ghosts who can be hurt by taking photos of them. Keep…",

While the series stalled after the third game, is 2x2 actually going to equal Dangonronpa 4?

New victims, new culprits, and brand-new tricks await.

Their most powerful skill is Hypnotic Gaze, which lets them strip opponents of their tackle zones and prevent them using skills like block and dodge. It works on a 2+, rather than 3+ under the old rules in Blood Bowl 2, though it's modified by -1 for each marking player. Hypnotic Gaze is a great way of bypassing blockers and busting cages, but it's balanced by the Bloodlust rule. Every bloodsucker has to pass a test before they act, and if they fail they bite someone else on your team—which is why the handful of useful vampire players have to be bulked out with a mob of thralls who exist just to be snacked on. Playing as the Vampires can be infuriating, as a few bad Bloodlust rolls will see you injuring your own players faster than your opponent can (there's no armor roll for your thralls when they get bit).

Not that they're good, certainly—they usually aren't, with a handful of begrudging exceptions. Nor that they're particularly faithful to or even respectful of the series we love, most of the time. But we can definitely say that they exist. In other words, they are undeniably a part of this great tapestry we call gaming, and we can't just dismiss them. Hide in ignorance, and you're liable to be ambushed by a new Resident Evil movie at an inopportune time—most embarrassing. (Image credit: Warner Bros. / Mojang) In fact, I think it's time we all brushed up on our knowledge of some of Hollywood's least favoured children, which is why I've put together a quiz covering the full breadth of videogame movies. Give it a try, and see how much trivia about movies you didn't actually like has stuck in your brain over the years. Let us know how you did—and tell us your favourite (or least favourite) videogame movie—in the comments below!",
