Both devices are expected to feature similarly sized interior displays with near identical shapes, distinguished only by sharper corners on the Samsung model versus rounder ones on Apple’s iteration. Both the Samsung Wide Fold and the foldable iPhone are expected to debut in the fall of 2026, competing head-to-head. Samsung has long been rumored to be working on a wide-screen foldable , potentially as a preemptive response to Apple’s upcoming iPhone Fold . Since Apple is reportedly adopting a wider cover display , even Samsung plans to join the fray, despite pioneering taller cover displays with the Galaxy Z Fold lineup. If you’re wondering how the two upcoming foldables would pan out and compete, we now have new renders that showcase more of what to expect from Samsung and Apple’s wide-screen foldables.

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

    "body": "Credit: Xiaomi on Weibo TL;DR Xiaomi has teased the upcoming launch of the Xiaomi 17 Ultra Leica Edition, featuring a “Master Zoom Ring,” a physical rotary ring surrounding its rear camera module. The flagship device features impressive hardware, including a continuous periscope zoom camera that ranges from 75mm to 100mm (~3.1x to ~4.1x). Leaked information suggests that the rotary mechanism may adjust optically variable zoom levels and includes aesthetic cues, such as custom watermarks and red Leica engraving. Xiaomi is gearing up to launch the Xiaomi 17 Ultra flagship on December 25, promising great specifications for its top-of-the-line smartphone experience. The company just revealed the design of the phone this week, and it was admittedly disappointing to see the company shed its camera-centric aesthetic with the new phone. However, it appears there is more to the story, as the company has now teased the Xiaomi 17 Ultra Leica Edition, which may feature a rotary ring on the rear camera.

After eight days of frequent livestreaming, the Galaxy Z TriFold’s hinge appears to have lost its rigidity. The inner display, however, continues to work even after 160,000 folds. It’s been over a week since a group of Korean YouTubers set out on a mission to put the recently launched Galaxy Z TriFold through a relentless stress test. Over the past seven days, the group has been livestreaming while folding the two hinges on the TriFold to test their durability. Yesterday was Day 8, and the group put out another three-plus hours of livestream, continuing the tiring endeavor of folding and unfolding the phone repeatedly. And while my nonextant grasp of the Korean language prevents me from understanding the banter, watching them go on is definitely satisfying. As in previous videos, they have also noted key moments, such as the onset of creaking noises from the hinge.",

While the OS supports individual, PIN-protected user profiles to keep data separate, it currently lacks a way to lock specific apps. This creates a privacy loophole: If you unlock your profile just to let a passenger play music, they also gain access to all your other apps. Fortunately, that is set to change, as Google is introducing a native App Lock feature to Android Automotive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Other incentives are also available, including a student discount and trade-in bonuses. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the company’s latest midrange tablet. We liked the $400 slate quite a bit; in our review, Ryan said that the Pad Go 2 “might be Android’s best answer to the entry-level iPad.” The tablet launched in many countries last week, but the US missed out. Now, OnePlus tells us, the Pad Go 2 is available to order stateside, and it even comes with some decent perks. Starting today, customers in the US can order the OnePlus Pad Go 2 from OnePlus’s web store for $399.99.

These failures may happen after shooting a large number of photos in a short period of time. It’s not clear how widespread this issue is. We’ve reached out to Google for comment. Some Pixel phones are exhibiting strange behavior that’s been causing people to lose their photos. A handful of Reddit users have posted recently that pictures taken on their Pixel phones got “lost,” not appearing in local storage or backed up in Google Photos. A couple of months back, user Blazgamer posted on the r/GooglePixel subreddit that photos they’d taken on a trip failed to appear Pixel 9. Earlier today, user portmafia9719 described a similar experience on Pixel 10 Pro . It’s not clear what’s happening to these photos, but a common thread seems to be that the pictures turned up missing after a lingering notification that said photos were being processed in the background.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Total Wireless is introducing postpaid-style free phone promotions and EIP device financing to the prepaid space. The catch is a 24-month repayment agreement tied to bill credits, effectively locking customers in long-term. It’s convenient upfront, but buying a phone outright can still be cheaper and more freeing, if you can afford it. All three major postpaid carriers are known for offering free phone promotions to new customers, so you don’t need to pay for a device up front. In reality, these “free” phones often cost much more in the long run than you would pay if you bought a phone outright and paired it with prepaid service. Still, many people would rather pay more over time than come up with a larger amount all at once. Until now, this practice was mostly unheard of in the prepaid world, but that’s beginning to change with Total Wireless . Not only is the company introducing a free phone offer that works similarly to those from the larger carriers, but it will also now offer comparable device repayment plans.",

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort.

Initially, I thought I would use this all the time, but I soon realized that the issue was with the multi-window mode itself, and how it displayed a tiny part of both apps and made using either of them clunkier.

The Galaxy A37 could get a welcome main camera upgrade but retain similar secondary cameras. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A57 might not deliver camera hardware upgrades. The Galaxy A36 and Galaxy A56 led the mid-range charge for Samsung in 2025, but we’ve already heard a few leaks about the Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57. The latest leak has just outlined apparent camera specs. SmartPrix dug into leaked software and discovered purported camera details for the Galaxy A57 and Galaxy A37. Starting with the A57, the new phone is tipped to arrive with a Sony IMX906 main camera (50MP, 1/1.56-inch), a 13MP ISOCELL S5K3L6 ultrawide shooter, and a 5MP macro camera. The outlet explains that some regions might get the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ main camera instead, which has the same sensor size as the IMX906. A 12MP sensor (ISOCELL S5K3LC) will apparently handle selfies and video calls.",

As far back as the late 1950s, there were primitive numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that could produce an accurate (or what a forecaster would call “skillful”) forecast given a set of initial conditions. However, the data available to provide those initial conditions at that time were limited. For example, the weather balloon network circa 1960 only covered about 10% of the troposphere and did not extend into the Southern Hemisphere, the tropics, or over the ocean. Weather forecasters of the pre-satellite era typically relied upon manual analysis of plotted weather maps, cloud observations, and barometric pressure readings when ma…",

Update, December 22, 2025 (2:12 PM ET): Sure enough, those “appliance” vibes we were getting from the teaser video appear to be spot on. Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",

The change was quietly announced this morning by Google in a help forum post. Now, if you have Face Groups enabled, both Ask Photos and the app’s “classic search” feature prominently display a row of faces. Tapping any of the pictures in that row will take you to all the photos you have of that person or pet.

    "body": "Credit: X/@Retroid0fficial TL;DR Retroid has ended the Pocket 6’s Early Bird pricing early, citing soaring RAM costs and a global memory shortage. Existing pre-orders are unaffected, with shipping still planned for early January and March. The move follows similar RAM-related issues affecting rivals like AYN, indicating an industry-wide problem for Android gaming handhelds. Early-bird pricing doesn’t usually disappear mid-preorder, but that’s what’s just happened with the Retroid Pocket 6. In a not-unfamiliar state of affairs for the industry, the company confirmed that it ended the RP6’s discounted pre-order pricing earlier than planned, citing a sharp increase in RAM costs. In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

It’s primarily tasked with mirroring phone functionality and information to the dashboards of supported cars. The intention is to make drivers’ lives a little easier, giving them quick access to contacts for calls and messages, music controls, and navigation information. However, for those of us who spend plenty of time waiting in the car, there’s one feature that’s seemingly missing from this list: video playback. The concept is simple: my car has a screen, so surely I should be able to watch a video on it. While it is technically possible, it comes with strict and awkward limitations.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .
