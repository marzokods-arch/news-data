Ah well, I tried.

Much of that arises from the perceived likelihood of a less-than-ideal long-term outcome for EA, its creative output, and its staff—but some elements of the US government are also uncertain about the whole thing for different reasons: In a letter to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren expressed \" profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks \" that could result from the takeover. \"The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF's reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government,\" the letter states, all but explicitly pointing the finger at longstanding allegations of \"sportswashing\" being conducted by Saudi Arabia via millions of dollars invested in sports, videogames, and \"other cultural institutions.\" Arguing that these deals aren't just about money, \"they are about influence,\" the senators also n…",

I spawned on top of a small castle and picked up some sticks and planks that were lying around, which told me there was crafting. I descended a level and battled some skeletons, so hey, there's monsters. I quickly found a forge, so there's smithing, and a cauldron, so there's cooking. Within a couple minutes I had a magic sword that did poison damage, some armor (wooden, but better than nothing), a shield I'd crafted myself, a couple of potions, a bowl of mushroom stew, and a key to unlock a chest full of loot. That's a promising start. And outside the castle I found my first little airship, so there's flying, too. Explore a world dotted with islands (both in the ocean and hovering high above it), battle monsters, gain skills, craft weapons and armor, and build a mobile base on a flying ship?

Lmao. pic.twitter.com/A0k1I32mRd October 15, 2025 In the last 24 hours, clips have started circulating of players able to gain unparalleled verticality with a kind of bug that makes you wonder, \"What was the person who discovered this even doing?\" Typically, standing on a drone in BF6 doesn't achieve much: As soon as its controller moves it, you'll slide off. But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing.

While I'll admit that last bit isn't often acknowledged by historical consensus, it is the basis for Tears of Metal, an upcoming hack-and-slash roguelike with a playable demo on Steam .

Today I'm going to put your brains and fingers to the test with our biggest quiz yet, and this one is all about game genres. According to the list I've pulled from Steamworks and SteamDB, there are over 130 different game genres and sub-genres that have their own tags on Steam.

They're in alphabetical order, which may help, and you can click the hint button if you want some clues. The concept of a genre, and Steam tags in general, can be a bit nebulous, and there are gonna be certain tags you might expect that aren't on the list, like \"VR\" or \"Cozy\" or \"Adult\"—which all sorta feel like they should be genres but are maybe more descriptors.

It's not until they start running the other way that you realise that their gamer tag isn't quite spelt right, and they never responded to your desperate cries asking what they were doing. The Invasion game mode basically takes these encounters and intensifies them, putting real players into each trial rather than NPCs.

Specs-wise, other than the simple fact that the new GPU, codenamed Crescent Island, is using that next-gen Xe3P technology, there's little to go on. The only other detail is 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. Actually, that's a relatively revealing spec as it implies this GPU will be a value play, at least in the context of megabucks AI chips. Were it aiming at top-tier AI performance, it would more likely use something along the lines of HBM or High Bandwidth Memory over a huge memory bus. Notably, there's no mention at all of Celestial, the graphics architecture that was supposed to follow Intel's current Battlemage tech , which was previously presented under the Xe3 brand and was equally absent from the Panther Lake launch , despite that chip getting Xe3 graphics.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",

Forgive the Destiny jargon, because this thing loves an in-game currency, but unstable cores are how you infuse gear, increasing its power level beyond the seasonal cap. The problem with the currency was relatively simple though, to the extent you wonder how it ever released in this state: it cost huge amounts of cores to do more or less anything at higher levels, compared to the small amount you'd earn for dismantling loot. Anyone still playing Destiny 2, it's fair to say, is probably also running multiple builds, and so the problems with unstable cores quickly became exponential: the higher level infusions could add up to tens of thousands of cores. Bungie is now taking the opportunity, with the release of Destiny 2: Renegades on December 2, to correct its mistake. Having previously said it intended to \"rebalance the economy\" of unstable cores, it's now just admitting this was a bad idea all along. \"We have landed on a plan to fully deprecate this currency,\" says Bungie . \"Once deprecated, infusion…",

After setting a release window of winter 2025 earlier this year, developer Chucklefish now says it needs more time to get things done, and that means a launch sometime in 2026. “Despite great development progress this year, we’ve made the difficult decision to shift the release into next year,” Chucklefish wrote in a development update . “Witchbrook is a big project—and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog , we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.” Along with the usual bustle of getting things ready —bug fixes, polish, that sort of thing—Chucklefish says the added development time “has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned.” Details on that will be rev…",

When said lawyer opposed the claims, they were then accused of defending their use of AI with, well, AI (via 404 Media ).

The Humbird 3 , as it is known, claims to be the world's first eGPU dock with Thunderbolt 5 support. That's critical, because Thunderbolt 5 offers 80 Gbps bi-directional bandwidth plus a 120 Gbps one-way \"Boost\" mode, the latter being designed to support multiple really high-res and high-refresh displays. So, the first question is, will Thunderbolt 5 and 80 Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth be enough to keep a modern GPU fed? After all, if it is, you could then turn any laptop with a Thunderbolt 5 port into a gaming machine. Er, right? That's actually a tricky question. The problem with eGPUs isn't just pure bandwidth; it's latency, too. The Humbird 3 has a full PCIe x16 slot for graphics cards, but it can't do the full x16 bandwidth by PCIe Gen 4 standards, let alone Gen 5.

This patch applies regardless, though. The latest patch includes fixes for zero-day exploits including privilege escalation, secure boot bypass, memory corruption, and TPM information retrieval.

Well, imagine how scandalised I was when I learnt that not only do people prefer to play these sorts of games that way, but that contingent is sizeable enough to alter Obsidian's thinking when it comes to The Outer Worlds 2 . Chatting to Game Informer , game director Brandon Adler says a desire from fans made the studio revise its plans to stay strictly first-person. \"About halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it,\" said Adler. That puts third-person in rare company. Adler says that, for many of the ideas that devs wanted to implement, the studio stayed strikingly sober: \"You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one.'\" Obsidian did not, in fact, make the game's third-person sicko mode itself…",

It then became my secondary monitor when I got another Acer 27-inch 4K IPS screen , about seven years ago, this time with a 144 Hz refresh rate. The difference between the two was night and day, quite literally, as the older one's backlights were beginning to fade. Then, near the beginning of this year, I got my hands on the best OLED gaming monitor around, the MSI MPG 321URX . That's a 32-inch 4K display, with a 240 Hz refresh rate. Compared to the 4K 144 Hz Acer, it's notably better to work on and game with for many hours, and against the ancient 4K 60 Hz Acer, there's just no contest at all. If you're thinking about upgrading your display to an OLED, and you're currently using similarly old monitors, then you'll feel the same way as I did.

By way of example, OpenAI alone (yeah, it's always OpenAI) has signed a deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for fully 900,000 DRAM wafers per month, which is equivalent to 40% of current global DRAM output .

    "body": "Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was a big deal back in 2002. Its cinematic take on World War II, and especially the Omaha Beach landing, earned it our Best Action Game of the Year award, and made it one of 2002's must-play games. The third in the Medal of Honor series, it had been farmed out to a new developer called 2015, Inc. Publisher Electronic Arts decided not to keep 2015 on for the inevitable follow-up, however, bringing the series in-house. Which left 2015 at a loose end. Having been given a tight deadline to crank out a franchise entry and then absolutely smashing it, the studio assumed it would be allowed a second chance. When EA decided not to keep them around, a chunk of 2015 including Allied Assault's development director Vince Zampella went to EA's rival Activision, started a new studio called Infinity Ward, and invented Call of Duty. If EA had kept them around, 2015 would presumably have happily kept making Medal of Honor games for them and Call of Duty wouldn't have become a thing. Or, to put it another way, \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" as Zampella recently told GQ Magazine . It's an incredible own-goal in the history of video…",

I haven't decided yet if that's because they're totally overpowered or if I'm just a dummy, but what I do know is that \"land mine spam\" is real. The current best practice for anti-tank mines, as far as I can tell, is to plaster absolutely every road, junction, and pile of dirt with cylindrical death traps and hope that drivers are too distracted to look out for them. It's working so far: Whether I'm driver, gunner, or a humble passenger, at least half of my tank and jeep escapades have ended with the sudden and frankly terrifying boom of a land mine.

(Image credit: Half Sword Games) Created in consultation with practitioners of Historical European Martial Arts, Half Sword aims for authentic representation of historical weaponry, armor, and techniques from historical combat manuals. And the results of when those hits land are simulated with similar realism, as evidenced by Half Sword's regular dismemberments and disembowelings. In my case, a few of those dismemberments have been self-inflicted.

While some Call of Duty transplants are gobsmacked by the mechanic on principle, DICE is currently investigating instances where bloom is working a little too well. As no shortage of clips shared over the weekend reveal, sometimes guns just decide to be inaccurate at extremely close range , or at the beginning of a magazine when they should still be accurate. But there's a good chance that we're talking about multiple bugs disrupting accuracy, and it's probably not all bloom's fault.

Playing a Splinter Cell game as Sam Fisher, we're more than happy to spend hours slinking slowly through corridors and stairwells, crouching motionless for long minutes in the dark observing enemy patrol routes, and painstakingly carrying unconscious bodies into darkened corners to secrete them. But watching someone do that in an animated series? For 20 minutes at a time? It's hard to imagine that being gripping, which is probably why the stealth sequences in Netflix's animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch don't last all that long before transitioning into straight action.

And worried about Arc more generally. Along with a hill of other information on Panther Lake, Intel published a very confusing slide showing that the new chip's iGPU represents the first outing for its Xe3 graphics architecture. But that slide also indicated that Panther Lake's graphics will be branded \"B Series\", just like the Intel Arc B580 which uses Xe2 technology, otherwise known as (and indeed referred to in the slide in question) as Battlemage.
