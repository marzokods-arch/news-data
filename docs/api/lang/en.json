And in the other, Tame Impala’s long-awaited Deadbeat (Columbia/Sony). When the results were called, Swift’s Showgirl had packed enough glitter to retain the crown, and nab another chart double. The Life Of A Showgirl retains top spot on the ARIA Albums Chart for a third successive week.

Kevin Parker slides in at No. 2 on the national chart with Deadbeat , the first new album release in five years from his psychedelic pop project, Tame Impala. All five of Tame Impala’s studio albums have cracked the top 5 in Australia starting with Innerspeaker (from 2010) and Lonerism ( 2012), both of which peaked at No. 4.
