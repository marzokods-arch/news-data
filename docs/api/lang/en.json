And in all three of those weeks, the same Showgirl song has reigned atop the Hot 100: lead single and album opener “The Fate of Ophelia.” “Ophelia” opened with historic streaming numbers and a gigantic radio debut, posting one of the best all-around single-week performances of any song in 2025, even without being available for single-song purchase in its debut frame.

Friday&#8217;s show will feature a team-up with Anthony Gargiula and Jonathan Tilkin&#8217;s viral Kitchen Singing series in which they reimagine iconic songs with the original artists from their actual kitchen. The pair re-imagine the series as a new competition show called Kitchen Idol with Kelly and Mark, with the duo judging &#8220;contestants&#8221; played by the hosts, who audition by &#8220;borrowing&#8221; their style from trending artists including Roan and Boone.

Search Live might be getting an “Interrupt Live responses” toggle, along with live captions. There’s also a potential new way to add AI Mode to your search, as well as tweaks to Gemini’s image markup tools. Some updates to the Google app are pretty routine, but not this week. We’ve been digging around in the latest beta of the app (version 16.43.60.sa.arm64 beta) and by enabling some internal settings, we’ve spotted a few interesting features in testing. It looks like Google’s laying the groundwork for even more flexibility with its AI experiences, including a smoother way to use Search Live.

Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2. The feature was spotted rolling out to the beta channel last month, and is now also available on the stable channel, as highlighted by 9to5Google .",

This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

    "body": "A smartphone can have the best processor, endless amounts of RAM, incredible cameras, and giant batteries. Yet, it’s often the software that truly shapes your overall experience because it’s what we use every day. You probably notice when an app takes a little longer to open, a transition stutters, or a game lags. Bad software can really spoil the experience, which is what vivo is addressing with the latest version of its smartphone OS – OriginOS 6. By harnessing three innovative technologies, vivo is not just making devices run smoothly—they’re redefining what ‘smooth’ really means on smartphones. We spoke with Shi Yujian, Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Technology Officer at vivo, to learn more about how the brand has achieved this remarkable level of fluidity.

A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

One summary said “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” while another labeled a man living alone as “Sarah.” Google provided a statement explaining that it is actively investing to improve the accuracy of facial identification. Update: October 28, 2025 (2:15 PM ET): In response to our original article below, a Google spokesperson reached out to us with the following statement: Gemini for Home (including AI descriptions, Home Brief, and Ask Home) is in early access so users can try these new features and continue giving us feedback as we work to perfect the experience. As part of this, we are investing heavily in improving accurate identification. This includes incorporating user-provided corrections to generate more accurate AI descriptions. Since all Gemini for Home features rely on our underlying Familiar Faces identification, improving this accuracy also means improving the quality of Familiar Faces. This is an active area of investment and we expect these features to keep improving over time.",

It was less than two weeks ago that we learned the Fairphone 4 would skip Android 14 altogether with a jump straight to Android 15 , and things are moving quickly. Rewarding owners for their patience after last year’s software delay, the company previously stated that the upgrade would start arriving “from early November onwards.” Fairphone seems to be ahead of schedule this time around, with Android 15 already rolling out on the device. A Fairphone employee confirmed on the company’s Community Forum that the phased rollout would begin on October 27, and the update is now reaching some users. It includes the October security patch and weighs in at around 1.6GB, depending on your existing version. The rollout is still phased, so those who haven’t received it yet should expect a notification in the coming days and weeks.",

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR A new leak claims that the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 SoC by Qualcomm will utilize TSMC’s advanced N2P chip process for improved performance and efficiency. It is expected to support LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage, offering significant enhancements over the current 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC. However, continued increases in manufacturing costs may make next-gen flagship phones with this future chip notably pricier. Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the SoC of choice for many next-generation Android flagships . It’s the latest and greatest chip on the block, announced just a few weeks ago. The cycle for new phones has just gotten started with this new SoC, but we’re already seeing leaks appear for its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6.

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority TL;DR A missing font was causing the Pixel Camera app to crash on de-Google’ed operating systems, such as GrapheneOS. Users had to downgrade to an older release of the camera app to use it again. To fix the issue, users on GrapheneOS build v2025102300 and older can install the GmsCompatLib app v100 from the GrapheneOS store. A future GrapheneOS build (v2025102600) will include the Pixel Camera app fix natively, eliminating the need for extra installation. Last week, the Pixel Camera app began crashing on de-Googled aftermarket OS solutions, such as GrapheneOS. If users didn’t have Google Play Services on their device, the Pixel Camera app would either crash or refuse to start. As it turns out, the actual issue was a missing font . Users could roll back to older versions of the Pixel Camera app, but now, the fix is here for GrapheneOS users. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This would be a dramatic and overdue increase in battery capacity for the Z Fold family. The phone is also tipped to offer S Pen support and a reduced display crease. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best foldable phones of 2025, and that’s largely due to its cutting-edge design. However, the Z Fold 7 retains a 4,400mAh battery for the fifth straight generation, while Samsung also nixed S Pen support. There might be good news for the Galaxy Z Fold 8, though. Dealsite (via Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could have a battery larger than 5,000mAh. This would be much bigger than the Z Fold 7’s 4,400mAh battery.",

Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
