During the opening number, their 1987 hit “Welcome to the Jungle” at Estadio Huracán, Rose was visibly frustrated, kicking the bass drum, hurling his microphone toward the kit, and storming offstage after stripping off his leather jacket. The abrupt departure stunned the crowd, prompting confusion both in the audience and among his bandmates. Minutes later, Rose returned to the stage and addressed the situation with a terse, “So, I’ll just try and wing this,” before continuing the set. On Tuesday (Oct. 22), the band released a statement via social media explaining the cause of the disruption.
