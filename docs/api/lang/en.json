The Perth venue takes top honors in the seventh edition of the fan-voted 2025 Stadium Awards , organized by Austadiums, the online resource for Australian and New Zealand venues and events. Optus Stadium secured 27.5% of the public vote, narrowly beating Adelaide Oval (23%) and Brisbane&#8217;s Suncorp Stadium (18.2%). The venue’s “continued success comes off another major year hosting high-profile AFL matches, international cricket, concerts, and special events,” reads a statement from Austadiums . “Its riverfront location, modern design, and strong match-day atmosphere continue to resonate with fans nationwide.” Opening in January 2018, Optus Stadium has a&nbsp;standard seating capacity of 60,000, making it the country’s third-largest stadium, though the venue can be reconfigured to hold up to 65,000 for rectangular field sports, like soccer and rugby, and more for concerts, lifting to 70,000 or more with temporary seating. It’s owned by the Western Australian state government and operated by VenuesLive. Optus Stadiu…",

But since I began my search thousands of miles away, I had to do all of my due diligence based on these photos alone. This is not a problem isolated to Facebook Marketplace either. AI-generated images and videos have quickly proliferated across all online platforms. Over the past month alone, I’ve seen several supposed leaked photos of upcoming movies like Avengers: Doomsday that were, in fact, AI-generated.",

It doubles as a Bluetooth speaker with dynamic RGB lighting that syncs to your music and AI interactions. Most charging stations are basically power strips we hide behind our monitors. They do their job, but they’re not exactly exciting. PISEN, a consumer electronics company from Shenzhen, wants to change that at CES 2026 with a device designed to be the centerpiece of your desktop.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section. It’s alright if you never bothered to check these…",

The phone is also tipped to have a 6.3-inch 165Hz screen, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, and a 50MP tele camera. The OnePlus 13S/13T had a very limited release, but we hope the new phone is widely available. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 13T in China last year, which was known as the OnePlus 13s in India. This was a pocket-friendly phone with flagship performance and a big battery. Now, a prominent leaker has revealed apparent details for the OnePlus 15T. Leaker Digital Chat Station posted purported OnePlus 15T specs on Weibo. For one, the device is said to have a flat 6.3-inch 165Hz screen (1.5K resolution). This screen size would be roughly on par with the OnePlus 13T/13S while offering a higher refresh rate.",

At CES 2026, the company confirmed the shortage is already raising costs and admitted it’s actively considering repricing products to match the new reality. DRAM and storage power everything from phones to fridges, but AI servers are buying it in bulk, leaving less for consumer devices. Samsung just issued a warning that’s hard to miss. The huge demand for memory chips — driven by AI data center buildouts — is squeezing supplies so tightly that prices across the electronics world are set to climb. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Samsung’s global marketing head, Wonjin Lee, made it clear that shortages in memory supply are real, and they’re already nudging costs upward, Bloomberg reports. While the company doesn’t want to pass those costs straight to shoppers, Lee admitted that Samsung is starting to consider “repricing” its products to reflect the new economics.",

The vulnerability can be used to trigger a zero-click attack on Android using an audio file. While the issue was fixed on Pixel devices last month, we’re still waiting for Google to fix other Pixel bugs, which should have been addressed in a separate Pixel Update for January. Google has freshly released the Android Security Bulletin for January 2026, listing a critical vulnerability that will be addressed in security updates. The list isn’t quite as long as the December 2025 bulletin , and that is because Google recently moved to publicly disclose a large chunk of security issues in Android on a quarterly basis rather than every month . In fact, the only critical vulnerability listed in the bulletin relates to the Dolby Digital Plus Codec , which is used for playing audio files on Android. As per Wiz , the vulnerability can allow hackers to manipulate the extra information, also known as evolution data, added to the audio file, which can force the player to crash on a broad range of devices.

A spokesperson for the major music company shared with Billboard a brief statement that reads, “We can confirm that Dean Lewis is no longer signed to Universal Music Australia or any Universal Music Group label.” The split comes after multiple women turned to TikTok in the back-end of 2025, to address Lewis’ alleged inappropriate behavior with fans online. The “Be Alright” singer responded by yanking his nominations for the ARIA and TikTok Awards, and by sharing a seven-slide apology on Instagram . “In the past few days,” he wrote in the post, published Oct. 30, “social media has made public a decade-plus of private conversations with a number of women, all of adult age.” He continued, “from the bottom of my heart, I want to sincerely apologise to those I’ve hurt. This is not only an apology to the women who have spoken up, but those who haven’t and felt hurt by my words or behavior. I also need to apologise to my family and fans who I’ve gravely disappointed.” The 38-year-old Sydneysider also assured he would make “a lot of changes,” and accept a “…",

Starting this year, however, Google is making a major change to its release schedule for Android source code drops: AOSP sources will only be released twice a year. Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4.

The tech offers the flexibility of digital art without the glow, noise, or constant power draw of a traditional screen.

Razer is pitching headphones as a new way to control AI, offering environmental awareness and support for major AI platforms, though it remains a concept with no product plans confirmed. Razer also showcased new AI-focused accessories at the event, including the Wolverine V3 BT controller designed for ultra-low-latency gaming on compatible LG TVs. Razer is no stranger to showing off cool concept ideas at trade shows like CES , including stuff like a high-tech facemask and a climate-controlled chair . This year, the company has something equally innovative to share in the form of Project Motoko. At first glance, you’d assume that these were simply a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but underneath you’ll find an incredible amount of AI-powered smarts.

Instead of offering carefully chosen recommendations , the service is apparently showing more AI-generated tracks that listeners never wanted, and even long-time subscribers are getting frustrated. The complaints have been piling up on Reddit , where a YouTube Music user said their recommendations are being flooded with AI slop (via PiunikaWeb ). These tracks usually come from unknown artists with huge catalogs and generic titles. The user said much of their recommended playlists are now filled with this content.",

In addition to the already-leaked black and white colorways, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro may also come in an “Apricot” colorway. The special color appears limited to the Pro variant for now, with no hints for the regular model. Unlike its phones, which get updated every year, Samsung maintains a longer upgrade cycle for its premium wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 3 series was released nearly 18 months ago, which means the Galaxy Buds 4 should arrive soon. Although we aren’t clear on the timeline just yet, we’ve been seeing several references to the Galaxy Buds 4 and the Buds 4 Pro in Samsung’s One UI firmware for phones. While we recently learned about changes to the earbuds’ battery capacities and new head gestures , the recently released One UI 8.5 beta 3 provides more details.
