    "body": "How do you turn hype into a lasting music career? On Monday (Oct. 20), rising Puerto Rican star Matt Louis joined forces with executive producers of Slow Jamz, Oscar Ortiz and Jean Viana, as well as producer Siggy Vazquez to unpack the secrets behind building artists who don’t just trend, but thrive. Moderated by screenwriter and journalist Juan J. Arroyo and presented by SONAR, the &#8220;Breaking a New Artist: Building a Career Beyond the Hype&#8221; panel at Billboard Latin Music Week offered both an insider blueprint and a motivational kickstart for aspiring music industry professionals. Matt Louis — who appeared on Billboard ’s On the Radar in August — highlighted the importance of preserving authenticity amid the speed of the industry and the impact of social media. “When I started my project, the idea [was always] to be authentic, to put out a good product, an original image — and not rely on a mood board,” said Louis. The artist, who focuses on building a genuine identity as the foundation of his career, also added that often in music, “authenticity is something that gets diluted a lot with the speed of the industry.” “The industry should be concerned about the health of i…",

The app’s also working on a couple more Expressive updates, including a new loading indicator. Card UI may also be updated to move text away from graphics. Material 3 Expressive finally landed in full force last month, and based on your feedback, the changes it implements are well appreciated. But as we’ve seen this past summer, Expressive revamps to existing Android apps haven’t been hitting all at once, and Google continues to whittle away at them. Right now we’ve spotted some new tweaks to one of the company’s apps, and some hints at what could be changing next.

This time, the BMO Stadium run on Thursday (Oct. 16) and Friday (Oct. 17) nights was lighter two additional members, with Hoshi, Woozi and Wonwoo joining Jeonghan in completing their mandatory South Korean military service; Jun, who sat out the previous tour to support his acting career, meanwhile, took the stage once again after nearly three long years away from the city. Even though the chaos was slightly more controlled with fewer faces — the improvised banter certainly felt shorter — the guys of SEVENTEEN are never ones to simply follow a script. As such, there were far too many surprises to count: “I think, at this rate, we’re not going to be able to perform the songs we did prepare,” Seungkwan quipped following one timeout from their real setlist to take fan requests. (To think, there was a world where DK’s casually perfect high notes in &#8220;Rock,&#8221; formally cut from the U.S. leg of the tour, went unheard.)

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm’s powerful new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip unfortunately doesn’t support Android’s new Linux Terminal feature. This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

    "body": "Credit: Amazon TL;DR Amazon updated its Kindle Colorsoft FAQs with a candid disclaimer. The company says that black-and-white Kindles, like the Paperwhite, offer crisper text. Colorsoft screens still suit comics and PDFs, but trade sharpness for color. Update: October 20, 2025 (12:25 PM ET): Following the publication of the original article below, Amazon contacted us to highlight an amendment to the FAQ section on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. In response to the question “How is the reading experience different on Kindle Colorsoft than on Kindle Paperwhite?” the answer now reads “The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display, and includes a fully optimized display stack to deliver high quality color reading. The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard. The new FAQ answer removes this part to avoid such confusion and makes clear that the resolution o…",

Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

For example, Nothing recently rolled out the Nothing OS 4.0 beta , which is based on Android 16. This beta is only available for the Phone 2, Phone 2a, Phone 2a Pro, Phone 3, and eventually the Phone 3a. However, it appears a developer may have found a way to get the OS running on a Phone 1.

    "body": "TL;DR OnePlus has detailed its upcoming OxygenOS 16 update. A head-to-head comparison with Samsung One UI was meant to show that OnePlus’s software is more respsonsive. Closer viewing shows One UI failed to keep pace largely due to user error. OnePlus’s latest OxygenOS 16 update is set to begin rolling out broadly next month . The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

When Google launched the Pixel 10 series, it also debuted a conversational editing feature for the Photos app. Conversational editing is a Gemini-powered feature that allows you to edit images simply by entering a text or voice prompt. Last month, Google expanded the feature so other Android users in the US could begin trying it out. Although it’s now available on more Android devices, it’s still missing for users in two states.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile is reportedly running a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer (Promo R339) that began on October 2 and includes many older Android and iPhone models. The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark. Thankfully, every once in a while, an offer comes along that even older plans like Simple Choice can take advantage of. According to several users on Reddit , some have been able to get in on a new $830 “any condition” trade-in offer.",
