They’ll provide mental-health care for millions, unimpeded by the pesky requirements for human counselors, like the need for graduate degrees, malpractice insurance, and sleep. Down here on Earth, something very different has been happening.&nbsp; Last week, we published a story about people finding out that their therapists were secretly using ChatGPT during sessions. In some cases it wasn’t subtle; one therapist accidentally shared his screen during a virtual appointment, allowing the patient to see his own private thoughts being typed into ChatGPT in real time. The model then suggested responses that his therapist parroted.&nbsp; It’s my favorite AI story as of late, probably because it captures so well the chaos that can unfold when people actually use AI the way tech companies have all but told them to. As the writer of the story, Laurie Clarke, points out, it’s not a total pipe dream that AI could be therapeutically useful. Early this year, I wrote about the first clinical trial of an AI bot built specifically for therapy. The results were promising! But the secretive use by t…",

We pestered Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft, but each company refused to provide its figure.

We’ve just published the 2025 edition . This year, though, the context is pointedly different: The US scientific community finds itself in an unprecedented position, with the very foundation of its work under attack .&nbsp; Since Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has fired top government scientists , targeted universities individually and academia more broadly , and made substantial funding cuts to the country’s science and technology infrastructure . It has also upended longstanding rights and norms related to free speech, civil rights, and immigration—all of which further affects the overall environment for research and innovation in science and technology.&nbsp; We wanted to understand how these changes are affecting the careers and work of our most recent classes of innovators.

To be treated properly, they must first get diagnoses—which means having their genomes sequenced. This process typically takes up to seven weeks. Sadly, that’s often too slow to save a critically ill child. Hospitals may soon have a faster option, thanks to a groundbreaking system built in part by Sneha Goenka , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton—and MIT Technology Review ’s 2025 Innovator of the Year.&nbsp; Five years ago, Goenka and her colleagues designed a rapid-sequencing pipeline that can provide a genetic diagnosis in less than eight hours. Goenka’s software computations and hardware architectures were critical to speeding up each stage of the process.&nbsp; “Her work made everyone realize that genome sequencing is not only for research and medical application in the future but can have immediate impact on patient care,” says Jeroen de Ridder , a professor at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, who has developed an ultrafast se…",
