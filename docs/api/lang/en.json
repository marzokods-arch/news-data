    "body": "A wave of Latin artists took over the 2025 Premios Juventud that were hosted in Panama City on Thursday night (Sept. 25), marking the first time the awards were presented outside the United States. Coinciding with Hispanic Heritage Month and under the theme “evolving to the rhythm of music,” this year’s move “reinforces TelevisaUnivision’s commitment to honoring the strength, values and traditions of Latin American communities,” according to a statement shared with Billboard. Bad Bunny and Danny Ocean lead this year’s nominations with six nods each, followed by the five-time nominees Anitta, Beéle, Carín León, Emilia, Myke Towers, Netón Vega and Peso Pluma. Traditionally, the nominations salute today’s youth in music, television, social media, streaming and pop culture with an eligibility period from May 31, 2024, to June 1, 2025, and the winners are determined by popular vote. Meanwhile, Carlos Vives and Myke Towers were recognized as this year&#8217;s Agents of Change.

The weather more than cooperated, with sunshine and warm winds blowing off San Francisco Bay and onto the approximately 40,000 people gathered for each of the event&#8217;s two days. This year marked the fourth edition of the event, which more or less adopted an if-it&#8217;s-not-broke-don&#8217;t-fix-it ethos by keeping most every stage in the same position as years past. The only major visible changes were an expanded ultra-VIP viewing area at the main stage and more lights and speakers in the festival&#8217;s massive warehouse space, which, despite being built almost entirely from metal, offered a pristine sound experience.

The lawsuit, filed by L.A. litigator Konrad Trope , accuses the building&#8217;s management company, ASM Global, along with Ticketmaster, Live Nation and the City of Los Angeles of orchestrating a corrupt system that shuts out independent promoters and leaves fans — particularly seniors — without access to concerts at the venue. At the heart of the complaint is a claim that city officials and corporate partners have quietly undermined the Greek Theatre’s 2018 management agreement, which mandated the venue be run as an “open building” free from exclusive ticketing and promotion deals. Instead, Trident alleges that the city, in partnership with Ticketmaster and Live Nation, allowed a de facto monopoly over the venue, forcing promoters into arrangements that stifled competition and limited access for fans.

    "body": "4 min read Preparations for Next Moonwalk Simulations Underway (and Underwater) Recent airborne science flights to Greenland are improving NASA’s understanding of space weather by measuring radiation exposure to air travelers and validating global radiation maps used in flight path planning. This unique data also has value beyond the Earth as a celestial roadmap for using the same instrumentation to monitor radiation levels for travelers entering Mars’ atmosphere and for upcoming lunar exploration. NASA’s Space Weather Aviation Radiation (SWXRAD) aircraft flight campaign took place August 25-28 and conducted two five-hour flights in Nuuk, Greenland. Based out of NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the mission gathered dosimetry measurements, or the radiation dose level, to air travelers from cosmic radiation. Cosmic radiation is caused by high-energy particles from outer space that originate from our Sun during eruptive events like solar flares and from events farther away, like supernovae in our Milky Way galaxy and beyond.

    "body": "Credit: Kaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority TL;DR Amazon’s latest Kindle update makes it almost impossible to remove DRM from newly downloaded e-books. A jailbreak specialist says the e-books are now tied to a hidden “account secret” only accessible with a previously jailbroken device. It follows earlier restrictions like removing USB transfers and blocking downloads on older versions of the Kindle Android app. Amazon just rolled out a change to its Kindle e-readers that could frustrate anyone who likes to keep permanent copies of their e-books . The newest firmware update, version 5.18.5, strengthens Amazon’s Digital Rights Management (DRM) — the copy-protection system that prevents people from freely backing up or transferring Kindle books. Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method. In the poster’s explanation, they said the new system applies fresh encryption to any newly downloaded e-books, regardless of when they were originally purchased or published. Books where the publisher has opted out of copy-protection are not affected.",

So far, all you’ve needed to activate it was your phone number — so anyone who knew it could potentially lock your phone. That’s now slightly more secure with the addition of an optional security question. Google offers plenty of automatic ways to try and limit your exposure when someone takes off with your smartphone. Features like Theft Detection use sensors to know when a thief grabs your phone and makes a break for it, while Offline Device Lock prevents a thief from using a lack of connectivity to give them more time with an unlocked handset. Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools. And if you’re using 2FA like you should, signing into a new device without your phone could be a little tricky.

It’s selling for $199 at Verizon, and will soon be available at Total Wireless. If you’re looking for a budget-level tablet, there are plenty of options to choose from. TCL’s tablets, in particular, stand out from the rest of the crowd due to the company’s innovative NXTPAPER tech. It’s a smooth, textured display that feels a lot like paper and offers a few benefits, like reducing eye strain and not attracting fingerprints. Earlier this year, TCL debuted the next generation of this display, NXTPAPER 4.0 , with the NXTPAPER 11 Plus. Now the manufacturer is putting this tech in a new tablet that’s even more affordable. Today, TCL announced the launch of a compact tablet called the TAB 8 NXTPAPER 5G. As mentioned earlier, this device features an NXTPAPER 4.0 display. That screen measures 8.7 inches and has a resolution of 800 x 1,340.

AI music creators, like Suno AI , are on the rise. And with that surge in popularity, streaming services, like Spotify, are getting bogged down by increasing levels of AI-generated content. Whether the music is passible or just pure spam, the presence of this content is having an effect on the experience. Now Spotify is starting to take steps to address the problem. Today, Spotify announced it is rolling out new policies and tools to fight off spammy AI content.

The feature works through the Call Assist menu, with playback, sharing, and deletion options in the Phone app. Call recording is available on the Pixel 6 and later in supported regions, though we’ve seen little evidence of it outside of India so far. We’ve already heard a lot about how Pixel phones are finally getting native call recording support , but until now, we hadn’t seen the feature in action. Thanks to a new screen recording from a Pixel 8 Pro user in India, we can show you exactly how it works. The video, shared with us by Sameer on Telegram, was captured on a Pixel 8 Pro running Android 16 QPR1 stable with the beta version of the Phone app (193.0.809761572-publicbeta). It shows how the feature looks and behaves during an actual call. Check it out below.",

    "body": "TL;DR The iPhone 17 Pro is prone to scratching around its camera bump. JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson says the problem is caused by thin anodization over sharp edges. Apple maintains its anodization process exceeds industry standards. Apple’s latest phones hit store shelves last week, and the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max are all available for purchase right now. The iPhone 17 series features some striking new designs, but early testing has revealed an issue: several of the new models seem especially prone to scratching in certain areas. Apple’s now acknowledged the problem, but its response probably won’t do much to soothe affected buyers. About five minutes into JerryRigEverything ‘s iPhone 17 Pro durability test video, the channel’s Zack Nelson clearly demonstrates the issue. While the 17 Pro’s anodized aluminum finish is mostly able to resist scratching when rubbed with a coin, the finish gives way around the sharp edges of the phone’s new camera plateau. Zack says this is down to a confluence of thin anodization applied over a sharp corner, making for an especially vulnerable finish in that area.",

It’s a controversial opinion, I know, but I’m going to say it anyway: I’m glad Google Pixel phones don’t use Snapdragon processors . Let me start my defense with a little analogy. Imagine that you’re in the market for a new vehicle. Your goal is to take your family on long road trips, exploring national parks and camping under the stars. You need space for people, beds, and maybe even a small kitchenette. A tricked-out Sprinter camper van seems like the perfect solution, which would cost you about $150,000. Unfortunately, your friend, a die-hard car enthusiast, scoffs at your choice. “A Sprinter van? Why would you buy that slow thing?” they ask. “For the same amount of money, you could get a Porsche 911! It can go from zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds, bro!”",

A few hours later, as I was browsing Twitter/X, I came across a viral post by one of the developers who worked on the original Space Cadet Windows port from the original Full Tilt! Pinball title. It felt like a sign that I should break my no-games-on-my-phone rule and install this oldie but goodie. I grabbed the Space Cadet Pinball APK , installed it, and was immediately taken back in time to 1999, sitting in front of my first PC, starting Windows 98, and discovering it came with a few games pre-installed. 3D Pinball Space Cadet was one of those games, and it quickly became my go-to time-waster during school holidays and on weekends. Now, more than 25 years later, would I still like it?",

Other upgrades include RGB lighting, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD via an M.2 slot. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is available at a starting price of $200. The Raspberry Pi 400 was an intriguing release back in 2020, as it was the first official Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard. This effectively enabled an all-in-one PC experience. We’ve since seen the Raspberry Pi 500, and now the company has upped the ante with the Raspberry Pi 500 Plus. The Raspberry Pi 500 Plus is indeed a full-fledged Raspberry Pi computer built into a keyboard, but it offers various major upgrades over the Pi 500. For one, we’ve now got a mechanical keyboard with removable keycaps and RGB lighting.",

    "summary": "Though it won't be as effortless as searching with Pixel Screenshots!",
    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a “More like this” feature to search similar-looking images. The results display identical images in a grid, allowing you to easily sort or delete pictures. While results aren’t very accurate currently, we can expect them to mature as the feature nears its release. For most Android users, Google Photos is a great way to store and share photos across multiple devices. However, it also becomes the default dumping ground for unnecessary or unpicturesque, yet still useful, images, which can compound if you tend to keep automatic backups turned on. Finding those images can be challenging, especially if you don’t own a Pixel, which makes the process easier with the Pixel Screenshots app. Thankfully, that may be alleviated to some degree with an upcoming feature update.

The best thing about Nano Banana is that it isn’t locked behind a paywall. It’s available in every country, across personal, work, and paid versions of Gemini, so just about anyone can try it out. Now, it seems Google is preparing to bring the magic of Nano Banana to an even wider audience by building it directly into Google Photos.

The problem is, these interactive elements can get in the way and become distractions. Now, the video platform is finally letting viewers do something about these pesky pop-ups.

YouTube offers probably the deepest video content well in the history of entertainment, and with such a massive library to draw from, not all of that content’s going to be appropriate for everyone. The site has long struggled to take appropriate measures to protect its young and vulnerable users, while still letting adults enjoy more mature material — within reason. Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history. When that fails, or Google’s unable to make a guess with much confidence, YouTube offers these users the opportunity to manually establish their age by submitting something like an…",

Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

Xiaomi’s T series has generally ticked the right boxes for what makes a good smartphone, but it’s always lacked that one extra feature to make it exciting. The new Xiaomi 15T is a great device with solid all-around specs and some welcome generational improvements, like a better telephoto lens, a bigger battery, and a larger display. However, it also breaks from the T series mold by bringing a seldom-seen feature to mobile devices: an offline communication mode that effectively turns your phone into a walkie-talkie.",

I love the idea of my phone greeting me with immediately relevant information before I start my day. And, as it’s made by Google, I could expect all the relevant content from my many Google apps and services to be included, right? Not quite. The early version of Daily Hub was as useful as a wet piece of toast. As a result, the company quickly yanked it to polish it up a bit. This loss didn’t affect me too severely — I don’t own a Pixel 10, but I craved a similar feature, albeit with a few more customizations. So, naturally, to achieve my vision, I turned to Google’s generative AI for assistance. Could I use Gemini to serve me with a Daily Hub equivalent? I gave this idea a whack, and here are my findings.",

The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

This could pave the way for future Chromebooks and even a Pixel Laptop powered by Android. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage . “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”",
