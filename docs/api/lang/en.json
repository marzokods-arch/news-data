    "summary": "This Vintage Almost-Pop Stardom episode of the Greatest Pop Stars podcast looks at the late great D'Angelo's brush with pop culture centrality, and how he immediately recoiled from it.",
    "body": "D&#8217;Angelo had already proven a transformative R&amp;B figure as a 21-year-old with his 1995 debut LP Brown Sugar , scoring hits and winning awards and growing the movement that would ultimately be known as neo-soul. And when his sophomore album Voodoo arrived in 2000, it topped the Billboard 200 — helped by the success of its gorgeous ballad single &#8220;Untitled (How Does It Feel),&#8221; and its nakedly vulnerable (and also just naked) music video —&nbsp;while drawing rave reviews. But instead of marking just the beginning of D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s superstardom, it also marked its end, as he grew wary of the kind of attention the MTV-conquering clip earned him, and ultimately disappeared from music making altogether. This month on the&nbsp; Greatest Pop Stars podcast , our&nbsp; Vintage Pop Stardom &nbsp;spin-off series Vintage Almost-Pop Stardom is welcoming on first-time guests to look at really interesting artists during years in which they brushed up against pop stardom, but perhaps never quite got all the way there. We’ve already discussed&nbsp; 1995 Björk ,&nbsp; 2005 Paul Wall and 2011 Bon Iver , and this week we close with 2000 D&#8217;Angelo, who sadly died at age…",

The 27-year-old artist from Monterrey, Nuevo León released his biggest hit to date, titled &#8220;Triple Lavada&#8221; — which also includes a remix featuring Conriquez, Alemán, Óscar Maydon and Victor Mendivil. The remix &#8212; released in May, two months after the original one &#8212; earned Ortiz his first top 10 on any Billboard chart when the song peaked at No. 9 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. It also peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart and at No. 17 on the Billboard Global 200 chart. The plan was to only release the remix version, not two separate ones. But, he had to pivot quickly when, earlier this year, a part of the song was leaked on TikTok and gained momentum. &#8220;It took time to get everyone on board, so I had to release it on my own, and besides, it had been leaked, so I had to release it right away,&#8221; Ortiz says over Zoom. &#8220;The leaked …",

Sean Haywood created his stage name, Atlus, as a recognition of the pressures that accompany the tough periods in life. “Everyone&#8217;s holding up the world – their own world – and sometimes it wants to crush you,” he explains. “But you still gotta hold it, you know. And sometimes you’re just like, ‘This sucks. I feel like giving up, but I still gotta go do it.’” Atlus knows something of the subject matter – he grew up in a single-parent home in Denver, locked in poverty. And yet, he pushed forward as an adult, doing a series of physical jobs as he attempted to forge a path musically. To date, he’s released three albums, and earned a platinum single with “You’re A F&#8211;king B&#8211;ch Hope You Know That S&#8211;t,” pairing an angry storyline with a casual musical environment. He signed with BBR Music Group/BMG Nashville, launching his country career with “Devil Ain’t Done,” a song that addresses life’s weight in the context of a motivational sound. “It is a little dark,” Atlus concedes. “But it&#8217;s real, it&#8217;s…",

I want you to tell me everything that’s new.” Halpin compiled a 100-page deck, including links to the latest video technology, for the pop superstar to study. Together, they concocted the centerpiece of the 14-month tour, which concluded in July — a massive, five-sided monolith, 17&nbsp;feet by 30&nbsp;feet by 7&nbsp;feet, festooned with tiny LEDs for elaborate videos. At the end of every show, Timberlake surfed atop the giant rectangle, floating above the audience as it displayed gravity-­defying bubbles on every side. “Screens have gotten infinitely lighter. They’ve gotten infinitely cheaper,” says Halpin, founder and CEO of Silent House, a Los Angeles design and production company that has worked with Tyler, The Creator, P!nk, Doja Cat and others. “A lot of things came together to make the process easier and more achievable.” Billboard &#8216;s Live Music Summit will …",

The move continues T-Mobile’s shift away from traditional customer service channels as it consolidates all its functionality under the T-Life app. In the current economy, it’s easy to fall behind on your bills from time to time. The good news is that many utilities offer payment arrangements to help you pay off your overdue balance gradually, including cellular companies like T-Mobile . While you’ll still technically be overdue and subject to extra fees, an arrangement ensures your account won’t be suspended while you work to bring your payment history up to date. For the Un-carrier, there have always been three ways to do this: via the app, in-store, or through a customer support call.

The dual-screen gaming handheld race already has two premium champions in the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , but ANBERNIC’s more budget-friendly RG DS made big waves when it was announced earlier this month . Coming in at under $100, it was always the case that some concessions would need to be made. but a recent spec leak has dampened some of the community’s excitement. A listing from ANBERNIC’s AliExpress storefront was published online, and although it’s since been pulled, it revealed the full specs, size, and more. Starting with the screens, it will feature two 4-inch IPS screens with a resolution of 640×480. That’s a fairly limited resolution for screens this size, but the real issue is that it doesn’t support perfect integer scaling for DS games. Instead, it’s 2.5x, which can lead to some wonky visuals, especially in pixel art games.",

What went under the radar is Google’s continuous work on Panorama mode, which today is absolutely amazing and has finally reached its full potential. I’ve been using my Pixel 10 Pro XL as my main camera for a couple of months, including a short trip to Athens and some sightseeing around France while my parents were visiting.

    "body": "TL;DR Details about Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 (non-Elite variant) have leaked. The chipset is expected to be built on TSMC’s newer N3P fabrication process, which is also used for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. It follows a similar design to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, including Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, but with a lower clock speed than the Elite Gen 5. In addition to launching the top-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 earlier than usual this year, Qualcomm also confirmed it is working on the non-Elite variant of the chipset. The standard Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 has yet to hit the market, but Qualcomm has already shared some specifics about the chipset, including a vague description of the CPU. Now, a recent leak is plugging any previous gap in information with more details. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared specifications for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, including its CPU and GPU . Per the leak, the chipset is set to be fabricated on TSMC’s N3P 3nn process, identical to the Elite edition. This is TSMC’s third-gen 3nm process, which offers marginal gains in performance and efficiency over the N3E process that was utilized for the Snapdragon 8 Elite from last year.",

And yet, with the OnePlus 15 , I find myself feeling rather conflicted. OnePlus did a lot right with the phone, and its commitment to performance, battery, and charging is more evident than ever. But at the same time, OnePlus sacrificed other parts of its identity to the point where I’m not even sure I recognize this as a OnePlus phone.",

While we could keep going for pretty much ever, high on that list would absolutely be “when you’re in the middle of navigating somewhere.” Thankfully, Google Maps could soon offer a new mode for dealing with exactly those kind of emergencies.

Bigme has launched the HiBreak S, a device that blurs the line between smartphone and e-reader, all at an affordable price point. While BOOX’s new Palma 2 Pro looks the part but lacks full voice-calling support, the HiBreak S delivers connectivity and a starting price that makes it the most affordable color E Ink phone to date. The HiBreak S features a 5.84-inch Kaleido 3 color E Ink display, available in both color and black-and-white variants. The panel’s matte finish keeps reflections to a minimum, while a 36-level front light with adjustable color temperature makes it easy to read in any lighting. The E Ink technology naturally favors eye comfort and energy efficiency over motion smoothness, so users should expect crisp text and subdued colors rather than high-refresh visuals.",

Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 software for Galaxy smartphones and tablets is set to bring several significant design changes over the current UI. One of these is a refreshed Quick Settings panel, which is expected to become more dynamic and customizable with this future update. Although One UI 8.5 is likely to arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series — and the beta isn’t coming for the whole of November either, plenty of leaks have given us an overview of these design changes. While a revamped Quick Settings panel has already been spotted in previously leaked builds of One UI 8.5, the latest leak gives us a better look at additional options it could bring.

Devices like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 , both released last year, were designed to connect us directly to AI-powered services without graphical user interfaces getting in the way.

It wasn’t all bad for Verizon, as its prepaid, broadband, and business divisions grew, keeping its finances strong despite postpaid losses. The bigger picture is that T-Mobile is closing the gap on Verizon’s total subscriber count and could surpass it by late 2026 if trends continue. There was a time when Verizon was the undisputed king, both in network power and reach, as well as subscriber count. Over the past few years, Verizon has lost ground in network performance as T-Mobile pushes ahead by many metrics.

    "body": "TL;DR Android 16 introduces “seamless app updates” to make installing app updates faster and less disruptive. This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Gemini shortcut, part of the Google app, on Android now uses a true black background instead of gray. Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR T-Mobile’s app now mentions a “T-Mobile Visa credit card” as an eligible AutoPay payment option. A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

The browser will automatically try HTTPS first and warn users only when visiting new or infrequently visited public HTTP sites. Other browsers already offer similar modes, but Chrome’s scale makes this shift significant and could influence Chromium-based browsers as well. Google is making a major security shift in 2026. Beginning with Chrome 154 in October 2026, the browser will automatically enable the “Always Use Secure Connections” setting for everyone. Once active, Chrome will attempt to load every website over HTTPS first and warn users before visiting a public site that doesn’t support it. The feature has been available since 2022, but only as an optional toggle. Next year, it will become the default for the world’s most widely used browser, solidifying the web’s move into an HTTPS-first era.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority AT&amp;T handles its promotions differently from Verizon or T-Mobile . Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

The Find X9 Pro in particular has a 200MP telephoto camera that can be paired with an external lens for 10x native zoom. The OPPO Find X8 Pro was one of the best Android phones in global markets, owing to its large battery, great dual tele cameras, and extensive list of general features. Now, the company has released the Find X9 series outside China, and these look like an Android user’s dream phones. The two phones share a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 flagship SoC, 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in lieu of last year’s optical scanner. The two phones also ditch the alert slider in favor of a so-called Snap Key. This is a customizable shortcut button that’s mapped to the AI Mind Space feature by default.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.
