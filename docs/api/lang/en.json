They were cut in the final release, along with a bunch of dialogue and scenes, much of which has now been restored by modder HyperspaceTowel. \"This mod brings over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue back from the dead\", says the description of Early Access Scenes Restored . It restores a lot of companion reactivity in particular, enabling extra responses to, er, what you see behind the barn door. It's mostly dialogue for Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale, and Lae'zel, since Karlach and Wyll had different voice actors in early access, though a smaller amount of their dialogue has been restored by splicing existing lines of audio. HyperspaceTowel plans to continue work on this mod, restoring more scenes including the one with the thralls on the nautiloid from the tutorial—another thing I always forget was removed until I start a new game.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding. Chet has been unsettled for a while, but when he finds the missing Woody's eyeglasses in the garbage disposal, …",

I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.

PC Gamer's Morgan Park was there , and disgraced streamer Guy Beahm, better known to the online world as Dr Disrespect, was not—which might seem like an odd thing to say, except, well, he said he was. The whole baffling story began on January 24, when Beahm posted on X about going to Los Angeles to check out Highguard. The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene. (Image credit: Dr Disrespect (Twitter)) This led first to questions about why Wildlight would invite Beahm to the event in the first place. You may recall that he's banned for life from Twitch for, as he put it, messaging a minor in a way \"that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate.\" As it turns out, Beahm was neither invited nor did he attend. After an actual attendee stated that the streamer was not there,…",

Police say Thomas Medlin left his school on that date, boarded a train to the Stony Brook Long Island railroad station, and then went to Grand Central Station, where he was seen on surveillance footage. He hasn't been seen since. Eva Yan, Thomas's mother, told News12 in an interview that detectives believe the boy met someone while playing Roblox online, and subsequently planned to go and meet that person in the city. She added that such behaviour was completely out of character for Thomas. Yan says family and friends are organising search parties across Long Island and the wider city nearly every day. Police add that Thomas’s last known locations were near Cherry and Rutgers streets in Lower Manhattan and later near Sands and Jay Street in Brooklyn, and ask anyone with potential information to contact them (details below). A missing child is a situation with the potential for a tragic ending, and the case remains ongoing, which is why I was stunned to see the Roblox response.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of children's digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—representing an estimated 14 million consumers in the UK. Very briefly, it alleges that Valve prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms, requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices. Valve had argued that the case should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action on a number of technical grounds, including that it will be difficult to accurately determine who is eligible to claim damages. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (via the BBC ) disagreed, however, declaring that \"the certification criteria were satisfied and it was appropriate to grant a CPO on an opt-out basis.\" A website dedicated to the action at steamyouow…",

The Midnight Walkers launches in early access at 6 pm PST on January 28 , as announced in a Steam news post by Oneway Ticket Studio.

A not-insignificant number of people immediately wrote it off, calling it dead on arrival—the next Concord , if you will. Unsurprisingly, this, frankly, unjustified hatred of the very concept of Highguard being a game that exists has gone on to plague its launch. Despite pulling in nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, it's currently sitting at an incredibly low 33% 'mostly negative' reviews. If you've ever played a truly terrible game, a real 33%, then you'd know Highguard is far from that . I can understand why people have been so quick to judge—Highguard is an awkward hodgepodge of genres that was poorly unveiled, and a sharp departure from the developer's penchant for movement shooters.

This is, of course, because up until yesterday New Vegas had absolutely no bespoke sneaking animation for its canine companion Rex.

On a call with PC Gamer ahead of the announcement, Emmert said that there's no hard feelings between him and NetEase over the Jackalyptic closure—\"strategies change, and I totally get it\"—but that he was \"down in the dumps\" until he got the call asking him to come back to Cryptic as CEO. \"I've been on cloud nine ever since, and it was just meant to be, I think,\" Emmert said about his homecoming. Cryptic, which Emmert co-founded 26 years ago and previously led as CEO from 2011 to 2016, has itself only survived the 2020s by the skin of its teeth.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Digitimes also notes that Samsung recently reported very strong financial results, with revenues up by over 22% to roughly $65 billion for the final quarter of 2025.

    "body": "Arc Raiders' Headwinds update is finally live, and it's stacked with tons of updates and new features, including a new solo vs squads matchmaking , but most importantly, a couple of new epic augments. The new Looting MK3 Safekeeper augment is currently the talk of the town with its 18 item slots, Heavy Shield compatibility, and, crucially, its \"safe pocket that allows any item to be stored.\" Yes, you heard right, any item, which means players using this augment can now safely squirrel away any precious weapons they may have on them. (Image credit: Embark Studios) This is a big change from the usual augment, as until now, you couldn't carry any guns in your safe pockets. The only way you could stop other raiders from getting their grubby little hands on your precious Osprey or Venator was by disassembling them as quickly as possible before you got downed. While this new augment may not be entirely useful in the PvP lobbies, where most players actually give each other great guns instead of taking them away. Some players have pointed out how it will be useful when you're fighting your fellow raider or taking on a Matriarch or a Queen: \"you don't wanna lose your jup/equ/aph in the fal…",

It's not just the fact that, as a generally not small woman, my feet don't touch the ground while sitting in this gaming chair, but also the fact I'm perched atop a 5000 mAh lithium ion battery. Yes, this is a $699 / £580 gaming chair offering an array of features that require a considerable amount of juice. But before we get into all of that, let us ask the most basic question: What is it like as a regular ol' gaming chair? Well, as previously mentioned, the first thing to get out of the way is that this is not really made for me; the XL or Plus edition of the DXRacer Martian Series is intended for folks up to 180 cm tall, and is designed to support a weight of up to 125 kg. But even adjusted to my preferred tilt angle and the lowest possible chair height, my feet don't touch the floor, swinging in the air like a tiny tyrant.

According to Steam user Captain_SmellyRat (excellent), the game's resolution is tied to its post processing setting, which means lowering it drops the output resolution in turn—despite reporting otherwise in the settings menu. Youtuber Daniel Owen has also separately confirmed the issue, but I felt it was worth some testing of my own. Jumping into the training area of Highguard, I played around with the post processing options, and the difference was clear to see. Not only does the game look noticeably blurrier with post processing set to Low, but the performance improves dramatically, too. Using a registry edit to force DLSS to display the input and output resolution reveals that, with post processing at its lowest, the game is actually displaying at 1728p on my setup rather than the 2160p it reports in the settings menu, despite the output resolution being set to 100%. Turn post processing to High, and the game runs at full 4K. I tried a few different resolutions to see if the effect scaled down the stack, and yep, post processing Low seems to force the game to run at 80% of its stated resol…",

These are the common Arc material used to craft shield charges, so you'll likely already have a stockpile that you can bring into a raid (that's what I did). Otherwise, you can find them on any Arc machine. So, grab two Arc Powercells and head into Blue Gate to find an Arc Deforester.

With the ongoing second season of the TV show , a replay of Fallout: New Vegas , and the usual pitstops in Fallout 76 , I see VATS every time I close my eyes. But that's probably pretty common for fans right now, especially for those enjoying the second season so much they want nothing more than to experience it for themselves. And while New Vegas obviously has the most accurate in-game locations, Fallout 76 also has some excellent nods to the show with the latest Burning Springs update .

There's the Rust King's domain, the odd, deteriorating traveller hub, and even some giant plastic dinosaurs.

It's called the OpenSplitDeck. The new version looks as chunky, if not chunkier, than the one we saw back in June last year. Though it has been massively overhauled since then with a heap of new upgrades and quality-of-life improvements. It now supports gyro controls, much like the Steam Controller, with one gyroscope in each half of the controller. Gyro functionality is, creator TommyB says, \"a little noisy\" at the moment, but he's looking into ways to improve this and use the dual-gyroscopes to better effect in-game. Each half of the controller also features a slim screen down the inside edge. One of the larger overhauls here is a shift away from Arduino to the Nordic nRF Connect SDK.

That's not just from the likes of publications such as yours truly, but also, it seems, from games, as the Arc B390 is now featured on the official Forza Horizon 6 system requirements . That's a game that's pencilled for a summertime launch (May 19), and as of now, there are only minimum requirements listed. On the GPU front, this means an Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380 or Arc B390. Minimum spec Operating System Windows 10 22H2 (19045) Processor Intel Core i5 8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 Memory 16 GB RAM Graphics Nvidia GTX 1650, AMD RX 6500 XT, Intel Arc A380, or Intel Arc B390 DirectX Version 12 Storage SSD required Note that the B390 is an integrated GPU. The other entries on that list are discrete graphics cards. In other words, if we needed even more confirmation that Panther Lake is capable of bringing the fight to the discrete market, here it is. Intel's new Panther Lake mobile platform has kicked up quite the beneficent storm, offering what seems like a solitary ray of sunshine through the fog of 2026's prices and broader lack of exciting launches.…",

Ultimately, he sees it as less a question of setting immutable challenges for players to overcome, and more anticipating what they want out of the experience and responding to that. \"Do you have any insights into, or thoughts about exposing extremely granular difficulty options to players?\" asked viewer agroggybog. They went on to explain that they were an avid modder, digging into the guts of games like Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire to tweak the progression curves of player stats⁠—which is about as granular a difficulty modifier as you can get. They further asked for Sawyer's thoughts on the cost/benefit analysis of letting players get so far into the weeds \"officially,\" or at least baking in the modding freedom to do so. \"If it cost nothing⁠—which it does not⁠—then I would say let players in-game set their difficulty options however they like,\" said Sawyer. \"And when it comes to exposing data tables and letting players mod that stuff, let 'em do whatever the heck they want.\" The nature of this question has changed over the course of h…",

Hey, Highguard is out. I played around six hours between launch day and a preview event in Los Angeles last week. It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a business model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it. I will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming up with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\" which is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens. Highgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three. Teams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This phase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but usually not immediately fighting…",

Progression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the fancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off yourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's more like a small skeletal squad. You can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians. They aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire only seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.
