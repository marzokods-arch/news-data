How it’s taken fourteen years for Spotify Lossless to finally arrive on the scene is anyone’s guess, but now that it’s here, my interest in the world’s biggest music platform is piqued once again. In many ways, I’m the perfect candidate for Spotify Lossless. I have a reasonable ear for quality, am savvy enough to know by bit depths from my sample rates, and own some half-decent audio kit too. Perhaps Spotify’s new setting is perfect for you too, but you should check that you meet these three criteria (in addition to living in one of the 50 supported markets) before you stump up for that Premium subscription.",

In effect, it may as well be missing. I was once a fervent smartwatch truther and felt naked going anywhere without that little screen on my arm. But a few weeks ago, my Galaxy Watch 4’s battery dropped to 0%, and so did my patience. Primarily due to my laziness and partially as an experiment, I decided to go one week without wearing the smartwatch. To my surprise, it has been close to a month now, and I’m struggling to find a reason to switch it on again.",

All of this sounds great, and I can’t wait to test it out, but I can’t help but feel like Google is still missing out on more important and overdue updates to the Home app. Talking to Gemini is cool , but it doesn’t check all the boxes of what I expect from my smart home app. Instead, I wish Google would work on these six features.",

Then, Google transitioned its default identification assistant to Circle to Search, emphasizing what was on your screen more, and it threw me for a loop.

As a purely scientific tool, it’s a great way to sweep through troves of documents, research reports, news, and distill trends. While that makes it particularly useful for research, there’s one more sector that makes heavy use of it. The finance sector, particularly high-frequency trading, has been using AI and machine learning for a while now. Custom AI solutions are also used for predictive analytics and portfolio automation. However, those tools depend on highly specialized in-house AI tools. What I’ve been wondering is — can a general-purpose AI like Google Gemini be optimised to perform similar functions? I was curious to know if an AI model could make sense of my investments, identify risks, and maybe even suggest strategies that were worth testing. A few months ago, I decided to run a small experiment. Instead of blindly following every piece of advice from my portfolio advisor, I wanted to see what would happen if I brought Google’s Gemini AI into the mix. My idea was pretty straightforward. Take the same account statements I usually share with my advisor, feed them into Gemini, and ask it to give me…",

Scott Brown / Android Authority In the tech community, Google’s Pixel and Samsung’s Galaxy phones generate a lot of buzz, creating the illusion that they are neck-and-neck competitors in the sales race. However, the reality couldn’t be more different. Samsung is the undisputed king of the global smartphone market, while Google doesn’t even crack the top five. For context, in the second quarter of 2025, Samsung shipped 58 million phones globally, 13.3 million of which were sold in the US . During that same period, Google shipped around 800,000 units in the US, while its global sales are not completely known. The sales gap in the US is massive, and it’s likely even bigger when taking international markets into account.",

These options now range from bare-bones budget plans to services nearly identical to postpaid, yet the sheer number of prepaid brands can be overwhelming. Some advertise heavily, but many remain obscure. Are these lesser-known carriers worth your attention, or is the risk too high? It really depends on what you want and how much risk you’re willing to take. First, it’s important to understand that there’s no clear line on what qualifies as a lesser-known carrier, as it comes down more to your individual knowledge about the industry. Thanks to increased advertising, you’ve likely at least heard of Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Metro by T-Mobile, and maybe even a few other options like Tello or Total. Still, if a carrier is an absolute unknown to you, it pays to do your homework.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is working to improve the performance of graphical Linux apps on Android, which currently run slowly using inefficient CPU-based rendering. This will be achieved by implementing gfxstream, a technology that forwards graphics API calls to the host’s GPU for near-native performance. Evidence for this was found in a hidden “Graphics Acceleration” setting in the Terminal app that enables a new “GPU-accelerated renderer.” Earlier this year, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app , giving developers and power users the ability to run full-fledged Linux applications on their Android devices. While it was initially limited to command-line apps, Google recently added support for running Linux apps with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), a significant step forward for the feature. However, there’s a major catch with the current implementation. All graphics rendering is handled by the CPU instead of the GPU, which is not only incredibly slow but also very taxing on a device’s battery and thermals. This is only a temporary problem, though, as Google is already working on a new feature that will make these apps run significantly better.",

    "body": "TL;DR For the past couple of weeks, YouTube TV users have been complaining about bad picture quality when using multiview. Numerous reports indicate that watching a single channel appears fine, but the quality severely degrades when watching two, three, or four channels at once. This is reportedly happening even with fast, wired internet connections and with other streaming apps running fine, suggesting it may be an issue with YouTube TV itself. YouTube TV’s multiview feature is one of my favorite things about the streaming service, especially right now during football season when I can have four games playing simultaneously on any given Sunday. Unfortunately, multiview hasn’t been working very well for a lot of YouTube TV subscribers. For the last couple of weeks, the r/YouTubeTV subreddit has been flooded with user complaints about multiview being hampered by extremely low picture quality, including comments about multiview streams appearing blocky and “sometimes unviewable.”",

According to our recent poll, nearly 63% of you love it too , while most of the remaining 37% find it acceptable. For the small fraction of our readers who dislike the new design, the primary complaint is readability. Material 3 Expressive makes copious use of background blur effects, which, while visually appealing, comes at the cost of text visibility. Although this may not affect most people, the reduced contrast poses an accessibility challenge for some users. To address this, Google plans to roll out a new Android setting that reduces these background blur effects.

Both of these toggles would automatically decide when your phone switches from mobile data to Wi-Fi. It seems like one toggle could let your phone automatically switch to mobile data based on places where you’ve manually made the switch. Many Android phones today offer an option to seamlessly switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi as needed. This is particularly useful if you’ve got a poor Wi-Fi connection, allowing you to automatically switch to mobile data for a better experience. However, it looks like Samsung could offer two ways to customize this switch-over experience. SammyGuru reports that One UI 8.5 has two AI-related toggles that govern when you switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data. The first toggle is called Intelligent Link Assessment , and switches your phone from Wi-Fi to mobile data based on “Wi-Fi link data.” I’m guessing this means the phone will look at your Wi-Fi connection’s speed, latency, and other factors before deciding to switch. That’s pretty similar to the option seen on phones from other companies.",

Google announced the September Pixel Drop earlier this month, bringing new features to various Pixel devices. It’s taken a while, but the company is finally bringing its promised features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 . Google announced on its Google Pixel Buds Help forum that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is getting a new update right now (version 4.467). This update includes Adaptive Audio and Loud Noise Protection. The former feature dynamically adjusts your earbud volume based on your surroundings, while the latter automatically reduces the volume of loud noises around you (e.g., a siren blaring).",

Called the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, the chipset marks a new split within Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 family. The company says the split mirrors Apple’s two-chip iPhone strategy. Update: September 26, 2025 (1:15 AM ET): Qualcomm has now confirmed some details about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. The company revealed to journalists, including Android Authority , that the chip has a 3nm TSMC design with custom Oryon CPU cores (3.8GHz Prime core and 3.32GHz Performance cores). The language suggests we’re looking at a 1+7 CPU layout as opposed to the 8 Elite family’s 2+6 setup. Otherwise, the company said this chip has a “next-gen” Adreno GPU, a “powerful” NPU, and a “superior AI-ISP powered camera.” That doesn’t tell us much, so we’re still keen to see exactly what this chipset is capable of compared to its Elite stablemates.",

You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation. According to CNBC’s Alex Sherman, YouTube’s deal to carry NBCUniversal is expiring at the end of the month, and as of right now a smooth renewal doesn’t sound particularly guaranteed.",

A jailbreak specialist says the e-books are now tied to a hidden “account secret” only accessible with a previously jailbroken device. It follows earlier restrictions like removing USB transfers and blocking downloads on older versions of the Kindle Android app. Amazon just rolled out a change to its Kindle e-readers that could frustrate anyone who likes to keep permanent copies of their e-books . The newest firmware update, version 5.18.5, strengthens Amazon’s Digital Rights Management (DRM) — the copy-protection system that prevents people from freely backing up or transferring Kindle books. Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method. In the poster’s explanation, they said the new system applies fresh encryption to any newly downloaded e-books, regardless of when they were originally purchased or published. Books where the publisher has opted out of copy-protection are not affected.",

So far, all you’ve needed to activate it was your phone number — so anyone who knew it could potentially lock your phone. That’s now slightly more secure with the addition of an optional security question. Google offers plenty of automatic ways to try and limit your exposure when someone takes off with your smartphone. Features like Theft Detection use sensors to know when a thief grabs your phone and makes a break for it, while Offline Device Lock prevents a thief from using a lack of connectivity to give them more time with an unlocked handset. Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools. And if you’re using 2FA like you should, signing into a new device without your phone could be a little tricky.

With Amazon’s next Prime sale just weeks away, the company could have done without the headlines its subscription service is making today. Amazon just agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle claims it made Prime signups too easy and cancellations too hard. As reported by The New York Times , the settlement came just days into a Seattle jury trial stemming from a 2023 Federal Trade Commission lawsuit . Regulators accused Amazon of steering people into Prime memberships during checkout by highlighting free shipping perks while playing down the cost, and then making it difficult to leave with a cancellation process that involved multiple screens and pressure offers.",

American Express recently overhauled its high-end Platinum credit card, and in the process, it increased the already hefty annual fee from $695 up to an eye-watering $895. American Express justified the higher price with new perks, such as a $400 Resy credit and a $200 Oura Ring credit, but there’s another new feature that topples all of them. If and only if you have the new $895/year Amex Platinum card — like yours truly does — you’ll now unlock something completely unheard of: a dark mode for Amex’s mobile app.",

There are three areas of focus: reducing AI slop, stopping impersonation, and disclosing whether AI was used to make a track. The music spam filter will be released this fall. AI music creators, like Suno AI , are on the rise. And with that surge in popularity, streaming services, like Spotify, are getting bogged down by increasing levels of AI-generated content. Whether the music is passible or just pure spam, the presence of this content is having an effect on the experience. Now Spotify is starting to take steps to address the problem. Today, Spotify announced it is rolling out new policies and tools to fight off spammy AI content. This initiative is focusing on three areas of concern: AI slop, impersonation, and disclosure of AI use. According to the company, the goal is to provide “listeners with greater transparency about the music they hear” and to protect artists from spam, impersonation, and deception.",

Apple maintains its anodization process exceeds industry standards. Apple’s latest phones hit store shelves last week, and the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max are all available for purchase right now. The iPhone 17 series features some striking new designs, but early testing has revealed an issue: several of the new models seem especially prone to scratching in certain areas. Apple’s now acknowledged the problem, but its response probably won’t do much to soothe affected buyers. About five minutes into JerryRigEverything ‘s iPhone 17 Pro durability test video, the channel’s Zack Nelson clearly demonstrates the issue. While the 17 Pro’s anodized aluminum finish is mostly able to resist scratching when rubbed with a coin, the finish gives way around the sharp edges of the phone’s new camera plateau. Zack says this is down to a confluence of thin anodization applied over a sharp corner, making for an especially vulnerable finish in that area.",

Imagine that you’re in the market for a new vehicle. Your goal is to take your family on long road trips, exploring national parks and camping under the stars. You need space for people, beds, and maybe even a small kitchenette. A tricked-out Sprinter camper van seems like the perfect solution, which would cost you about $150,000. Unfortunately, your friend, a die-hard car enthusiast, scoffs at your choice. “A Sprinter van? Why would you buy that slow thing?” they ask. “For the same amount of money, you could get a Porsche 911! It can go from zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds, bro!”",
