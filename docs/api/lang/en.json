Pablo Alborán,&nbsp; KM0&nbsp; (Warner Music Spain) Pablo Alborán&#8217;s personal and heartfelt seventh album,&nbsp; KM0 , is a set of 14 songs and four bonus tracks in which he explores a variety of rhythms and styles. Born from the pain and uncertainty of a loved one’s illness, as the artist recounted in a recent interview with&nbsp; Billboard , the album showcases a more mature and determined musician with renewed artistic freedom. Here, Alborán takes on the songwriting of all the songs and, for the first time, produces and arranges most of them, experimenting with rhythms like country/folk (“Vámonos de Aquí,” with Indiara Sfair), salsa music (“La Vida Que Nos Espera”) and merengue (“Si Te Quedas”). The album opens with “Clickbait,” a pop track that critiques the superficiality and fake news of social media, addressing the obsession with fame and &#8220;likes.&#8221; And continues with the emotional title track, “KM0,” in which he sings about facing a new start after going through a very difficult p…",

    "body": "Pierce the Veil leads Billboard ’s Alternative Airplay chart for a second time, lifting a spot to No. 1 on the Nov. 15-dated survey with “So Far So Fake.” The veteran rockers from San Diego previously led with “Emergency Contact” for a week in August 2023. “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake” are both on the same album, 2023’s The Jaws of Life . So why the two-plus-year gap between Alternative Airplay reigns? While not initially a promoted single, “So Far So Fake” was serviced to radio this summer after it went viral on shortform video platforms such as TikTok, spurred by a dance challenge set mostly to its instrumental break. Boosted by that buzz, “So Far So Fake” debuted on the multimetric Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart in August, eventually rising to No. 8 later that month. It also became the band’s first Billboard Hot 100 entry, reaching No. 64. In between “Emergency Contact” and “So Far So Fake,” Pierce the Veil made Alternative Airplay once via its No. 27-peaking cover of Radiohead ’s “Karma Police” in June 2024. The band’s only other charter, “Circles,” hit No. 31 in 2016. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock &amp; Alternative Airplay chart, “So Far So Fa…",

    "body": "The easy thing for Rosalía would have been to follow up 2022’s successful Motomami , which placed her on the brink of superstardom, with a quick album that walked that same path: Songs that treaded the line between her flamenco Spanish roots and Latin and reggaetón influences. It was a formula that yielded hits like “Despechá,” Rosalía’s take on merengue, and “La Fama,” her take on bachata alongside The Weeknd. The set provided an unlikely segue from her stunning but niche-appealing El Mal Querer , to a broad audience who embraced Rosalía and her sound with cult-like passion. It stands to reason, then, that something along those lines would follow in quick succession. Instead, fans waited for two and a half years for LUX , an album that not only breaks parameters for Rosalía, but for the musical landscape as a whole. Recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, it’s an ambitious, complex, sprawling orchestral and operatic ouvre of 18 tracks, performed in 13 different languages, where Rosalía pushes her vocal prowess into untested waters. This isn’t your tried-and-done collection of pop songs set to symphonic arrangements, but rather a new take on pop (or is it classical?) that tes…",

His early recordings from that period — many featured on the just-released The Bootleg Series Volume 18: Through the Open Window, 1956-1963 — reveal a young artist still finding his voice, often mimicking the melodies and vocal styles of his heroes. Within a few months, Dylan would go through a transformation. The young singer-songwriter became an interpreter of others’ works, imbuing them with a unique character missing on earlier recordings. “The story of Volume 18 is Bob Dylan becoming Bob Dylan,” Sean Wilentz tells Billboard ’s Behind the Setlist podcast. Wilentz, author of the 2010 book Dylan in America , wrote Volume 18 &#8216;s detailed, often fascinating 125-page liner notes that provides historical context for the expansive eight-CD set. “It&#8217;s about his coming of age, his maturation — first as a performer and then as a songwriter — to become the person that we think of [today].” With Dylan surrounded by folk, blues, jazz and comedians such as Lenny Bruce, his artistic growth began immediately upon arriving…",
