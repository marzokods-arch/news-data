    "body": "TL;DR The BBC reports that one iPhone user tracking their stolen phone last Christmas got the ball rolling on a bust that took down a massive smuggling ring. Suspects were arrested with over 2,000 stolen phones in their possession. The group is believed to be responsible for shipping over 40,000 phones a year out of the UK. How far would you go to get a stolen phone back? When someone makes off with your beloved handset, tools like Google’s Find Hub and Apple Find My can empower us to track our hardware, but what do you do next ? Lock down your data, sure (if not full-on erase everything), but what then? Just give all your info to the police and hope for the best? You might not have a lot of faith that reports like that can actually go anywhere, but today we’re hearing about a major police action in the UK that broke up a phone-smuggling ring, and it all got started by tracking one stolen phone. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The new feature lets you see exactly which words were changed after you’ve finished typing a sentence. Tapping on a highlighted word reveals the original text as a suggestion, allowing you to quickly revert the correction with a single tap. It’s significantly easier to make mistakes while typing on a smartphone than on a PC, which is why keyboard apps like Gboard have aggressive auto-correction tools turned on by default. While auto-correction is generally helpful, it can sometimes choose the wrong word, an error you might not notice without proofreading. To make it easier to spot these unwanted auto-corrections, Gboard will now highlight text it has changed, letting you tap to undo them later. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The sharing and download options for generated images could also be redesigned in the future. Gemini, Google’s AI digital assistant, can be accessed on Android flagships through its app or through the overlay (which in turn can be triggered through a hotword or a button shortcut). The app is the primary way to access all of Gemini’s powerful features, but the overlay is inarguably easier to access since you can trigger it even when you are on third-party apps.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The Supreme Court has denied Google’s request for a stay on some provisions of the Epic Games lawsuit. This means Google must now implement several changes to the Google Play Store within 14 days. The changes include allowing developers to link to alternative download methods, use external payment systems, and set their own prices. In July 2025, Google lost an appeal against the original Epic vs Google lawsuit , which meant the company had just 14 days to make sweeping changes to the Google Play Store. Google appealed to the Supreme Court after this decision and also separately filed for a stay until its appeal is decided. Unfortunately for Google, the Supreme Court has declined the company’s request to temporarily stay parts of those sweeping changes from taking effect. The net result? Google now has 14 days once again to change several Google Play Store policies. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

We’ve uncovered evidence of Nano Banana preparations in Google Lens and Circle to Search. The Lens integration appears slightly further along, and mirrors what we’ve already seen from Search AI Mode. Nano Banana might be the best thing to happen to Google’s AI offerings in a while, and over the last few weeks we’ve had a lot of fun checking out what the system can do — even if it does seem to struggle a little with varying aspect ratios . We’ve already seen hints that Google has big plans for the tool, like integrating Nano Banana with Search AI Mode , and today we’re looking into a few more places where Nano Banana appears to be getting ready to make an appearance.

Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home.

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority Chrome is a great browser, but it’s far from the best one out there. I tested more or less every major alternative to Google’s popular browser and found a better option for my personal wants and needs. Samsung Internet has more features, offers superior customizability, and comes with a few extra security options. Despite what many think, it can be downloaded to just about any Android phone , so it’s not exclusive to Samsung devices. Most people just default to Chrome, as it’s the most well-known and readily available browser on all smartphones. But I urge everyone to at least try out Samsung Internet to see that Chrome has fierce competition.",

Previously leaked code suggests that the feature will enable an AI assistant to answer and transcribe calls automatically. New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. One UI 8.5 is destined to be the next big update for Galaxy phones and tablets, and it will be a bigger deal than One UI 8. Leaks suggest that Samsung will reserve most of its newer features and bigger changes for this x.5 release. We have also found out that One UI 8.5 will be based on Android 16 QPR2 , which will also bring all the new QPR features to Samsung’s devices. We’ve also spotted that automatic call screening is coming to Galaxy phones , and it seems Samsung still has more improvements in the pipeline for this feature.

    "body": "TL;DR A post on Reddit shows the Sony Xperia 10 VII doesn’t include a USB cable in the box. Smartphones typically don’t come with chargers anymore, but cables are still standard. We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions. Sony’s not really a major player in the smartphone space these days, but this seems like the type of trend we should expect to see gain traction over the next c…",

Readers feel that Google Pixels, which are priced as flagships, largely lack the performance to justify the price tag.

The recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 looks promising on paper, and Qualcomm seems poised for another successful year, securing its place among top Android flagships once again. Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance. Still, it appears LTE’s days are numbered, at least for those on the T-Mobile network. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Over the last few years, this has changed a bit as T-Mobile has become a major leader in 5G and beyond. The truth is that all three major carriers now offer fairly similar features and performance overall, though it ultimately depends on where you live.

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority About 15 years ago, when I first switched from a Nokia to an Android phone, it wasn’t a mere choice; it was also a financial decision. I couldn’t afford to buy an iPhone, and its price, padded with hefty import fees, made it a dream I refused to approach. Over the years, I became more fascinated with Android’s customization. A decade and a half later, I consciously stick to Android phones. While my attempts at heavily modding my phones or fiddling with custom ROMs have decreased significantly, there are two things I still actively do: change wallpapers routinely and switch to a new launcher every few weeks or months, actively hopping between multiple awesome launchers on Android .",

We cannot confidently say whether One UI 8.5 will arrive on the Galaxy S22 or not. The One UI 8 update train is pushing ahead at full steam, and there’s no stopping it. In a matter of a few weeks, Samsung has rolled out the update to the last three generations of flagship bar phones and foldable devices, along with some tablets and affordable A-series phones. Now, it’s trickling down deeper and reaching the Galaxy S22 series , which started to receive its first One UI 8 update. The stable One UI 8 update has arrived for the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra, as highlighted by noted Samsung tipster Tarun Varun on an X post . It weighs in at about 3.2GB and upgrades the Android version to 16. The update is available to a user in Turkey, so a global rollout can be expected to follow soon.",

In the case of one unlucky Galaxy Ring user , battery swelling turned a well-fitting device into a finger trap, grounding his flight plans and sending him to the ER. The fear of having a ring of any kind stuck on my finger is very real. That’s exactly what happened to tech creator Daniel (@ZONEofTECH). According to Daniel, after his Galaxy Ring’s battery failed, soap and hand…",

Until very recently, the crown jewel of this package was Veo 3, Google’s impressive text-to-video generator that could turn any description into a hyper-realistic short video. But the AI world moves at lightning speed. This past week, OpenAI announced its competing Sora 2 model, meaning Google’s video generator is no longer the only game in town. While Sora 2 is invite-only for now, the model already has an active user base. So naturally, I took OpenAI’s Sora 2 for a spin vs Google’s Veo 3 to find out which AI video generator has the upper hand.",

LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
