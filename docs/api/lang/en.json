    "body": "It’s impossible to deny Taylor Swift ’s impact on music. With hundreds of songs and dozens of hits, she&#8217;s a master singer-songwriter with countless awards – including the only artist to win the album of the year at the Grammys four times. But a music career isn’t only about music — it’s about the visual execution too. And though the age-old saying “don’t judge a book by its cover” is generally true, an album cover can play a big role in making it memorable. For Swift, a handful of her biggest albums feature some of the most memorable art. When 1989 was released in 2014, for example, everyone from Swifties to casual listeners attempted their re-creations of the iconic half-face Polaroid cover. And that album went on to win album of the year at the Grammys. At the same time, not all hit covers are hit albums, and vice versa. So Billboard decided to rank each of the pop star’s covers since her debut in 2006. Now, let&#8217;s be clear: This list is only taking album artwork into account – not the merit of the music itself. We’re simply looking at covers: filters, styling, framing and how the creative represents the album as a whole. And, yes, this list is completely subjective, …",

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team has also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",
