Telecom providers can exploit a hidden Android feature to show you an “inflated” signal strength. AT&amp;T and Verizon have already been spotted using this tactic. Telecom carriers often battle over broader coverage, the number of zip codes covered by 5G , and faster speeds. These claims, based on the carriers’ own marketing teams, paint a picture that’s far from the actual scenario and are often even contradicted in actual reports by independent parties . However, while it’s natural for corporations to paint a brighter picture, Google has been found colluding with carriers, allowing them to display fake signal strength on your phone. Beyond tall marketing claims and fake 5G icons , carriers may also be lying through their teeth to you about signal strength. A recent report by Nick vs Networking highlights a flag, KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL , in the source code for Android’s Carrier Config Manager, related to artificially “inflating” the network strength.",

The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

HUAWEI’s Mate lineup has long favored bold styling and camera-first hardware, but its “Air” variants have traditionally leaned towards slimmer and more minimalist designs. However, that expectation may be changing. Leaks of the HUAWEI Mate 70 Air have surfaced online on Weibo , giving us our clearest look yet at the ultra-thin device.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Recently, some T-Mobile Android users have received a message stating “com.applovin.array.apphub.tmobile uninstalled successfully.” The notice refers to the removal of AppHub, a preinstalled app from AppLovin that functioned as an app recommendation platform. AppHub was discontinued after reports showed it could silently install apps, so the uninstall message reflects its permanent removal and is not a system error or bug. As first spotted on Reddit by user OkAsk3950 , it seems many Android-owning T-Mobile customers have recently received the same message: “com.applovin.array.apphub.tmobile uninstalled successfully”. So what is this app exactly, and why is it suddenly being removed without warning? It turns out that this has to do with a pre-installed app called AppHub.

Movies, TV shows, and 21 channels disappeared from YouTube TV as a result, but Disney content is also vanishing from more Google platforms. Users can no longer buy or rent Disney content from YouTube, Google Play, or Google TV as the negotiations continue. Google and Disney are amid a tense content rights battle that saw 21 channels disappear from YouTube TV last week. Disney is using its strong content portfolio, which includes ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic, as leverage in the negotiations. Now, it appears Disney is pulling its owned media from all of Google’s digital storefronts, not just YouTube TV’s live television service. Movies and TV shows owned by Disney or its subsidiaries are no longer available for purchase or to rent on Google Play, YouTube, or Google TV , as spotted by 9to5Google . Users will only be able to watch Disney-owned content on those platforms if they previously purchased them or have an active Disney Plus subscription.",

Google’s Gemma large-language model was introduced as a next-gen AI companion inside its AI Studio platform, designed to support developers with text generation, creative drafts, summaries, and more. It represented Google’s broader push toward open experimentation with its advanced models, until everything hit a snag. Google has now quietly pulled Gemma from the public developer interface. First reported by TechCrunch , the move follows a formal letter to CEO Sundar Pichai from Senator Marsha Blackburn , a Republican from Tennessee, who said Gemma produced a fabricated allegation when prompted with: “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?”",

New alarms, ringtones, and notification sounds highlight the wildlife of Japan. How much effort to you put in to customizing your Android experience — really making your phone yours ? One of the great things about this platform is that users get so much latitude in terms of their approach to customization, with a full custom ROM or maybe just an alternate launcher at one extreme, and making your own wallpaper over on the other. No matter where along that spectrum you fall, Android has options for you, and today we’re learning about some new ones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Nintendo DS was a groundbreaking console when it launched more than two decades ago, but there are vanishingly few ways to play DS games on modern hardware.

The screens themselves have a resolution of 640×480, which is higher than the original consoles, but doesn’t offer perfect integer scaling. In other words, some games with pixel graphics may look a little off to the discerning eye.",

So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

This leak corroborates previous design leaks that suggested that the Galaxy S254 Ultra is ditching its boxy design. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series is in a bit of a pre-release upheaval. After all the drama around the Galaxy S26 Edge , we’re back to the usual three Galaxy S series flagships, but now on a delayed timeline as the company scrambles to get the Galaxy S26 Plus going on time. Leaks suggest that Samsung will hold its Unpacked event in San Francisco on February 25, 2026 . While we wait for the company to make any related announcement, we’re now back to the usual phone leaks, this time giving us a fair idea of the shape of the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s display.

The leaked information aligns with earlier reports of a delayed launch for the series. A new report from Korean outlet Money Today (via Jukan on X ) claims that Samsung will launch the Galaxy S26 series at an Unpacked event in San Francisco on February 25, 2026. The company has yet to officially confirm the date, but industry sources cited by the publication indicate that Samsung has begun preparations for the launch. If the leaked Galaxy S26 launch date is accurate, this would mark Samsung’s first San Francisco-based Galaxy S event since the launch of the Galaxy S23 series in 2023.",

    "body": "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Google restricting background work. With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

One of the biggest flaws with the concept of smart homes is planned obsolescence. That’s exactly what happened to the first- and second-generation Nest Learning Thermostat last week. But don’t throw your thermostat away just yet. It can still be used, and it may not stay dumb for long. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google’s keenly aware of that: It offers a version of the YouTube app that’s explicitly made for children’s content in YouTube Kids, and earlier this year, rolled out a controversial AI-based age estimation system to automatically flag accounts that may be used by minors. These measures are meant in part to help Google avoid legal trouble — like a 2019 class-action suit filed in California accusing Google and YouTube of violating privacy laws by collecting information about minors for the purposes of advertising. The suit was eventually settled for a sum of $30 million, and now, according to Top Class Actions , affected users are able to submit claims to get a cut of that settlement.",

It’s now available to buy in the US for $36.99. The device went on preorder earlier in the week and is now listed on Amazon, where a 5% coupon brings the price down to roughly $35. The 8-in-1 extender includes two app-controlled smart outlets on the front, while the four always-on outlets sit along the sides — giving you three plug-in surfaces in total. There’s also a USB-C and a USB-A port.

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",
