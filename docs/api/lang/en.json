Despite being Amazon’s most advanced Kindle and first large-screen color E-Ink model, the device currently lacks a true Dark Mode across the interface. There is an option to darken book pages using the Page Color setting, but that only applies within supported ebooks. The rest of the experience, including the home screen, library, and workspace, is not supported.",

The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, positioning it below the recently launched OnePlus 15R. We’re unsure if the said phone is the Nord 6, the OnePlus Turbo, or any other. With the earlier-than-usual unveiling of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, followed by the less powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, we’ve already seen Android flagships lining up for global launch. Although Samsung is expected to delay its announcement of the Galaxy S26 series , OnePlus’ flagship, the OnePlus 15 , is already up for sale in global markets. The brand also recently followed up with the launch of the OnePlus 15R , much sooner than the typical launch cycle. Now, with the spare time on its hands, OnePlus is working on less premium options, and one of them is already emerging in leaks and may launch soon. Per fresh leaks, OnePlus is gearing up to launch yet another phone set for global markets. Leaker Abhishek Yadav recently posted on X that a OnePlus phone codenamed “Volkswagen” is under development.",

Existing pre-orders are unaffected, with shipping still planned for early January and March. The move follows similar RAM-related issues affecting rivals like AYN, indicating an industry-wide problem for Android gaming handhelds. Early-bird pricing doesn’t usually disappear mid-preorder, but that’s what’s just happened with the Retroid Pocket 6. In a not-unfamiliar state of affairs for the industry, the company confirmed that it ended the RP6’s discounted pre-order pricing earlier than planned, citing a sharp increase in RAM costs. In a post on X , Retroid said it had intended to keep the Early Bird price through January. However, it has already burned through its initial memory supply, and replenishing stock now means paying “significantly higher prices.” With that, the company somewhat apologetically states it can’t sustain the discount.",

The upcoming phone is also tipped to have a 200MP main camera and a 200MP “mid-telephoto” lens. This means it could be the most impressive camera phone of 2026. We haven’t seen a proper 10x telephoto camera on a smartphone since 2023’s Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra . However, a new leak suggests that a major rival to Samsung’s Ultra phone could revive this feature, and then some. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The female rapper’s recent alignment with the Make America Great Again movement has caught some interest because of her past criticism of Trump even when the artist’s own political ideology had been difficult to pin down. But her appearance Sunday at the flagship event for the powerful conservative youth organization may shore up her status as a MAGA acolyte. Minaj mocked California Gov.

    "body": "Credit: Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority There are plenty of mixed opinions on AI’s potential benefits and harms , but I’ll admit I’ve been somewhat hooked on it from day one. I tend to dive deep into subjects with AI for short bursts that might last hours or on-and-off for a few days, and then drift away for weeks or more when life gets busy with things that are obviously more important. Slowly but surely, though, I realized I was doing less and less when it came to other personal interests. While my AI use never disrupted my real-life obligations or relationships, it was starting to cannibalize my hobbies. Recently, I started scrolling through my massive ChatGPT log entries. Some were simple entertainment, and others were deep thoughts that frankly got a bit heavy. There were more interactions than I’d ever care to count. That’s when the thought hit me: “Has this become my new doom scroll?” I started wondering how I got to that point, how much time I was wasting, and why it felt so addictive. Eventually, I took a deeper look at my AI usage patterns and then took a step back.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority OnePlus typically launches its flagship with an R-branded companion. The latter is characterized by slightly less impactful specifications, including a relatively dull display, a less appealing camera, or a generation-old processor. This year, however, the OnePlus 15R has earned a separate launch, independent of the OnePlus 15 ‘s shadow. That’s because the gap between the two phones is closing, as they share several features on their spec sheets, and these similarities help elevate the OnePlus 15R closer to the status of a flagship Android phone — even though it’s still a flagship-killer at heart . My colleague Joe Maring reviewed the OnePlus 15R and wasn’t quite convinced it is the appropriate update to the 13R, especially given the downgraded cameras, OxygenOS 16’s shift towards an iOS-like aesthetic, and a $100 price bump. While I don’t disagree, I view the OnePlus 15R as packing all the essential bits from the flagship 15, especially for those craving performance and longevity. And if you’re not looking for the swankiest of features, the OnePlus 15R may be worth your consideration.",

In their place was a new, expandable Internet tile that housed the old mobile data and Wi-Fi toggles. The change aimed to simplify things for users, but it had the side effect of making it more tedious to toggle Wi-Fi and mobile data. Years after rolling out this change, though, Google may be on the verge of reversing it in a future update to Android 16 .

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority Android 16’s first major update made me fall back in love with Quick Settings. After Android 12 took away the smaller toggles and switched to the large pill-shaped buttons in the name of Material You, I started using Quick Settings less and less. See, any time a button is hidden away from my eyes and requires more than one or two swipes or taps, I just forget it exists. And this is what happened for me with Quick Settings on Android 12 to 15; I set up the ones I used the most up front and forgot about the rest. Android 16 QPR1 brought the ability to collapse each large pill into half its size and thus fit more toggles on one screen, and that’s what I immediately did. I now had more space to try new things with Quick Settings, like launch apps or start actions inside apps, but I blanked out for a while, not finding the right way to use the extra space. That is, until I realized that the action I needed the most is to control my smart home in general, and my standing desk in particular.",

Don’t get me wrong, Samsung phones are made in both of these countries, but the devil is in the details.

Samsung’s next in-house flagship mobile processor, the Exynos 2600 , was just officially announced as the world’s first smartphone chip built using the 2nm Gate-All-Around (GAA) manufacturing process. It’s rumored to be powering select Samsung Galaxy S26 models in some global markets, but there may be another upcoming Samsung flagship using the chip. The Samsung Exynos 2600 might also power the Galaxy Z Flip 8, according to a new report. As reported by The Bell , Samsung could use the Exynos 2600 chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 8, which is set to arrive next summer (via 9to5Google ). The report cites unnamed industry sources, and says that Samsung is considering the Exynos 2600 for its next flip phone — nothing has been decided yet.",

The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen.

Compared to existing foldables, it may be wider than Google’s Pixel Fold, but not as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to announce the device by late 2026, though shipments might not stabilize until mid-to-late 2027 due to production ramp-up issues. The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year. While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Lock Glimpse debuted in Nothing OS 4.0 as an optional lock screen feature, but it is now raising concerns over battery drain. It’s a system-level component, meaning it can’t be uninstalled without root access and can only be toggled off. Even when disabled, the system reportedly attempts to restart Lock Glimpse every few seconds, resulting in unnecessary background activity. Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience. You wake your phone and see rotating images paired with short headlines, each linking out to a web article. The pitch is that it adds variety and context. The reality, according to many users , is that it feels a lot like ads wearing a minimalist disguise.",
