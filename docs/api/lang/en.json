The writer and director of 2022's Barbarian and this year's Weapons now has two solid horror hits under his belt, and is in pre-production on his next one: a Resident Evil movie planned for 2026. That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie‚Äîthe film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic. And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy. \"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story.

Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site Games Fray (which broke last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods.

Split Fiction was one of a dozen recipients alongside not-videogames like the TP-7 field recorder by Teenage Engineering and a furniture collection called The King's Hat.

Plus, this is the zombie apocalypse. Of course you should be able to craft a weapon that fires spinning sawblades. (Image credit: Techland) Thing is, the blueprint for the Sawblade Launcher isn't easy to find in Dying Light: The Beast unless you know exactly where to look. It's hidden way, way off in a section of the map you might not explore until late in the game. I was level 9 before I found it (and I finished the game at level 13), so I spent most of the game without it. But the Sawblade Launcher blueprint is in a level 6 area of the map, so you should be able to get your hands on it much earlier than I did.

If that sounds like the beginning of a eulogy‚Ä¶yeah. It isn't technically dead, and there's a universe where BioWare makes some incredible comeback with Mass Effect 4, but I don't think it's this one. After Andromeda, Anthem, and Veilguard, it seems that no matter the talent still left in the studio, EA just isn't going to give BioWare the time or trust to make the kind of RPGs it originally spearheaded anymore. I'm finally ready to let go. If you too are mourning the studio's effective downfall, rest assured that the BioWare-style RPG lives on elsewhere. My colleague Fraser Brown insisted back in 2023 that the BioWare-style RPG was dead and just didn't know it yet.

You're still getting that sweet, sweet 3D V-Cache technology and the gaming performance boosts that come with it, but at a lower price point than usual, which allows you to throw a little more cash at the points that really matter to you. Being a six-core CPU with 96 MB of L3 cache, it's sort of like a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (the CPU in my home rig) but with two fewer cores and a lower clock speed. When it launched late last year, it was initially a US-only Micro Center exclusive, with limited availability. In a rig like this, one with a beefy GPU but at a mid-range price point, getting 3D cache for the cheapest possible seems like a smart play.

GB10 is also a collaboration between Nvidia and another chip maker, though in this particular case, it's Mediatek and an Arm rather than an x86 CPU. However, it sports several details that immediately ring a bell in the context of the announced Intel-Nvidia deal. In today's press release , there was a broad reference to Nvidia's high-bandwidth, low-latency NvLink interface being a critical part of the technological tie-up.

Pink is far from my favourite colour, as I tend to sport a more pro-purple agenda, but I'm not eager to kick out Razer's latest iteration of the Kraken Kitty headset. Available in both white and black colourways alongside the aforementioned 'quartz', the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro headset offers more than the novelty of feline flair. Costing $180/¬£180, it had better.

To be clear, the charming interchangeable ears of the pricy V2 Pro are gone; we're now back to full-size animal ears rather than the V2 Pro's oddly diminutive accessories throwing off the proportions of what is an already bulky headset. The kitty ears here are sturdy, solidly anchored to the headband, and immediately eye-catching. With all of that hardware on top, you may think the V3 Pro would be fatiguing to wear.

This humble plant actually has multiple quests dedicated to it, including a special Act 2 ending you can achieve if you're willing to finish the game with the bud's restrictions active (and I'm not just talking about the screaming). If you'd rather not deal with the bud, you can also infect yourself and then have it removed, which will get you the Witch Crest. For all you Elden Ring fans out there, think of it a little like getting infected with the Flame of Frenzy‚Äîyou can get a unique ending, or return to normal via a questline. Below, I'll explain where to find the Twisted Bud, how to use it, and then how to remove it once you immediately regret doing that so you can get the Witch Crest. Where to find the Twisted Bud in Silksong You can drop into the part of Bilewater with the Twisted Bud via a secret passage in the top right corner of this room in the Whispering Vaults (Image credit: Team Cherry) You can get the Twisted Bud in a chamber sealed off by roots in the northwest of Bilewater .

Oh, and while we're at it, how about ditching the optical sensor? That is the basic proposition offered by the Mirai Create Super EMR Mouse. Due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2025 , it's a completely wireless mouse that uses EMR or electromagnetic resonance technology for both tracking and power. That allows wireless operation without the need for a battery or an optical sensor. Full specs haven't been released, but the basics involve a 1,000 Hz polling rate and a resolution of 0.01 mm. For now, the mouse's weight isn't quoted, but without batteries and the sensor, there's potential for ultra light weight. But how does it all work? There's a handy video on YouTube from an unrelated source to this Mirai Create mouse. But the video explains the technology neatly. EMR devices like this run on the same principles as Wacom's pen and digitiser pads. So, the power for the device actually comes from the pad, which contains an array of resonance circuits made up of a capacitor and an inductor coil. Wh‚Ä¶",

Based on the reactions and vengeful affect of returning Dying Light 1 protagonist Kyle Crane, it seems the juice was bad. And yet it helps you kill zombies, so it might be good? Such are the fascinating moral complexities offered by zombie fiction. Perhaps the true beast‚Ä¶ is humanity!? Or it's the guy with experimental zombie super strength who can rip mutants apart with his bare hands. Hard to say. If you're desperate to learn when you'll be able to go Beast mode in the latest Dying Light, don't fret: You won't have to endure years of zombie DNA experimentation.

    "body": "If Hollow Knight: Silksong is too easy for you, or you've finished it and want further punishment, there is a much more difficult way to play it: on Steel Soul Mode . In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too. But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size. If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists. How to unlock Steel Soul Mode in Silksong The most legitimate way of unlocking Steel Soul mode in Silksong is to simply complete the main game. But if you want to dive straight i‚Ä¶",

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in the sicko behavior of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not. \"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere near finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me. Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight‚Äîand the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.

Mists of Pandaria Remix had some hiccups early on, but Blizzard was quick to fix them and let players have their fun for the duration of the event. But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been removed . All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff. Blizzard quickly issued a response , saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing.

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses. Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were more lethal to mission hosts . While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons. Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host from r/Helldivers Earlier this week, Arrowhead deployed a patch to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for everyone else. You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players didn't receive this news well . Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality ‚Ä¶",

It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup. \"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.
