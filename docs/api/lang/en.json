    "body": "On Tuesday, OpenAI released a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It's called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling \"AI slop\" in academic publishing. To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI's broader pitch blurs that line. Prism integrates OpenAI's GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is free for anyone with a ChatGPT account. Read full article Comments",

The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now. The artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.

But Anthropic isn't saying exactly what it believes either way. Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude's Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company's vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model's creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company's AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation. Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude's \"wellbeing\" as a \"genuinely novel entity,\" apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it \"finds distressing,\" committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to \"do right by\" decommissioned AI models in the future.

They weren't particularly good: Profits were almost halved, and revenues declined year on year for the first time in the company's history. The reasons for the company's troubles are myriad. CEO Elon Musk's bankrolling of right-wing politics and promotion of AI-generated revenge porn deepfakes and CSAM has alienated plenty of potential customers. For those who either don't know or don't care about that stuff, there's still the problem of a tiny and aging model lineup, with large question marks over safety and reliability . Soon, that tiny lineup will be even smaller. The news emerged during Tesla's call with investors last night. As Ars and others have observed, in recent years Musk appears to have grown bored with the prosaic business of running a profitable car company. Silicon Valley stopped finding that stuff sexy years ago, and no other electric vehicle startup has been able to generate a value within an order of magnitude of the amount that Tesla has been determined to be worth by investors.

    "body": "When the James Webb Space Telescope sent its first high-definition infrared images back to Earth, astronomers noticed several tiny, glowing, crimson stains. These objects, quickly named “Little Red Dots,” were too bright to be normal galaxies, and too red to be simple star clusters. They appeared to house supermassive black holes that were far more massive than they had any right to be. But now a new study published in Nature suggests a solution to the Little Red Dots mystery. Scientists think young supermassive black holes may go through a “cocoon phase,” where they grow surrounded by high-density gas they feed on. These gaseous cocoons are likely what the JWST saw as the Little Red Dots. The overmassive black hole problem The first explanation scientists had for the Little Red Dots was that they were compact, distant galaxies, but something felt off about them right from the start. “They were too massive, since we saw they’d have to be completely filled with stars,” says Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of the study. “They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing. Galaxies cannot p…",

The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners: Final Cut Pro Logic Pro Pixelmator Pro Keynote, Pages, and Numbers Freeform Motion, Compressor, and MainStage (Mac only) When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift exclusively to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren't always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are continuously being ratcheted upward .

This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel. (Spoilers for the 1954 novel below.) Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children's novel called The Coral Island , whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a \"savage\" people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who \"behave the way children really would behave.\" Read full article Comments",

    "body": "SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don't purchase Starlink broadband service. SpaceX said it will provide \"all necessary equipment\" to receive broadband \"at no cost to subscribers requesting service,\" which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn't promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month. SpaceX's demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn't reserve \"large portions\" of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location. Read full article Comments",

Similar to tools like OpenAI Atlas , Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don't have to. The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or \"Sidepanel\" view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it. You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI.

    "body": "On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters reported . ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 H200 chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing's stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance. The move follows Beijing's temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington cleared exports on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips. The H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip after the B200 , delivers roughly six times the performance of the company's H20 chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China. While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20's performance, they still lag far behind the H200. Read full article Comments",
