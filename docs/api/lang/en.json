    "body": "Credit: Andy Walker / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s own virtual assistant Bixby may soon be powered by an AI chatbot. Samsung is rumored to have partnered with Perplexity, a Google DeepMind and OpenAI rival, for new Bixby capabilities. These features would be available to Samsung users starting with the Galaxy S26. Bixby, Samsung’s homespun virtual assistant , has always been overshadowed by more popular options such as Gemini , Siri, and Alexa. On other smart devices, such as Samsung TVs and talking refrigerators, Bixby is the default voice assistant. However, on Android devices under Samsung’s Galaxy range, Gemini takes precedence over Bibxy, and Samsung doesn’t oppose either. One of the reasons for Bixby’s lack of popularity is the limited AI features compared to its rivals. However, that could be changing soon — as soon as early 2026, when Bixby might receive a deeper integration of Perplexity’s AI chatbot. According to leaker with the handle @chunvn8888 on X , Samsung is testing Perplexity’s integration into Bixby on its smartphones and tablets. The feature, they say, is set to arrive with the launch of the Galaxy S26 series next year.",

It’s been a while since I’ve actually struggled to get a modern flagship to start fast charging. Like any normal person, I took my new Find X9 Pro out of the box and tried plugging it into my existing charger setup . That went OK, if not a little slow (more on that later). But I also wanted to compare my desk charger against an official 80W OPPO SuperVOOC plug, so I gave that a try as well. The phone wouldn’t charge at a rate above 22W-27W — far short of its claimed 80W charging potential.",

Sure, you could spend thousands on a cutting-edge robot vacuum that can physically lift socks and other debris , but most people don’t need that. Even as someone who lives on the bleeding edge of tech, I’m perfectly content with a vacuum that just keeps my floors clean. And the good news is that robot vacuums have become shockingly accessible. But shopping for one is confusing: you’ll find a myriad of brands, some of which you might’ve never seen before, and model names that don’t make much sense.",

And even though it requires enabling sharing for “Everyone for 10 minutes” on both devices, it’s seamless and brilliant, and makes me wonder why we couldn’t have had this years ago. However, the unexpected news has certainly left many of us scratching our heads. We first suspected the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) had something to do with it, but since Google essentially went rogue and implemented it without Apple’s help , it seems that’s not the case. The timing is certainly “interesting,” though. Still, I have some questions and concerns about this bold Google move.",

That said, it rather forces the user to adopt this ideology. It’s no wonder then that plenty of users leap for other Android launchers offering fresher features and extensive customization options. Fortunately, it appears that Google is addressing this issue. According to evidence we uncovered in Android Canary, the Pixel Launcher will soon give users the option to hide its At a Glance widget completely from the home screen. The widget, positioned right at the top of the screen, is helpful in certain instances. It serves context-relevant information, including weather forecasts, flight details, and traffic information via Maps for commuters. Not everyone values this information, though, and since At a Glance is permanent, it robs these users of real estate on their home screens.",

Eventually, mass-deleting emails and photos to free up cloud storage space took its toll, and soon I found myself paying $2 a month for Google One Basic. That only solved my data cap problems for one Google account; not long after, I shelled out for Google One Premium to share 2TB of cloud storage across all my accounts. Subscriptions can get out of hand quickly, so Google One Premium at $10 per month was all I could muster. Despite owning multiple Nest displays and a Nest Video Doorbell, I stuck with only three hours of event recording to avoid paying another $10 for Nest Aware each month. Plus, my smart home is split between the Apple and Google ecosystems. Paying for Apple One gave me an unlimited number of HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) cameras with a 10-day recording history, making Nest Aware hard to justify.",

Interested customers can snag six months of access for just $36, paying only $5.99 per month. Apple recently raised the regular price of Apple TV to $12.99 in August, making this Black Friday deal particularly sweet. Apple TV, the rebranded streaming service formerly known as Apple TV+, seems to have another hit in the viral Pluribus series. However, it’s more expensive than ever to get started binging Apple TV titles. The streaming service hiked prices from $9.99 to $12.99 per month in August for new and existing subscribers. If you found those prices too expensive, Apple TV’s limited-time Black Friday promotion slashes the streaming service’s monthly price by more than half for six months. It’s available now for new and eligible returning subscribers, so interested customers should take advantage of it now.",

The galaxy in question is NGC 2775, which lies 67 million light-years away in the constellation Cancer (the Crab). NGC 2775 sports a smooth, featureless center that is devoid of gas, resembling an elliptical galaxy. It also has a dusty ring with patchy star clusters, like a spiral galaxy. Which is it: spiral or elliptical — or neither? Because we can only view NGC 2775 from one angle, it’s difficult to say for sure. Some researchers classify NGC 2775 as a spiral galaxy because of its feathery ring of stars and dust, while others classify it as a lenticular galaxy. Lenticular galaxies have features common to both spiral and elliptical galaxies. Astronomers aren’t certain of exactly how lenticular galaxies come to be, and they might form in a variety of ways. Lenticular galaxies might be spiral galaxies that merged with other galaxies, or that have mostly run out of star-forming gas and lost their prominent spiral arms. T…",

Last year, Google finally released its answer to AirDrop, Quick Share, giving Android devices their own seamless sharing system. Now, for the first time ever, Google has done the unthinkable and brought AirDrop and Quick Share together . No longer is Quick Share limited to sending files to other Android devices — it can now send files just as easily to iPhones and other Apple gadgets via AirDrop.",

Several Kindle models have officially dropped to some of the best prices we’ve seen this year, including a budget-friendly deal on the basic model. Whether you’re curling up for winter or gift-giving to your favorite bookworm, the lineup has rarely looked this appealing! Kindle (2024) For anyone after a simple, distraction-free reading device, the basic Kindle is the budget-friendly pick this Black Friday. It has a 6-inch, 300ppi glare-free display, 16GB of storage, and multiple weeks of battery life, all wrapped in a lightweight frame that’s easy to carry anywhere. It’s not waterproof, and it doesn’t have page-turn buttons, but for pure reading, it’s the most affordable entry point to the Kindle ecosystem. At this price, it’s easily one of the best e-reader values of the season.",

Thanks to the ever-increasing prices of music streaming services and the occasional introduction of new features, many people are interested in switching between services like Spotify , YouTube Music, and Apple Music. Users have had to resort to third-party tools to migrate between services, but lately, these platforms have made it easier for users to hop on and bring their playlists along.

Google Photos has been around for over a decade and has offered a built-in photo editor throughout that duration. Even though its native photo editor wasn’t initially as sophisticated as Google Snapseed — it only received advanced editing features in 2020 — and did not have AI-backed editing chops until recently, one trait has always remained constant. That is the background color of the editor interface, which has always been dark gray. Now, Google appears to have finally meditated on it and might be working to add a new light theme.",
