Here we are, howling at the moon for decades-old modes, \"grounded\" character models, classic class setups, and a map from 2011. Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 has impressed me. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year.

I knew from the first time I got my hands on it last year that it had the potential to be the kind of game MMO players have wanted for a long time—including me. And Fellowship just kept improving each time I saw it. The pitch is simple: It's MMO-style dungeons but without the MMO grind. You party up in a group of four—one tank, one healer, two damage-dealers—and work together to clear out packs of enemies and bosses for better and better loot. There's no need to level up a character and churn through hundreds of quests. You pick one of the game's MOBA-like heroes, queue up, and spam dungeons for as long as you'd like. It's one of those ideas that I am surprised nobody really capitalized on for this long. There are plenty of World of Warcraft players who play the game purely for the thrill of grouping up and doing dungeons. Fellowship is trying to fill a niche that surprisingly doesn't really exist elsewhere. And that's what drove Chief Rebel to make Fellowship as its first game.

A time when nobody expected you to have the right models because half the things in the rulebook didn't even have models yet. That said, the first edition of Warhammer 40,000 was supposedly a complete mess rules-wise—borderline unplayable without a degree from Wargame University. How true are these things?

But while Ubisoft said it was \"deeply grateful\" for his impact on the Assassin's Creed games and \"saddened to see him go,\" it was also apparently the company's idea that he leave. \"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it,\" Côté wrote in an emotional, occasionally gutting message posted on LinkedIn . \"The truth is simple: I did not make that choice. \"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.

A quick catch-up for those who missed the drama that brought us to this point: Ubisoft shut down servers for The Crew in April 2024, rendering the game unplayable and triggering a furious consumer backlash in the process. Ubisoft's ham-fisted handling of the situation didn't help smooth the waters, but it did get the message, promising in September of that year to bring offline support to The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest . Testing for The Crew 2's offline mode began earlier this year, and as of today it's fully live. \"With this update, players can now switch between the original online experience of The Crew 2 and a brand-new offline mode, letting you enjoy the game even without an internet connection,\" Ubisoft said. \"This represents a major milestone in our ongoing commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.\" After the new update is installed, players will be prompted t…",

While Dwarf Fortress history is dense with elaborate defensive superstructures like weaponized magma flows, pits full of war bears, and the trusty dwarven atom smasher , the underlying strategy has been defined by a simple principle: Goblin war hosts can only follow the paths you leave open. As a result, if the only way into your fortress is a meat grinder of boulder traps, sawblades, and entrenched dwarven infantry, goblin besiegers have had no choice but to march headlong into red ruin. Once the siege update lands in a couple weeks, however, invading forces will be leveling the playing field.

With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest videogame developers and publishers in the world,\" the union said. \"EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed. Noting that EA had to take on nearly $20 billion in debt to finance the deal—PC Gamer's Lincoln Carpenter has a detailed explainer of the \"leveraged buyout,\" if you want to know why so many people are deeply worried about how this is going to work out—the union expressed particular concern about t…",

The list of permanent updates Blizzard plans to implement in its next season bring foundational reworks to loot and combat that will trickle down into the rest of the game. All of it will be on the PTR next week to test out, but so far it seems like Diablo 4 is about to become a tougher but more satisfying action RPG. Monsters will be meaner and your gear will be more customizable to help you face them. Old systems are returning in new ways and leaderboards are finally back. The change with the most impact—and the most risk of under-delivering—is with combat. Blizzard says monster behavior was “too predictable,” in a draft of a blog post it provided to PC Gamer, and that it’s tweaking things to give each demon a stronger identity. On paper, this sounds like Diablo 4 combat might actually require some target priority, like taking care of a caster in the backline before the tank in the front. I’ve mindlessly torn through enough dungeons in the last few years to be a little skeptical about how much this will shift the feel of combat when your character is fully geared, but it sounds promising.

    "body": "So, Nvidia's little gold box of pure AI power, the DGX Spark is finally out. But is it any good? The answer depends who's doing the asking and what they're asking of the Spark. By some common measures, it's no faster than another small box based on AMD's Strix Halo chip that's available for about half the price. Ouch. Much of this comes down to the minor matter of floating point math precision. I can feel your eyes glazing over, but bear with me. The finer details aren't that important. All you really need to know is that lowering the floating point precision being used can speed up performance at the cost of eventual AI model accuracy. Oh, and that like all Nvidia hardware based on its latest Blackwell technology, the DGX Spark has special optimisations for the lowest and fastest tier of floating point math, known as FP4. In the simplest possible terms, you'll get better results from your AI model with a higher precision like FP8, but it'll run slower. And a lot slower than a GPU with FP4 optimisations. With all that in mind, how does DGX Spark stack up and how does it compared with AMD's Strix Halo chip? Right out of the, er, little gold box, it's worth noting that a DGX Spark w…",

Itagaki was an absolutely transformative figure in contemporary action games thanks to his work at Tecmo, the company he joined in 1992: he led Team Ninja and spearheaded the revival of Ninja Gaiden, as well as creating the Dead or Alive series. He would leave Tecmo under a cloud in 2008, before founding Valhalla Game Studios and releasing Devil's Third on Wii U. Itagaki was known for his sunglasses, pockmarked skin and outspoken interviews, but it was the fact that he and Team Ninja could back up the bluster that made him one of the great creators of the early 2000s. The first 3D Ninja Gaiden, released in 2004, took on Capcom and DMC at its own game and, by my reckoning anyway, beat it handily. That and Ninja Gaiden 2 remain two of the finest hack-and-slash games ever made. The news of Itagaki's death comes from a post to his Facebook page , and PCG has been able to confirm the news via a personal friend of the late developer. That post is titled \"Words to Leave\" and begins, via machine translation: The light of my life is about to run out. The fact that this sentence has been posted means it's finally time. …",

I've been testing out one of the newest: The beta version of MSI's AI-powered EZ PC Builder tool , which promises to \"guide beginners to complete PC configuration easily\" —and while my early tests were surprisingly promising, like most AI helpers, it could certainly do with some work. I started out by telling it I wanted to build a PC for 4K gaming, to which it asked me what CPU I would prefer—AMD or Intel. Hmm. A slight fall at the first hurdle, that, as I'd imagine many beginners wouldn't know the difference between the two. Or even what \"CPU\" might stand for, for that matter. Playing dumb, however, and asking which was faster, resulted in a surprisingly measured response. \"For 4K gaming specifically, both AMD and Intel’s latest high-end CPUs perform excellently!\" said the AI. \"At 4K resolution, your graphics card becomes the primary performance factor rather than the CPU, so the difference between top-tier AMD and Intel processors is minimal in most 4K gaming sc…",

And early leaked benchmarks of the chip suggest the new M5 is about twice as fast as the original M1 for single-thread performance. So, the question is, why can't PC CPUs make those kinds of gains? The immediate context here is the accuracy of the leaked benchmark and the actual performance gains of PC processors over the same time period. So, first off, the leaked numbers look plausible. That's because the M4 already had very high single-thread performance and the M5 leaked numbers look to have pushed that on 10% to 15% depending on which precise Apple platforms you are comparing. Now you might dismiss 10% to 15% as your usual generational gain similar to PC chips. And it is. Except Apple is iterating on a nearly annual basis, with the M1 launching in November 2020 and the M5 now with us in late 2025. Intel and AMD tend to take two years to release major new architectures. That more rapid Apple cadence adds up pretty fast as the years tick by. How fast?

While I enjoyed my time with the Kraken Kitty V3 Pro , I'm still not a huge fan of the headset's pastel pink 'quartz' colourway. So, when I heard the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is now available outside of Asia , I was there with my Pokeballs at the ready. Obviously, there are a few key differences to note between the V3 Pro and this pretty purple version of the V2. Besides the kitty ears getting swapped out for the ghostie's wee purple horns, the main difference is that the Gengar Razer Kitty Kraken V2 is a wired headset. That means a stable, constant connection at the risk of forgetting about the wire all together and potentially dragging your rig behind you when you leave your desk…but what sort of Slowpoke would do that, right?

Although its brief reveal trailer welcomed us to the new setting, there's now more than enough information for us to sink our teeth into ahead of its release. We already knew Tinkerbell and Snow White would be a part of the DLC as they were shown in the original trailer, but Tigger and Cruella de Vil will now be joining us too. Both will play a significant part in the story, with Cruella essentially taking the role of the villain having left the ranch to decay over time. Tigger, however, will be lost somewhere amongst the new biomes of the map and it will be our job to find him.

But it turns out that Minecraft 's devs probably wouldn't have added it based on their current design goals. That's per a recent dev blog (thanks, GamesRadar+ ). See, present-day Minecraft has a few core principles. The relevant ones to everyone's least favourite critter are \"be fair to players\", \"bad things can happen, but they're technically the player's fault\", \"find the right level of destruction\", and \"don't add features that wreck player's builds.\" If you're sitting here thinking 'hey, wait a second, those are all things that the Creeper does!' then you'd be right. As Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten says in the video linked above, \"If you followed the rules we have today, you would probably not add the creeper, because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster that would show up and just destroy what you built.\" However, the \"creeper is very iconic\", which seems in direct conflict with all those lovely pre-established rules.

The results indicate that material created with machine learning tools initially overtook human-written content late last year. However, the data also shows the proportion of AI-generated material plateauing. In fact, the rapid growth of AI content actually begins to slow in the data around mid-2023. Two immediate questions spring from this. First, why is AI content plateauing? Second, how accurate is this study likely to be? Five Percent addresses both of these queries. \"While AI-generated articles grew dramatically after ChatGPT launched, we do not see that trend continuing. Instead, the proportion of AI-generated articles has remained relatively stable over the last 12 months.

It can feel like running through treacle trying to rank up, level weapons for attachments, and perhaps most painful of all, to complete the many arduous assignments—not helped by a prominent bug causing assignments not to track . Whether through fear of players unlocking everything right away and getting bored, or in an effort to curtail those who would inevitably use Portal as an XP farm , it's not working out well for anyone. Portal servers totally aren't inundated with private bot matches to cheese progression to the point that this creative mode isn't actually serving its purpose. Or at least, that's what I'd say if I were lying.

We already had an idea of what, and more specifically who, would be coming as part of this update thanks to a teaser shared earlier in the year, but it's nice to finally see the characters in-game. The Winter Ball will bring Cinderella to the game, one of the characters players have been desperate to invite to their valley since it launched. Even though the roster gets bigger every single year, there's still a pretty significant lack of original princesses, so having updates like this one is always exciting, even though we've still got a couple of months to wait before we get to meet her. The showcase also gave some info on who else will show up as we unlock Cinderella.

Though, it wouldn't be unusual for Dreamlight Valley to throw in some curveballs either. It currently seems like \"early 2026\" will bring Lady and the Tramp, as suggested by a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs in a Parisian street. Then, it looks like Pocahontas will be joining us in spring, as symbolised by a raccoon sat next to her necklace and a gust of orange leaves. Finally, a statue of Phil in a biome that looks a lot like Mythopia, alongside Hercules' sandals suggests that Hercules may be coming in Summer.

It's a clever foldable mouse that can be squashed flat to a mere 5 mm thick—but every time I look at the photos and think about holding one, something uncomfortable happens to the back of my neck. I think it's got something to do with the texture of the materials (two different forms of vegan leather, apparently) in combination with the angle of the \"hump\" that would rest in the centre of your palm, which looks to be almost a corner. An inevitable result of the foldable design, I assume, but it gives me a proper case of the heebie-jeebies when I think about placing my hand on one. Which, let's face it, is probably a me thing.

We're still waiting for a new Splinter Cell game and it's been more than a decade since the last one, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which was released way back in 2013. And even though Ubisoft has confirmed that it's working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell, we haven't heard hardly anything about it in several years. I even took the opportunity to ask Splinter Cell: Blacklist director Guillaume Dousse if he could shed some light on the next Splinter Cell game when we chatted last week, but he regretfully said he didn't have \"the security clearance\" to get us any new info. Ah well, I tried.

But as this clip from Charlie Intel demonstrates on X, standing on a stationary recon drone and clonking it with a sledgehammer causes an almost-definitely-unintended physics interaction that launches the drone and its surfer directly upwards. Because the motion isn't coming from the drone pilot's inputs, the rider is able to keep their footing.

Hell, it even runs like a dream . That's not to say the game's entirely without issues, of course, and one persistent grumble since launch has been about Conquest mode, which is arguably the series' 'main' mode and one you'll likely be spending a lot of time in. The problem is time itself: Conquest is a mode designed around each team having a set number of 'reinforcement tickets', which tick down as the match progresses—the first team to run out of tickets loses. Battlefield 6 added a timer to Conquest, something that wasn't present in previous Battlefield games, and so players have run into a repeated issue where matches are finishing before either team has run out of tickets. You can easily see why this is a problem. The great thing about Conquest is comebacks and how a declining ticket count affects your team: players notice when the number's getting low, play more cautiously, and every kill starts to feel…",
