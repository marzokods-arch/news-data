However, they largely failed to live up to this promise. In fact, some smart speakers, including those in Google’s Home ecosystem , have even seen a significant decline in reliability. This decline raises the question of what, if anything, tech companies are doing to reverse the trend. Google’s answer is to bring its Gemini AI into the smart home. Unveiled this week, Gemini for Home upgrades the conversational experience in Google Home smart speakers, displays, doorbells, and cameras with AI, while also introducing smarter media controls, improved alerts, and more intelligent search capabilities.",

I tried Business Calendar 2 and Digical, and both presented viable alternatives with plenty of value adds. However, and this is important, neither of these apps is an independent platform — they both still rely on Google Calendar to save and serve events. To find a true G Cal alternative, I’d have to look elsewhere. That’s where my curiosity about Proton Calendar comes in. Perhaps best known for its VPN and mail clients, the Swiss-based company Proton offers users a complete calendaring platform independent of Google Calendar. Proton Calendar is one of the front-running contenders for those who want to deGoogle their devices and their lives. But is it any good? Well, I tried it, and I have mixed feelings.",

When Google announced 100x Pro Res Zoom on its new Pixel 10 Pro lineup — which uses AI to enhance a very digitally-zoomed-in photo — that question of what makes a photo a photo rang loudly in my mind. Does it really matter how the photo is created if you like the end result and it looks like what it’s supposed to look like? Well, that depends, and we’ll get to that, but first let’s dive in and take a look at what this 100x zoom looks like in real-life use. As far as the eye can see…and then some I was shocked the first time I scrolled all the way to the right on the zoom slider, snapped my photo, then watched the sparkles dance around on my screen as Google’s artificial intelligence worked to recreate and enhance what I only saw as a grainy, pixelated scene on my screen. Within a few moments, the dancing pixels dissolved to reveal the final result: an incredibly detailed and very accurate photograph of a scene that I could hardly see with my own eyes. Consider me mind-blown. That moment truly felt shocking.",

They failed for a variety of reasons — like price, redundancy, and utility — but the seeds they planted for a future of fully automated apps stuck around. These seeds grew into the “agentic AI” trend we see today. Companies are racing to build AI products that can perform tasks on your behalf, like helping you code a new project, booking an appointment, or ordering items online.

I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths . Many of those points still hold, but awareness has improved, and so has prepaid market penetration. When you remove some of the most common myths from the equation, what are the real reasons people still don’t switch to prepaid?

    "body": "Spotify is the first name in music streaming, but from an increasingly jam-packed app interface to concerns about artist payout and leadership conduct , it’s not hard to come up with reasons a music fan might want to consider other options. It’s a crowded field, filled with heavy-hitting alternatives like YouTube Music, Tidal, Deezer, and more. In a recent poll , we asked which of a few other apps you prefer — and there’s a clear winner. Given the choice between Bandcamp, Deezer, SoundCloud, Tidal, and YouTube Music, Google’s music app came out ahead by a wide margin. Nearly half of survey respondents preferred YouTube Music — taking out the “other” option, YouTube Music got more votes than all the other options in our survey combined.",

By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence.

Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Google rolled out Scheduled Actions for Gemini in June, allowing users to trigger tasks at a specific time of the day automatically. This was a boon for those who create daily digests and want them to run without intervention. However, there was one small problem: these actions were a nightmare to edit. Thanks to a small but significant change, Google is making it much easier to edit Scheduled Actions directly from the Gemini app.",

At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns .

This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay.

At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses.

    "body": "Credit: Reddit user T-K-Tronix TL;DR A Reddit user attached M.2 SSD heatsinks to their iPhone 17 Pro Max for extreme cooling. The mod, although bulky and aesthetically unappealing, significantly improves the phone’s sustained performance beyond what Apple has already achieved with the move to vapor chambers. The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs. But what if you wanted even better performance with even more heat dissipation and cooling? We’ve seen a few crazy cooling mods for phones, and this latest one attaches a bunch of SSD heatsinks onto the back of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The leak corroborates the feature activates automatically in crowded spaces. It also suggests users will have the option to choose which aspects to restrict and which ones to allow. The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung lets Galaxy Watch users track their sleep and computes a “sleep score” number. Recently, some Galaxy Watch owners have noticed their sleep scores rising through the stratosphere. With no obvious behavioral changes to blame, this may be due to a change in the sleep score algorithm. Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of. But are you sure you can trust that data? Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Last month, this stopped working, and Gemini will only create new pictures that are square. Google says that it’s working on a fix, and there are some workaround you can use until then. If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place. But what’s currently going on with Gemini and image generation is proving to be nothing short of maddening.",

The deal applies to the Visible Plus Pro plan, which offers premium features such as unlimited 5G UW data, hotspot use, smartwatch service, and international perks. This limited-time offer is available until November 3 and includes taxes and fees in the monthly price. Visible is likely the prepaid service I recommend the most to those looking for a low-cost alternative to postpaid without noticeably sacrificing network performance, and that’s especially true for its Visible Plus and Visible Plus Pro plans. While the most expensive of these options typically runs for $45 a month (taxes and fees included), what if you could get six months of service for just $22.50 a month ?

Maybe as a consequence of us reaching that smart home plateau, new hardware from Google has been few and far between.
