Nearly seven years after the famous Marvel Comics creator’s death at the age of 95 , fans will be able to pay $15 to $20 this weekend to chat with a life-sized, AI-powered avatar of Lee in an enclosed booth at the show. The instant response from many fans and media outlets to the idea was not kind, to say the least. A writer for TheGamer called the very idea \"demonic\" and said we need to \"kill it with fire before it’s too late.\" The AV Club urged its readers not to pay to see \"the anguished digital ghost of a beloved comic book creator, repurposed as a trap for chumps!\" Reactions on a popular Reddit thread ranged from calling it \"incredibly disrespectful\" and \"in bad taste\" to \"ghoulish\" and \"so fucked up,\" with very little that was more receptive to the concept. But Chris DeMoulin, the CEO of the parent company behind LA Comic Con, urged critics to come see the AI-powered hologram for themselves before rushing to judgment. \"We're not afraid of people seeing it and we're not afraid of criticism,\" he told Ars. \"I’m just a fan of informed crit…",

That's the premise behind ongoing research at the University of Cambridge, where scientists are using satellite imagery and AI models to map potential hedgehog habitats across the UK by first identifying their favorite hiding spots: bramble patches. European hedgehog populations have declined by roughly 30 to 50 percent over the past decade, so tracking these nocturnal creatures across large areas remains difficult and expensive. Rather than searching for the hedgehogs directly, researcher Gabriel Mahler developed an AI model that identifies brambles, which are thorny shrubs that hedgehogs use for shelter and foraging, from satellite data. These small mammals rely on this type of dense vegetation for daytime shelter, nesting sites, and protection from predators. Brambles also attract insects and provide berries, supporting the invertebrate populations that hedgehogs eat. Read full article Comments",

She told doctors that for the past month she had developed severe nausea, non-bloody vomiting, and pain she described as a burning feeling that spread from her upper abdomen, through her right side, and around to her back. Nothing she did made it better. The doctors started collecting her medical history, which was lengthy. The woman had Type 2 diabetes, Stage 2 chronic kidney disease, opioid use disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), among other conditions. While she was taking many medications, she noted that for the past year she had also been taking semaglutide, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, and had lost about 40 pounds (over 19 percent of her body weight).

However, I can't help thinking that the answer for a TV that truly prioritizes the needs of older people is much simpler—and cheaper. On Thursday, LG announced the Easy TV in South Korea, aiming it at the “senior TV market,” according to a Google translation of the press release . One of the features that LG has included in attempts to appeal to this demographic is a remote control with numbers. Many remotes for smart TVs, streaming sticks, and boxes don’t have numbered buttons, with much of the controller's real estate dedicated to other inputs. The Easy TV's remote. Credit: LG LG released a new version of its Magic Remote in January with a particularly limited button selection that is likely to confuse or frustrate newcomers. In addition to not having keys for individual numbers, there are no buttons for switching inputs, play/pause, or fast forward/rewind. Read full article Comments",

As interest in DIY keyboards expands , there are plenty of things to obsess over, such as keycap sets, layout, knobs, and switches. But you have to get deep into the hobby before you realize there's something more important than all that: the stabilizers. Even if you have the fanciest switches and a monolithic aluminum case, bad stabilizers can make a keyboard feel and sound like garbage. Luckily, there's a growing ecosystem of weirdly fancy stabilizers that can upgrade your typing experience, packing an impressive amount of innovation into a few tiny bits of plastic and metal. What is a stabilizer, and why should you care? Most keys on a keyboard are small enough that they go up and down evenly, no matter where you press. That's not the case for longer keys: Space, Enter, Shift, Backspace, and, depending on the layout, a couple more on the number pad. These keys have wire assemblies underneath called stabilizers, which help them go up and down when the switch does. Read full article Comments",

On Sunday, Trump told Fox News that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox Corporation, would likely be part of the investor group taking over TikTok's US operations. That deal—which Trump claimed Thursday was tentatively approved by Chinese President Xi Jinping—was set up to ensure that TikTok complies with a law banning majority ownership of the app by a foreign adversary in order to protect Americans from spying or foreign influence on the algorithm.

But it’s probably one of the first shots we have at making healing guns real. 3D printing on the fly In more complex bone problems like severe, irregular fractures or resections done as part of bone cancer treatment, the bone won’t heal on its own. The most common means of stabilizing the injured site and making recovery possible is metal-based grafts, implants usually made with titanium alloys. The problem with such implants is that they are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and it’s very hard to make them patient-specific. “3D printing has been highlighted as a novel approach to make such personalized implants, but this also requires substantial time and money,” said Jung Seung Lee, a biomedical engineering researcher at the Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. So his team wanted to find a way to make bone implants that would be faster and cheaper than a 3D printer. Read full article Comments",

But they waited all the way until Thursday night to reveal preorder pricing set at $599.99 for the base ROG Xbox Ally hardware and a whopping $999.99 for the souped-up ROG Xbox Ally X. Those prices put the baseline ROG Xbox Ally units in the same general price tier as competition like Valve's Steam Deck OLED , Lenovo's Legion Go S , and even Nintendo's Switch 2 . But the higher-grade ROG Xbox Ally X is significantly more expensive than almost all competing gaming handhelds, thanks in part to components like a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and an NPU that Asus says will ensure it is ready for a future when \"AI enhancements\" are rolling out in new games. That may seem like overkill when Steam Deck users seem content using their handheld mainly for low-end games like Vampire Survivors and Hades . But Asus said that, in pre-release hardware tests, the ROG Xbox Ally X gets \"up to a 30% performance boost\" over 2024's ROG Ally X on high-end games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle . The newer hardware also gets \"up to twice the battery life\" over the ROG Ally…",

With so many rocket launches happening around the world, some might want to dismiss these statements as a corporate plea for more competition, and therefore lower prices. SpaceX is on pace to launch more than 150 times this year. China could end the year with more than 70 orbital launches. These are staggering numbers compared to global launch rates just a few years ago. But I'm convinced there's room for more alternatives for reliable (and reusable) rockets. All of the world's planned mega-constellations will need immense launch capacity just to get off the ground, and if successful, they'll go into regular replacement and replenishment cycles. Throw in the still-undefined Golden Dome missile shield and many nations' desire for a sovereign launch capability, and it's easy to see the demand curve going up.

    "body": "In late 2017, a study by Krefeld Entomological Society looked at protected areas across Germany and discovered that two-thirds of the insect populations living in there had vanished over the last 25 years. The results spurred the media to declare we’re living through an “insect apocalypse,” but the reasons behind their absence were unclear. Now, a joint team of Japanese and Australian scientists have completed a new, multi-year study designed to get us some answers. Insect microcosm “In our work, we focused on ants because we have systematic ways for collecting them,” says Alexander Mikheyev, an evolutionary biologist at the Australian National University. “They are also a group with the right level of diversity, where you have enough species to do comparative studies.” Choosing the right location, he explained, was just as important. “We did it in Fiji, because Fiji had the right balance between isolation—which gave us a discrete group of animals to study—but at the same time was diverse enough to make comparisons,” Mikheyev adds. Thus, the Fijian archipelago, with its 330 islands, became the model the team used to get some insights into insect population dynamics. A key differen…",
