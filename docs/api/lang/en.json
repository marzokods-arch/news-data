This was unusual, as Google traditionally publishes the source code for new Android versions within a day or two of their release. After telling Android Authority it would release the code “in the coming weeks,” the company has now made good on that promise. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Turn-by-turn navigation in Google Maps is one of the most battery-intensive tasks you can do on an Android phone. That’s because it requires continuous use of location services and mobile data to fetch directions, all while keeping the display powered on to show you the way. While location and data services are demanding on their own, keeping the screen on at or near full brightness is what truly drains the battery.

Subscribers have been offered a $20 credit for the missing channels, and they remain unavailable. Now a report specifically identifies ESPN pricing as the hurdle that’s holding up negotiations. YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

Code found in Google Play services indicates that may be changing. It’s unclear when private pass syncing may be released. Google Wallet supports a document type Google calls generic private passes . As opposed to other pass types — store loyalty cards or concert tickets, for example — private passes come with extra security features meant to help keep critical information attached to documents like government IDs or health insurance cards private. One of those security features is that private passes can only exist on a single device at one time, but it looks like that could be changing. Experimenting with the latest version of Google Play services, we spotted code that indicates Google Wallet might soon incorporate features that will allow users to transfer private passes between devices, or even sync them between multiple concurrent devices.",

Samsung has confirmed that it’s developing Android XR glasses in collaboration with Google, Warby Parker, and Gentle Monster.

Samsung’s Galaxy Ring hasn’t had the best press lately , but it isn’t going anywhere, and its functionality may soon expand beyond interacting with just your phone.

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops.

BlackBerry 10 may have been a failed rival to Android and iOS, but it was an intriguing and innovative mobile platform in its own right. Now, an enterprising developer has decided to build a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, and it’ll run on Android phones . Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time. Marathon OS even features the BB10 peek gesture, which …",

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US.

It replaces the older option for downloading images before sharing with the option to share pictures with public links. Whether that improves sharing or causes more friction is a matter of debate. Ever since its launch, Google’s Nano Banana has stirred up numerous viral trends for AI-generated images. And unless you’re at odds with AI and uphold that it cannot replace true art, you’re likely to have participated in some of these trends yourself. To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place. And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana. It differs from the current method, where you must either download the image first, which clutters your phone’s storage, or share it as a file by long-pressing and then tapping the Share button. While the latter allows you to share an image without first downloading it, you may encounter some compres…",

While Verizon’s rumored meeting this month may talk about employee layoffs, it’s less clear about the intentions for this meeting. The timing may just align with T-Mobile’s usual pre–holiday sales prep, discussing promotions, goals, or new initiatives like the T-Mobile credit card or T-Life rollout. Earlier this week, there were rumors that Verizon might be announcing some big changes later this month, as talks of potential layoffs are in the air. It’s still unclear if there’s any real substance to the claims, but it seems that they aren’t the only carrier with rumored changes ahead. As first reported by Visible-Bonus-9387 via Reddit , it seems T-Mobile stores around the country are set for a big meeting on November 23. According to the employee, it will be about “something big”.

The credit card may offer cashback, which can be redeemed against Samsung products, including phones. In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.

However, as is often the case in life, what’s easiest isn’t always the best, and this is especially true for smartphone apps that non-tech-savvy users might employ.

There’s a lot to like Credit: Zac Kew-Denniss / Android Authority The feature I love most in Samsung Internet is the split-view mode, along with the sidebar. Split-view puts two tabs side-by-side without having to open a new instance of the tab. The sidebar, as seen in the far right of the image, is a space where you can open a third page in a mobile UI. This has been great for researching and writing articles, as I can have my writing and two research tabs open all in one place without switching windows.",
