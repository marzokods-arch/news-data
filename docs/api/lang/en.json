    "body": "Growing up in New York City, I’ve watched footwear evolve from utility to identity. In a place where the right pair of shoes can say more than a full outfit, we’ve entered an era where craftsmanship and authenticity matter more than hype. Walk through SoHo, the LES, or even a late-night industry event in Midtown, and you’ll see it: people are gravitating toward pieces that feel personal, elevated, and built to last. That’s why Steven Victor stepping into footwear feels so natural. Known for shaping some of the most influential sounds and careers in music, he’s always operated with intention, nothing loud, nothing forced, everything rooted in quality. His debut public boot with Timberland carries that same energy. From the moment you pick it up, the difference is clear. Steven went with an ultra-soft leather that gives the boot a distinct feel. His take on the Timberland 6-inch boot is luxury without the stiffness. Quiet confidence in shoe form. For me, the classic wheat Timb is one of the first shoes I ever understood as “culture.” It’s been on construction sites, in subway stations, in music videos and in moments that shaped hip-hop history. It’s woven into the fabric of the city…",

Now 13 years later, Parker is back — and he’s still got love and romance on his mind. Released today (Nov. 14), sophomore solo set Evolution of Romance, Volume One (on Parker&#8217;s Paramount Collective Ventures label via ONErpm) is a melodious, insightful, sensual and frank 34-minute discourse on a topic that never loses its allure. “I want this project to be a conversation between men and women about affection, courtship, support, love; all the things that true romance encompasses,” Parker — the self-proclaimed “Romance Dealer” — declared ahead of the album’s release.
