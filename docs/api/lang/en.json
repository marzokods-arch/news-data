Take The Weeknd, for example. The artist born Abel Tesfaye began teasing his fans on Jan. 7, 2024, via social media. In an Instagram carousel, he shared the covers for After Hours and Dawn FM , followed by a black square with a giant white question mark in the center and a tiny parental advisory sticker in the bottom left. His caption? A single &#8220;3.&#8221; He finally revealed the title of the final album of his trilogy &#8212; Hurry Up Tomorrow &#8212; in September, and the day before Thanksgiving, shared its release date . But on Jan. 13, the musician announced that due to the deadly Los Angeles area wildfires, he was canceling his Jan. 25 Rose Bowl concert, and also delaying his album out of respect and concern for those in the impacted areas.

In a case filed Sunday in Los Angeles federal court, attorneys for a rapper named RBX (Eric Dwayne Collins) say Spotify is “all too happy” to ignore billions of fake streams per month that falsely inflate some artist stats – and that Champagne Papi was one of the most-boosted artists. “Billions of fraudulent streams have been generated with respect to songs of ‘the most streamed artist of all time,’ Aubrey Drake Graham, professionally known as Drake,” the rapper’s lawyers write. “But while the streaming fraud with respect to Drake’s songs may be one example, it does not stand alone.” Related After Udio-Universal Settlement, AI Music Lawsuits Aren&#8217;t Over: What Happens&nbsp;Now?

Shipping will begin before December 15, with prices increasing after that. The Nintendo DS was a groundbreaking console when it launched more than two decades ago, but there are vanishingly few ways to play DS games on modern hardware. ANBERNIC is here to change that with the RG DS, and it’s now available for pre-order at a surprisingly low price. With two 4-inch IPS displays and a clamshell form factor, the RG DS is roughly the same physical size as the Nintendo DSi LL, but features two additional sticks on either side of the bottom screen. The screens themselves have a resolution of 640×480, which is higher than the original consoles, but doesn’t offer perfect integer scaling. In other words, some games with pixel graphics may look a little off to the discerning eye.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices to hit the market. It also features liquid cooling, large vapor chambers, and a built-in waterproof fan. Starting at $749, global sales will begin on November 19, with early-bird vouchers and discounts available beforehand. When it comes to gaming phones , REDMAGIC has been releasing a steady stream of powerful devices that punch well above their price point, and the latest is now here to take things to the next level. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro is one of the first Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 phones to hit the market, but it has a few extra features that no phone can match. Starting with the SoC, the 8 Elite Gen 5 is the latest and greatest on the market, with our early testing indicating a 20% bump in CPU and GPU performance in reference devices for testing. We are still actively benchmarking the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, and those gains appear to hold true in this device as well. Stay tuned for our full test results and benchmarks later this week.",

Google recently announced an assembly line in India , and around mid-2025, it finally launched its own online Google Store here, complete with first-party accessories and trade-in options. Naturally, I headed straight there to pre-book a Pixel 10 , trading in my old Pixel 6a that I had lying around.

When that happens, all users will be automatically migrated to Meet, and any older history will be removed.

Anyone familiar with Google wouldn’t be surprised by this gesture — or by the period of confusion that follows, during which multiple apps with similar use cases continue to exist. So, when Duo’s time came to an end, Google set a final date to drive the nails into its coffin and announced it would take away Duo’s legacy calling features in September 2025. This was to be followed by the deletion of all older messages by November. However, it now appears that Google extended this timeline, and legacy Duo features will now sunset in January 2026.

This is because the Exynos 2500 suffered some rather notable issues. First, production yield issues and delays meant Samsung had to skip the chip entirely for the Galaxy S25 series . When it finally arrived in the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the performance was pretty lackluster; in CPU performance, it was no faster than last year’s Snapdragon rival, and there were only marginal gains in graphics.",

I ended up with several of these portable batteries to test out, and while I do appreciate their convenience, one thing stood out in all of my tests: You should really be wary of the battery’s capacity. 10,000mAh won’t be enough to charge your ~5,000mAh Pixel 10, 10 Pro, or 10 Pro XL more than once.",

    "summary": "Android almost had its own IRS that would audit apps for their battery usage. Here’s how it would’ve worked.",
    "body": "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Google restricting background work. With every new Android release, Google seemingly further restricts what apps running in the background can do. This is understandable because battery power is a finite commodity on Android phones , so allowing apps to do whatever they want whenever they want would be detrimental to battery life. To prevent rogue applications from draining your phone’s battery , the Android OS implements a number of battery management tactics to control when apps can run and how long they can run. Apps that need to perform critical, real-time tasks like downloading a file, tracking a run, or playing music can create a foreground service, but in order to do so, they must show a notification so users are aware. Instead of creating a foreground service, Google recommends most developers use APIs like JobScheduler and AlarmManager (or a higher-level wrapper, like WorkManager) to queue tasks in the background.",

The event for the original Pixel in October 2016 is still vivid in my mind — I’d never been as excited for a phone as I was in that moment, and I haven’t felt that excitement since, either. As enamored by the Pixel as I was, I stopped using Pixels for over six years, and with good reason. The Pixel 10 Pro , though, is the phone I’ve been waiting for Google to make. What went wrong If I used to be so excited about the Pixel, you may wonder when and why that stopped. Well, by the time the Pixel 3 arrived, the honeymoon period had ended. My time with the early Pixels was plagued with defective phones and issues I’d grown tired of. My Pixel XL, 2 XL, and 3 XL all had to be swapped on warranty at least three times, and the Pixel 3 XL made things worse by being a frustrating device even when it was working as intended.",

Numerous YouTube executives have given testimony that directly rebuts that claim. Now Committee on the Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin is demanding answers. The past ten months have got to be the start of one of the most embarrassing years for tech heavyweights in recent memory. One after the other, firms like Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, and of course, Google, have been prostrating themselves before a government administration they’d previously butted heads with . But in 2025, acquiescence is the name of the game, and rather than bracing for another four years of conflict, they’ve instead been kissing the ring. A few weeks back, that extended to YouTube performing a massive about-face on the necessary steps it had taken to ban some of the worst voices on its platform , spreading lies, hate, and disinformation — instead opening the door to restore their access. That move was telegraphed in late September when Alphabet legal counsel submitted a letter to the House Committee on the Judiciary, blaming COVID-era YouTube moderation policies on pressure the co…",

The 8-in-1 extender includes two app-controlled smart outlets on the front, while the four always-on outlets sit along the sides — giving you three plug-in surfaces in total. There’s also a USB-C and a USB-A port. Govee says the sockets are spaced to fit bulkier adapters without blocking each other, which is a common complaint associated with poorly designed power strips.",

That process can be wildly complex, as in the case of generative video — but on the simpler end of the spectrum, AI can be very helpful for parsing large bodies of text to create concise summaries. Google’s started putting its AI to work in the latter way on the Play Store, where you’ll soon see AI-generated summaries of aggregated user app reviews.

An increasingly popular product segment is camera lens protectors, which obviously make a lot of sense if you’ve just spent over $1,000 on one of the best camera phones on the market. While sticking a cheap layer of plastic or even glass in front of your high-precision camera might help protect it from scratches, there’s a risk that it will lower the quality of the pictures you take. Not necessarily because a protector will defocus or blur your images — something this close to the lens is unlikely to do that — but even a very transparent, high-quality protective layer will slightly reduce the amount of light reaching the sensor. In the worst case, introducing impure optics may exacerbate issues like edge aberration and lens flare, or reduce the amount of detail captured. Not what you want from a top-tier camera phone.",

The list includes several channels under ABC, ESPN, and Nat Geo labels, in addition to Disney’s. YouTube says it will refund subscribers $20 if the channels are off the network for too long. YouTube TV is already among the most expensive live digital TV services on offer in the US. And it’s about to pinch its subscribers a little more as it has failed to renew its deal with Disney. Following a public spat from last week , when YouTube accused Disney of arm-twisting it, the two parties have failed to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. With this, more than 20 channels from Disney’s network, including multiple ABC, ESPN, and National Geographic channels, have been removed from the live TV platform.",

The OnePlus 15 is peeking at us through the horizon. After launching in China this month , the phone is set to arrive globally next month with a mixed bag of upgrades and downgrades. Meanwhile, OnePlus is cooking another phone that could be all upgrades. Although it won’t arrive until next year, a leak has provided clarity about its tentative specifications. Leaker Digital Chat Station recently shared details about an upcoming small phone from OnePlus. Based on the screen size, we presume the leaker is discussing the successor to the OnePlus 13T, which launched globally as the OnePlus 13S . Therefore, it could be speculated to be called the OnePlus 15T or 15S, in line with the naming convention for the recently launched flagship.",

Earlier this year we found evidence for a new system that would store RAW images separately and not back them up. We’re now finally able to see this in action, and there’s even a toggle to opt in to backing up RAWs if you’ve got the space. If you care even a little about photography, you probably know all about RAW images . While JPGs are convenient to post and share due to their relatively small file sizes, RAW files don’t just capture an image without lots of lossy compression, but they store camera sensor data before things like white balance are corrected, giving you tons of power to control what your final output will look like, even with the photo already taken. Despite all that potential, though, they’re not without their problems, and we’ve been keeping an eye on one in particular concerning how Android handles them.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR AT&amp;T recently launched an ad campaign that uses the BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division findings to criticize T-Mobile for “un-truths.” The NAD has ordered AT&amp;T to remove the promotional material, which it says violates ad-industry rules. The carrier has now filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the self-regulatory body. You may have caught the commercial by now, where AT&amp;T uses Luke Wilson to talk about T-Mobile as a “master of breaking promises.” The commercial in question highlights the Un-Carrier’s deceptive ads and other transgressions. It’s maybe one of the most direct attacks AT&amp;T has taken against a rival in a long time. Now AT&amp;T is fighting for the right to keep its campaign up.

    "summary": "Android 17 could introduce a new “Min Mode” feature that lets apps display custom interfaces on the AOD.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a new “Min Mode” feature for the Always-On Display that will allow apps to show their own minimal, persistent interfaces. This enables richer, glanceable experiences, with Google Maps expected to be one of the first apps to use it for low-power navigation. The feature uses the same ultra-low-power display state as AOD to save battery and will likely be introduced as a new developer API in Android 17. Most Android phones have an optional feature called always-on display (AOD) that, as its name implies, keeps your phone’s screen on at all times. This feature is handy because it lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance, though it does drain some extra battery. While Android’s new Live Updates feature lets you see more from certain notifications on the AOD, they can only show so much, forcing you to pick up your phone to get the full picture. To solve this problem, Google is working on a major evolution of the AOD in Android 17 that could allow apps to fully integrate with it.

The X300 Pro is the higher-end model, offering a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto camera and a larger battery. The X300 starts at €1,049 (~$1,215), while the X300 Pro will cost €1,399 (~$1,620) This yeah, vivo is marking its 30th anniversary with two new flagships, the X300 and X300 Pro, and the highlights are simple: 200MP ZEISS imaging across the board, plus a fresh global debut for OriginOS 6. The formula here isn’t shock value; it’s a focused push on photography, performance, and long-term software support that reads like a confident year-over-year step rather than a gamble. Both phones lean hard on ZEISS hardware and tuning, but they take different routes to get there. The X300 pairs a 200MP Ultra-Sensing HPB main camera with a 50MP ZEISS APO telephoto (LYT-602) and a 50MP ultrawide (JN1). The Pro flips things for telephoto fans, using a 200MP ZEISS APO telephoto as its centerpiece, backed by a 50MP “gimbal-grade” main camera (vivo × Sony LYT-828, 1/1.28-inch) and a 50MP ultrawide.

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
