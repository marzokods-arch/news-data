Sierra Ferrell continued her reign as artist of the year, taking home her second consecutive win in that category. Ferrell becomes the first woman to win back-to-back awards for artist of the year. Brandi Carlile previously won the category twice, though not in consecutive years. Other previous back-to-back winners in the category are John Prine (2017-2018) and Billy Strings (2022-2023). Ferrell won emerging artist of the year three years ago. She&#8217;s just the second artist to go from winning emerging artist of the year to artist of the year. Sturgill Simpson was the first. Gillian Welch and David Rawlings were celebrated as duo/group of the year. The pair is the fourth collaboration to win duo/group of the year, following Alison Krauss and Robert Plant, Buddy and Julie Miller, and Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell.

A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish.

    "body": "TL;DR A new “Universal cursor” setting in Android 16 QPR2 will let users disable the seamless mouse movement between a phone and an external display. This toggle controls whether the mouse cursor can move between screens when it reaches the edge, preventing accidental screen-hopping. Found in the first QPR2 beta, this small but welcome change gives users more control over Android’s DeX-like desktop experience. One of the most exciting features in Android 16 QPR1 is its new DeX-like desktop experience, which activates when you connect a compatible Pixel device to an external display. This desktop mode provides a taskbar and freeform window management on the external monitor while leaving your phone’s screen free for other tasks. When you connect a mouse, you can seamlessly move the cursor between displays to control both screens with the same peripheral. Currently, there’s no way to disable this seamless mouse movement, but that’s set to change in the next quarterly Android release. In Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1 , there’s a new “ Universal cursor ” setting under Settings &gt; Connected devices &gt; External displays .

This marks a significant shift, as Health Connect will now be able to collect its own data directly from the phone’s sensors. This could be the first step in turning Health Connect into a comprehensive health platform, though the feature isn’t fully working yet. If you want to improve your health, there’s no shortage of services you can use to track your health, fitness, and wellness metrics. Some options are better than others at tracking certain metrics, so many people mix and match to find the best solution. To simplify this for users, Google created Health Connect in 2022 to serve as a central hub for all this data. Currently, the service only facilitates data sharing between different health and fitness apps and doesn’t track any data on its own. That’s set to change, though, as Google is working on adding native step tracking support to Health Connect.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 series comes with a toggle to turn off PWM dimming, a method that lowers the display’s brightness by strobing it in short intervals. PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced. All iPhone 17 models reportedly come with a hidden setting to toggle PWM (pulse-width modulation) on or off. The setting is supposedly buried among Accessibility options in iOS 26 release cand…",

A Telegram user alerted us about the feature, and we confirmed it’s working on our Pixel 9. Last year, Gemini introduced a split-screen shortcut for large-screen Android devices such as foldables and tablets. The feature worked on Samsung devices, the Pixel Tablet, and the Pixel Fold. Now, Google appears to be bringing this capability to traditional “bar” phones as well. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority AT&amp;T takes a different approach than Verizon and T-Mobile when it comes to promotions, upgrades, and special deals. While its rivals often advertise free phones with no trade-in required, AT&amp;T rarely offers devices entirely free up front. That can make it less appealing to switchers, but the trade-off is that existing customers typically get the same deals as new ones. The main caveat is that upgrade offers usually require a higher-end plan, whereas new customers can often qualify with even a base unlimited plan. This applies to every deal listed below, unless otherwise noted.",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new space in the Gemini app to store all media generated with it. The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library.

The Absolute Black and Mist Purple SKUs will reportedly weigh 215g, while the Dune color is a little lighter at 211g. Back in June, a leak claimed that the next flagship from OnePlus would have a “SuperBlack” colorway . This black color reportedly has a very high light absorption rate, high enough that “the body looks like a black hole.” But what will this color be called? And while on that topic, what other colors will be available on the OnePlus 15? A new leak may have shed some light on those questions. The leak about the “SuperBlack” color came from trusted tipster Digital Chat Station, who is back with another color-related leak. This time, the Weibo user has revealed what could be the official color names for the OnePlus 15. Additionally, they shared how much each SKU could weigh.",

Samsung’s been a leader there, claiming 2,000 cycles for devices like its Galaxy S25 phones. Apple only manages to hit 1,000 cycles, according to its iPhone 17 energy labels. Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles. But how does that compare to the new iPhone 17 family?",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Users are reporting that there’s an issue with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. It appears that the screws that hold the ring to the magnetic panel are becoming loose. One of the more exciting aspects of the Pixel 10’s launch was the announcement of the new Pixelsnap accessories . These MagSafe-like items can magnetically snap onto the Pixel 10 without the need for a special case. Now that the Pixel 10 has been out for a couple of weeks, plenty of owners have had the opportunity to use these products. Although they have only been available for a short amount of time, it appears one Pixelsnap accessory is already running into issues. Spotted by 9to5Google , multiple reports are coming in through Reddit about a problem with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand. According to the reports, the issue deals with the screws near the hinge, which keep the metal ring attached to the magnetic panel and provide the resistance to prop the Pixel 10 up. These users claim that the screws are becoming undone.",

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

We’ve seen some epic failures over the years, like the disaster that was the Fire Phone, and while its Echo smart speakers have been market leaders, it’s still very unclear if Alexa Plus is going to give all those smart home devices the boost they need to remain competitive. Today we’re hearing about some ambitious plans to expand its hardware lineup, with a report outlining the company’s goals for two new AR solutions. Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects. Last year, we heard that Amazon could be building an AR pair of its own , though one that would be focused on assisting its delivery drivers.

These fuels must be kept at ultra-low cryogenic temperatures to remain in liquid form; however, solar heating and other sources of heat increase the rate of evaporation of the liquid and cause the pressure in the storage tank to increase. Current storage methods require venting the cryogenic propellant to space to control the pressure in fuel tanks.

The shrimp and crackers are held in place by condiments, while the sushi stays put thanks to surface tension from its moisture. Activity aboard the space station will inform long-duration missions like Artemis and future human expeditions to Mars. Image credit: NASA/Jonny Kim",

A referral code provides a 10% discount on a new Pixel phone for the buyer and gives the referrer a $50 store credit. The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

    "summary": "Instead of dragging and dropping tiles in the Quick Settings panel, you can double tap to quickly reposition them.",
    "body": "TL;DR A hidden feature in Android 16 QPR1 offers a new, faster way to reorganize your Quick Settings tiles. Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

On paper, it sounded like the perfect addition to Samsung’s array of smart features. But when Now Brief actually rolled out, and I witnessed it in action, it quickly became clear that it wasn’t living up to Samsung’s promises or the expectations of its users.",

Preorders are available now for $159, with global availability beginning September 23, 2025 Reddit users spotted it weeks ago , but now it’s official: Kobo is adding a white version of its fan-favorite Clara Colour e-reader. The launch doesn’t change any internals, but it does give shoppers a fresh option heading into the holiday season. The Kobo Clara Colour first debuted last year in black, alongside the larger Kobo Libra Colour . Both introduced E Ink Kaleido 3 screens to Kobo’s lineup, letting readers highlight text in multiple hues and adding subtle color to comics and illustrated titles. However, only the Libra was available in a white and black build, while the Clara was limited to black. For months, shoppers have been vocal about wanting to see the smaller device in a white variant like its sibling. In a classic case of ask and you shall receive, Kobo has delivered the requested makeover and now offers a white model to those looking for a brighter aesthetic on their nightstand.",

Spotify and YouTube Music are reasonably competitive in their features , with each service having some nice extras. Spotify Connect is a lifesaver if you have multiple devices, whereas YouTube Music being bundled in YouTube Premium works out in its favor. Both services have been trying to convert more of their free users into becoming paid customers, and now it seems YouTube Music is borrowing a leaf out of Spotify’s book by paywalling the lyrics feature.

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

The AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini is an entry-level device with a very compact form factor. It looks very much like its older sibling, the Pocket AIR, which launched back in 2023. As the company’s first Android-based device, it helped set the scene for the rest of its lineup, and now the highly sought-after handheld has been scrunched down and reduced in price.",
