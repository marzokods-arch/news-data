    "body": "TL;DR Starting next year, Android will block the installation of apps from unverified developers, a policy that affects both Play Store and sideloaded apps. The new system requires Android to check if a developer is verified, which in some cases will necessitate an active internet connection during installation. Hobbyist developers can get a free account but will face strict distribution limits, requiring them to manually authorize each device installing their app. Back in August, Google made an announcement that shocked Android enthusiasts and privacy advocates: Starting next year, Android will block the installation of apps from unverified developers . This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay. The company also shared new details about how its developer verification requirements will be enforced, including that, in some cases, Android will require an active network connection to sideload apps. Last month, we spotted evidence in the Android SDK suggesting develop…",

On some airlines, you’ll no longer be able to use or charge any kind of power bank while in the cabin. The rule change is in response to the growing number of power bank incidents. The thought of being stuck on a flight with nothing to keep you entertained is a nightmare. That’s why many travelers tend to bring power banks with them, so their devices stay juiced up as they move from point A to point B. But the next time you plan a trip, be sure to check the rules on power banks for your flight, as some airlines are becoming stricter about these charging devices.

Early this year, we shared evidence that the Google Calendar app was cooking up new sharing controls , a change that would save users having to use the desktop interface to share calendars with others, as well as to unsubscribe from calendars you no longer want to see. Those changes are now rolling out widely. As of version 2025.38.0-809757839-release of Google Calendar, the app presents options to share individual calendars with other users or groups, right from your phone. The option isn’t terribly obvious, nested under Settings in Google Calendar’s side panel menu. But considering these actions weren’t possible in the app at all up until now, it’s definitely an improvement.",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

It depends what he’s thinking. I really don’t care. Like, whatever he’s said, then I’m that, fine. Not really. But that’s a rap lyric.” Earlier this summer, music producer Damion “Damizza” Young — who began working with Carey in the late 1980s — claimed on the TFU podcast that he introduced Eminem to the pop superstar.

His early work with Dillard &amp; Clark and on the Burrito Brothers&#8217; second and third albums fused traditional instrumentation with progressive songwriting, laying the foundation for what would later be dubbed Americana. In 1971, he co-founded the Eagles with Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Randy Meisner, helping craft the band&#8217;s signature sound meshing country and rock. His contributions — on guitar, banjo, pedal steel and mandolin — defined early Eagles albums such as the band&#8217;s self-titled debut, Desperado and One of These Nights .

The leak corroborates the feature activates automatically in crowded spaces. It also suggests users will have the option to choose which aspects to restrict and which ones to allow. The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well.

Between the long-awaited Gemini rollout , redesigned Home app , new Nest cameras , and really impressive Ask Home capabilities , Google’s smart home ambitions have never looked brighter. However, for everything Google seems to have gotten right with this next chapter of Google Home, there’s one area that still feels noticeably lacking: hardware.

Google recently mentioned that it will no longer offer its Weather app for new installations on Wear OS 6 and newer smartwatches. The company went so far as to encourage users to use either third-party weather apps or the default weather apps offered by watch brands. Pixel Watch owners might think they are in a bit of a pickle, but they’re not, as Google has been spotted working on a Pixel Weather app for Wear OS , complete with Material 3 Expressive design changes.

Samsung’s rollout of One UI 8 is catching up in pace. While it is much more timely compared to its laggard One UI 7 rollout, it feels like a mere version upgrade with few changes. However, to ensure we have no complaints, it is also working on a significant update with One UI 8.5, which is expected to arrive with the Galaxy S26 series in the coming months. We’ve already spotted nearly a dozen new features in One UI 8.5 and are learning about a quite useful addition. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could introduce partial screen recording, which would allow only a selected portion of the display to be captured and displayed in the video. The feature was spotted in a leaked One UI 8.5 test build and reported by leaker Ice Universe on Weibo .",

The features will launch on Kindle iOS later in 2025 and on Kindle devices in early 2026. True to trend, the Kindle platform is getting another dose of generative AI. Alongside the newest Kindle Scribe lineup launched at its fall hardware event, Amazon announced two new reading tools: Story So Far and Ask This Book. Both aim to make reading more interactive while sparing users from spoilers. Story So Far acts like a spoiler-safe highlight reel. Instead of flipping back through a book, readers will be able to pull up a clean summary of everything that’s happened up to the page they’re on. The tool should make it easier to jump back into abandoned titles or long storylines. Ask This Book, on the other hand, adds a conversational layer to the Kindle experience. The tool will allow users to highlight passages and ask context-aware questions, such as “What’s the significance of this scene?” Amazon says the system will answer based only on the text read so far, helping with comprehension without spoiling future plot poin…",

Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of. But are you sure you can trust that data? Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Last month, this stopped working, and Gemini will only create new pictures that are square. Google says that it’s working on a fix, and there are some workaround you can use until then. If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place.

The deal applies to the Visible Plus Pro plan, which offers premium features such as unlimited 5G UW data, hotspot use, smartwatch service, and international perks. This limited-time offer is available until November 3 and includes taxes and fees in the monthly price. Visible is likely the prepaid service I recommend the most to those looking for a low-cost alternative to postpaid without noticeably sacrificing network performance, and that’s especially true for its Visible Plus and Visible Plus Pro plans. While the most expensive of these options typically runs for $45 a month (taxes and fees included), what if you could get six months of service for just $22.50 a month ?

Maybe as a consequence of us reaching that smart home plateau, new hardware from Google has been few and far between. Probably the biggest motion we’ve had in years was the introduction of the Pixel Tablet back in 2023, so I was understandably excited during the Pixel 10 launch when Google appeared to tease the release of a then-unknown new Nest speaker .",

The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone.

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s newly introduced Gemini features in the new Google Home app will require a separate subscription. Home Premium plans start at $10 a month and will include features such as Ask Home, Gemini Live with Nest speakers, and Home Brief. However, if you already pay for a Gemini subscription, these perks can be availed without an additional subscription. Google just released a suite of new Home devices with Gemini, replacing Google Assistant on yet another platform. As part of its announcement, Google has also announced new features that will enrich how you use and interact with myriad smart devices compatible with the Google Home app . With Gemini’s integration , the Google Home app on Android is getting a conversational interface. As with other Gemini applications, the idea is to make chores feel more effortless. For instance, you can ask about specific events captured by various outdoor or indoor cameras. In such an event, it should find relevant clips in a matter of seconds, thereby eliminating the need for manual scrubbing. These are part of a new feature called “Ask Home.”",

The phone could join the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra, making it a quartet of devices. The decision was apparently made due to lower-than-expected Galaxy S25 Edge sales. We’ve heard rumors for a while now that Samsung could replace the Galaxy S26 Plus with the Galaxy S26 Edge. In fact, we’ve even uncovered evidence of this back in July. However, it sounds like Samsung will bring back the Galaxy S26 Plus after all. Korean outlet The Elec (spotted via Jukanlosreve on X) reports that Samsung has begun development on a Galaxy S26 series phone with the project name M Plus. This suggests that we’re looking at a Galaxy S26 Plus. For what it’s worth, the previously revealed M1, M2, and M3 project names refer to the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra , respectively.",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Samsung reimbursed him for travel costs, collected the device, and is conducting an investigation. The user pointed to other online battery complaints, including one case of swelling. The Galaxy Ring made headlines yesterday after a tech creator reported that the battery inside his unit swelled while it was on his finger . He ended up missing a flight and required hospital assistance to have the device removed. Samsung later told Android Authority it was an “extremely rare” case. The user himself suggested that saltwater exposure might have been a factor, which we speculated could make sense given that the ring’s IP68 rating doesn’t stretch as far as protection against saltwater.

Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.

Much of the skepticism is driven by a fear of product abandonment, poor software performance, or Gemini making basic controls worse. Some commenters remain hopeful about the platform’s future. It’s always a risk to bet on a comeback. When one of my colleagues recently explained why he was willing to give the Google Home ecosystem another shot, he admitted he might be foolish for doing so. While he’s ready to take the gamble on the next generation of Gemini-powered devices , it seems the majority of our readers aren’t. After years of glitches and abandoned products, many users are suggesting they’ve been burned by Google one too many times to trust the company with their smart home gear. The general sentiment left in the comments section of Joe Maring’s article is a vote of no confidence in the platform’s future. The original piece argued that new hardware, a redesigned Home app, and the integration of Gemini could finally put Google’s smart home back on track. However, the comments reve…",

Unfortunately, if you’ve spent any time trying to charge all these gadgets optimally with even the best third-party adapters , you’ll doubtless be aware of the labyrinth of charging standards and protocols that must be navigated to have everything play nicely together. At the heart of modern charging is USB Power Delivery (USB PD), the USB Implementers Forum’s official fast charging standard that can supply more power than a USB-C port’s basic capabilities.
