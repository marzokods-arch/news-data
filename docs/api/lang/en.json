The Echo Aviation Controller is specifically geared towards playing flight simulators on PC, and is already readying for a mid-December 2025 takeoff. Rather than saddling yourself with heaps of specialist hardware, this pad attempts to, according to the press release, “cram a cockpit into a controller.” Perhaps a gift idea for the geek in your life that got really into Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ? I mean, all that functionality scrunched up into a gamepad footprint does make the Echo Aviation Controller look like an arcane instrument. However, all those improbably placed knobs and dials allow players to simultaneously control the “pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, trim and core aircraft systems.” Talk about a packed flight.

In the most recent update, which brings it to version 1.4, the sun vacuum from the console versions finally arrives on PC—as do more hotkeys, bug fixes, and Remote Play Together. I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice. This latest update also gets rid of \"incorrect placeholder assets\" in the almanac, which players claimed had been AI-upscaled , and makes the gu…",

For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins. Like all of Darktide's player-characters the Hive Scum gets plenty of cosmetic options, with full-body tattoos and punk hairstyles, and they're the only class to have access to face paints so far.

You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype.

Amid scattered complaints of bugginess, a shortened campaign, and connection issues with its co-op mode, one user summed it up with the most damning sort of praise a game can get: \"Anno is fine.\" Most of the negative reviews are focused on how unhappy players are that AI assets have been used in the game.

Nobody thinks the lady with the big deadly sword is a healer, but they also can't figure out if she's going to be a tank or a damage-dealer. Usually, Blizzard makes it pretty clear how a character will play in the game, even if their reveal cinematic is mostly focused on their backstory and isn't captured in-game. Vendetta's video is a tricky case because we see her cut apart a robot—pretty damaging by any measure—but also block its shots with her gigantic sword almost like a tank would. That's not unprecedented: Overwatch already has tank heroes, like Junker Queen, who could easily be mistaken for damage-dealers because they don't carry around a big shield like Reinhardt. It doesn't help that Blizzard hasn't clarified what role Vendetta will be in the video's description or on social media, leaving it to fans to try to suss out the answer. But here's the thing: Blizzard, or at least a PR agency representing it, already confirmed Vendetta's role in an email to press right after the trailer went out. PC Gamer, along w…",

But the Apple Macintosh Classic 2 did boot just fine, which is what makes the pay-off of this blog from programmer Doug Brown so great. Through an intense, labyrinthine series of tests using both software and hardware, Brown discovered that the final all-in-one Mac to use a black & white screen shipped with a bug that would have disastrously crashed the computer every single time you turned it on—if not for a miraculous, unknown feature of its Motorola 68030 CPU that hid the problem from Apple's programmers.

Opting out of big clans on official servers has never been the easiest way to play Rust, but recent monument, scrap, and blueprint reworks have turned the island into a real bloodbath—moreso than usual. Historically, scrap has been pretty easy to get, and its abundance throughout the map made crafting upgraded workbenches easy. Playing it safe and farming scrap around your base meant fewer people out in the world for PvP, but the strategy worked. As a solo player, I could visit monuments to find a little treat, but I didn't need to venture into the wild as soon as possible. The update largely reduces scrap cost, but tacks on a new material requirement with two types of Blueprint Fragments. You can get lucky and find some of them, but monuments have guaranteed drops in special puzzle rooms.

Ouch. Honest mistake, though, and to Valve's credit it offered developer Permadeath a small makeup: an opportunity to spotlight Planet Centauri as one of Steam's Daily Deals, \"as a way to help make up for lost visibility.\" The studio has since moved on to other things, because there really wasn't any choice in the matter, but despite some misgivings it did eventually decide to take Valve up on the offer. So, as reported by Polygon , a little over a month ago Permadeath signed up for the Daily Deal spotlight on one of the dates offered by Valve: November 12. November 12, as it turned out, was a very big day—but not for Planet Centauri. Because November 12 was the day Valve revealed the Steam Machine , Steam Frame , and Steam Controller to the world, a move that completely dominated the videogaming news scene for days and b…",

Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines.

And by \"a bunch of YouTubers,\" they mostly meant VaatiVidya, the YouTuber everyone goes to for FromSoftware lore explanations. He's been doing it since Dark Souls and still isn't finished picking apart Elden Ring. And he'll be taking this cycle to its next step with a book that includes all the scripts he's written over the past three years. Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained will include the text from 20 hours of video crammed into a gigantic tome full of original art—some of which you've seen in Vaati's most popular videos . It's not licensed, but it's probably as close as you're going to get when it comes to a breakdown of the Elden Ring story. \"This book will bind together everything I've learned from Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, and Nightreign into one single volume,\" Vaati says in a post on YouTube. \"My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made t…",

When Cain says old games, he means old games. We're not talking about his work on the first Fallout here, which is already more than a quarter of a century old. Instead, Cain said we should hearken back to games from the '80s, when he started working in the games industry as a teen. Computer hardware in the '80s was, obviously, less capable. And crucially, Cain said, there were no shared hardware and software standards, even as \"games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles.\" Game…",

It's reached the point where even developer Larian Studios seems a little baffled by the whole thing. A quick recap: Baldur's Gate 3 ran the board on Game of the Year Awards in 2023, taking the big crown (and numerous other laurels) in the Steam Awards, The Game Awards, and the Golden Joysticks. It then continued to rumble in 2024, taking five trophies including Best Game and the Player's Choice awards at the 2024 BAFTAs and four more—including, again, Game of the Year—at the Gayming Awards. It got to the point where Larian boss Swen Vincke was almost asking the world to please stop giving us awards , because the seemingly endless stream of accolades meant the development team \"can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.\" And then a month after that Baldur's Gate 3 won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work, because sure, why not.

Recognising the asset, McFarlane took to social media to address the issue: \"Hey Delta Force, thank you for being huge Rust fans. Please remove our assets,\" McFarlane posted on X (via Insider Gaming ). \"If you wanted to collab, you should have reached out.\" In a follow-up post, McFarlane linked to an ArtStation page showing the asset, which he says was made \"fully in-house\" by Facepunch's lead weapon and prop artist Thomas Butters, who also goes by Pilgrim. It looks virtually identical to the asset seen in the trailer, though this doesn't necessarily mean it is the same asset.

As part of the project, participants Terrence and Lesley Bridges replaced their gas boiler with the mini data centre in question and claim their bills have dropped from £375 a month (almost $500) to only £40 a month (about $50). The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause.

So far, we haven't seen any dramatic increases in PC system prices, but as Black Friday 2025 hoves into view, the question is for how much longer will that remain the case? Trendforce recently downgraded its expectations for 2025 from 1.7% growth for the overall PC market to -2.4% shrinkage. For smartphones, Trendforce revised its figures from 0.1% down to -2%. According to Hankyung, memory accounts for 25% of the cost of AI PCs and 18% of the cost of smartphones. Trendforce reportedly expects laptop prices to rise by five to 15% on account of the 75% increase in RAM module prices that we've already seen. Presumably if memory prices go yet higher, retail system prices will follow. Hankyung also notes that the price of 16 Gb DDR5 chips more than doubled to $24.80 per unit in the month to November 18 on DRAMeXchange . In response, bigger players in the IT industry including Asus and Apple are said to be preemptively purchasing DRAM (and also NAND memory for SSDs), while also discontinuing low-margin products.…",

This was revealed in a Bluesky post by Inkle's narrative director and writer Jon Ingold, where he stated that \"Heaven's Vault started out as a Doctor Who game\".

The case doesn't make a good first impression, in large part thanks to the bag of loose screws hanging in the rear.

And one of them was Bobby Kotick. Chatting on the Rushmore podcast , host Ari Emanuel, CEO of Endeavor, asked the former Activision CEO if he'd played Minecraft (cheers TWIV ). \"Yeah, I almost bought it,\" Kotick replied. \"I had to spend five days in Stockholm with Notch, the guy who founded the company, and then we offered him $1.5 billion.\" But then Kotick discovered that, while he'd be getting the company and Minecraft, he wouldn't be getting Notch or the leadership team. \"He said, ''Oh, by the way, I'm quitting, and my top leadership guys are all quitting.' And they only had 30 employees at the company.\" Kotick didn't want to have to take the reins. \"We can't run your company,\" he told Notch. Not that it mattered, since Microsoft swooped in shortly after. \"And then he called me and he said 'Microsoft offered me $2.5 billion for the company.'

Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this.

If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures.

That doesn't seem like anything special these days, but the Pathfinder's party t…",

When asked how the AI bubble bursting would affect Google Pichai tells the BBC the company would survive, but also that \"no company is going to be immune, including us.\" In an interview with the British news organisation Google's Sundar Pichai talks at length about this technology as we enter \"clearly the era of AI.\" Pichai has been the CEO of Google for over a decade now, and as such, he is one of the most influential voices in favour of the rise of generative AI tools. Google, alongside all its competitors, is committing a lot of time, money, and effort into the growth of AI. Pichai says, \"AI is dramatically increasing demand for energy\", adding that \"maybe four years ago, Google was spending less than 30 billion dollars per year. This year, that number is going to be over 90 billion dollars.\" With exponential growth comes the potential of that growth stopping suddenly, and the industries built around it collapsing in response.

On that front, Valve explains that the company's upcoming machine is actually \"equal or better\" than 70% of Steam gamers' systems. Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home. So that's also another way to, kind of, think about where we kind of arrived at that performance level [that they targeted]\" (via Notebookcheck ).

Navok reckons that, for as much as people like me bang on about AI being the labour-sucking death of art, \"it appears consumers generally do not care\" when the tech manifests in their games. To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.
