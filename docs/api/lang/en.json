But unlike your usual old-school music discovery methods—the radio, bargain bin CDs, listening to your pal's MP3 player—the way I stumbled across what is now one of my favourite bands is a little strange. I actually first heard Hayley Williams warbling in The Sims' nonsense language, Simlish. It first made an appearance in the console version of The Sims 2, and I was hooked from the very first radio play. It took me some time to realise that Pressure and Paramore was a real song performed by a real artist—listen, I was a child, and a bit of a stupid one at that—but Simlish renditions of real-world songs have since become an integral part of The Sims experience. Sure, you could probably just add the songs in English and be done with it, but The Sims intentionally avoided using real languages in the game for a reason. S…",

But I doubt you'll need a cagoule and a thermos when exploring The Northern Beaches of Titan Quest 2 . This windswept coastline serves as the primary setting for the mythological ARPG's second chapter , bringing you one step closer in your showdown to face the goddess of retribution, Nemesis. The Northern Beaches brings a host of new quests for you to embark upon, as well as nine new dungeons, three titanic boss fights, and absolutely shedloads of rock (of the mineral kind, not the Blackpool kind ). Alongside the bosses, the stony shores are prowled by new Ichthian creatures to fight, such as the Ketos Spawn and \"shark-like Bruisers\" led by powerful commanders. The second chapter also unlocks the fourth tier of the ARPG's masteries (Titan Quest 2's word for skill-trees). These will let you experiment with seven extra active skills—such as…",

Slavic Magic's medieval city-builder was the most exciting thing to happen in April 2024, a quietly enthralling simulation of everyday life in the Middle Ages that somehow achieved cultural critical mass, becoming Steam's most wishlisted game and selling 3 million copies in its first year of early access. Yet while updates remained relatively consistent through last year, 2025 has been much more sporadic, with no updates in the last nine months. That's changed now, however, as Slavic Magic has finally released a new experimental beta for Manor Lords, one that brings an impressive array of new features to the city-builder. The beta patch expands the scope of Manor Lords in several directions. It adds four new maps that can be played in two additional game modes—1v1 Duel and a four-way free-for-all called Fractured Realm. It also adds a new masonry-themed production chain that lets players fashion stone and mortar through building a quarry, stonemason and lime kiln. Meanwhile, many existing mechanics and ideas have been expanded or reworked. Castle-building is mor…",

Sure, it would have sold far fewer copies with such a title, but at least it would have been correct . Now, though, it won't be long until 3D Realms' 1996 shooter fully embraces length, breadth and depth, thanks to one intrepid modder utterly obsessed with voxels. Said modder is Dan Peterson , who goes by the monicker Cheello, a game developer specialising in voxel tech who spends his spare time bulking out classic 90s shooters using the pixel's three-dimensional equivalent. Peterson's first project was Blood: Coagulated , which replaces the enemies and objects of Monolith's 1997 shooter with fatter, voxel-based versions. But Peterson is best known for his 2022 mod Voxel Doom , which brought us chunky pinkies, beefier hellknights, and truly round Cacodemons. Now, Peterson has revealed Voxel Duke Nukem 3D, debuting the project in a trailer on YouTube. \"All monsters, babes, props and more have been fully converted to 3D voxel models.\" Peterson writes in the trailer description. \"Blast your way th…",

There was a base-building update in June of this year, with a bunch of improvements, adjustments, and optimization to the base-building mechanics, and now there's been another update out of the blue , adding controller support and Steam Deck verification. The menus for building and accessing your inventory have all been revised to be more controller-friendly, text size tweaked for the Steam Deck version, in-game keyboards added, and the sled's input system \"adjusted to better support joystick input.\" Basically, it should play fine with your thumbs on the sticks rather than your hands on a mouse and keyboard.

Microsoft says it is growing and popular, but Xbox has been on a steady drumbeat of mass layoffs and studio closures in recent years. One of the employees speaking to Bloomberg cited the $300 million figure as an internal estimate. I've seen some skepticism about the figure, and a comparison to how publishers count every pirate download of a game as a missed sale when prosecuting pirates or commenting publicly on piracy's impact, but I don't think that quite maps on to what's going on here.

Roblox did not give a firm list of these \"sensitive issues,\" saying vaguely that they include \"any current sensitive social, political, or religious issue\" with \"polarized viewpoints\" or a potential to trigger a \"strong emotional response.\" The announcement on the new policy gave some examples, stating that \"issues such as immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, prayer in schools, racial profiling, affirmative action, vaccination policies, and reproductive righ…",

What is clear is that GameStop is listening to the complaints about the price hike. In contrast, Microsoft is reportedly attempting to smooth things over by considering a free, ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming . Gamers canceled their Game Pass subscriptions in droves when the price increases were announced earlier this week, the most egregious of which was the new $29.99 per month rate for Game Pass Ultimate.

I am of course referring to the other Wheel of Time , the first-person spell-slinger developed by Legend Entertainment and released in 1999. The Wheel of Time was praised by critics when it launched, partly due to its association with the popular series of fantasy novels, but equally due to its decent singleplayer campaign and innovative multiplayer mode. Despite this, it sold poorly, fading quickly amid the torrent of first-person shooters that rushed across shelves in the late nineties.

Instead, we were eating the seed corn and they were taking all the money.\" West and Zampella sued Activision for wrongful termination; Activision countersued, alleging the pair were \"small-minded executives\" motivated by \"envy and personal greed\". (Image credit: Activision) Ultimately, the publisher settled with West and Zampella ahead of a trial. But the damage was done. Many of Infinity Ward's veterans had followed their bosses to Respawn, a new EA-funded outfit that would go on to make Titanfall, Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Close your eyes, shut off your brain and picture yourself kicking back on the white sands of Vice beach this May, sunkissed, fancy free and packing more heat than a chilli cook off. OK, now open your eyes, snap back to reality and get excited for a different crime simulator, one that pays homage to the long road that paved the way for Rockstar's next blockbuster outing with a splash of Hotline Miami for extra flavour. You don't need me to tell you that's one hell of a sell, and it's exactly what The Henchmen promises—a retro-inspired, top-down sandbox shooter that's coming soon to Steam, whose chaotic cops-and-robbers set pieces nod to GTA 2, with claustrophobic quick-fire combat that echoes Dennaton's ultra-violent smash hit. Here's a trailer: Set in the fictional borough of New Queens, The Henchmen unfolds over six years, across a \"snow-covered\" 1990 and a \"sun-bleached\" 1996. In doing so, the timeline charts the protagonist's rise through the city's criminal ranks in their bid to rule the seedy underbelly of New Queens, on a journey that can be undertaken on y…",

Lordbound transports Skyrim adventurers to the all-new valley of Druadach, a wartorn region that has recently reestablished its connection to the provinces of Skyrim and High Rock. The mod sees you embroiled in a conflict between the Imperial Legion and a band of Orcs holed up in a mountain fortress, one that just so happens to be smack in the middle of a trade route between High Rock's capital Jehanna and Skyrim's largest city, Solitude. The mod mainly adds what you'd expect from a fan-made expansion.

It also adds the ability to cast signs, and even incorporates Geralt-style fisticuffs just in case you're caught without your weapon drawn. Chiefly, the mod replaces Milady and Leda's swords with blades of steel and silver, typically wielded by Witchers, both of which can be purchased from Merchant Kalé in Limgrave.

To fix the issue, Firaxis says it has \"started from scratch and created a new base algorithm for making maps\" in Civ, while simultaneously introducing two extra map types. \"Continents and Islands\" serves as the new map default for single-player, mixing up larger and smaller landmasses of various sizes, while \"Pangaea and Islands\" situates the bulk of the action on one giant geographical inkblot, with splashes of separate terrain in and around it.

One market analyst reckons this tomfoolery has gone far enough, these companies and those who invest in them are about to hit \"diminishing returns hard\", and is telling their clients to steer well clear. Let's put the argument for AI as briefly as possible: It's going to change the world on a scale that is currently so unimaginable it could only be described as revolutionary. It will transform industries and economies. And it is only fair to say that AI technologies have achieved some remarkable things that may point in this direction, particularly in the field of medicine. But that's the thing.

Black Ops 7 perks function much like they did in last year's Black Ops 6: Pick three from a huge pool of bonuses, either ignoring or targeting a \"combat speciality\" bonus for using perks of the same type. The big change to perks this year is the addition of hybrid specialities, alternative bonuses to the three main combat specialities that let you mix and match perk types a bit. There are also more perks at launch than last year (27 vs 21) and some existing ones have moved around tiers, but if you got comfortable with perk combinations in Blops 6, most of them will still work the same in Blops 7. There are three perk types: Offense (red), Stealth (Blue), and Support (Green). In Blops 6, these categories were called Enforcer, Recon, and Strategist to match their associated combat specialties, but now that hybrid specialities are a thing, they were given generic names.

Megabonk almost didn't look real at first: Its aesthetic is like some kind of 3D asset nightmare where skeletons pop into Mario coins and a fox wizard shoots fireballs at Piggsy from Manhunt. It's a crude mixture of pixel art and chunky 3D models that wouldn't look out of place on a TV in the background of an episode of NCIS.

Why is Helldivers 2 roughly 150GB on PC, and around a third that size on consoles? Armstrong says it's all down to a proportion of the PC playerbase who still have hard disk drives (HDD) rather than solid-state drives (SSD). His full explanation follows but, essentially, Arrowhead duplicates a tonne of information in order to make the game load faster for those on HDDs (which matters because no match starts until all players have loaded the mission, regardless of hardware). \"An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data,\" says Armstrong ( thanks, VGC ). \"The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. \"To solve this problem, we deliberately duplicate certain data files (like a common tree texture or a sound effect) and place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.

This was partially unveiled just a few weeks ago , but we've now got a few bold claims on the pipeline of creation in the engine, plus a link to sign up for the beta. In a blog post titled \" Meta Horizon Engine at a glance \", Meta says the new engine focuses on a few major points: The first is 'Scalability from cloud to mobile', which is effectively the ability to run worlds on the cloud, and then on mobile devices. It mentions the idea of \"running on mobile phones\", which suggests you will be able to play worlds natively, which you couldn't do prior. The second is \"speed and performance\". Meta claims worlds \"load and run quickly\" with its new engine. The third is \"familiar tools\", and it says Horizon Engine will work with templates and formats that are designed to be familiar to developers. Given that Horizon Worlds are user-made, this could speed up production and lower the skill ceiling. The last element is \"platform evolution\". Effectively, Meta argu…",

It's compatible with any GPU using the modern 16-pin connector, ie most of the RTX 40- and 50-series cards. It works by monitoring the current and voltage being delivered to a graphics card, though unlike other devices that do much the same thing, it actively distributes load across the connector to ensure no single pin is overloaded. If you think back to the initial testing of the 12VHPWR connector, which was redesigned with the 12V-2X6 standard due to failure rates, it was shown that the power load was not being distributed evenly across the entire connector. This, in some cases, leading to single pins on the connector melting due to overheating. The Ampinel prevents such an issue occuring.

Specifically, the study investigated the process of lithium-ion intercalation , the electrochemical schenanigans that take place in the batteries we use in watches, phones, and pretty much anything these days. When you charge up the batteries in such devices, lithium ions are driven from an electrolytic solution and jammed into a solid electrode by a voltage source. This process has been intensively studied over the years, and battery designers have typically resorted to using the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation to predict the behaviour of lithium-ion cells. However, the BV formula is…",

The incredible strength didn't lie in cancelling it—I can live without free delivery on my pantaloons and draining racks and whatever else it was I bought on there—but in remembering I had it in the first place. Well, maybe now I regret that, because Big Jeff Bezos is taking some time away from making the Washington Post worse to dole out some very good games this October via Prime Gaming . Who says the capitalist class never does anything for you? You can find the full list below, but the big-ticket items here as far as I'm concerned are Fallout: New Vegas (either the best or second-best Fallout game, depending on what day you catch me) and Fallout 3 (slightly worse than Fallout 4; come at me). The former will be available on October 16, the latter on October 23. I suspect the timing here might just be deliberate: the very good Fallout TV show, brought to you by Amazon, is set to hit on December 17 this year, and Lucy and the gang are set to head to New Vegas itself. A great time, then, to catch up on the lore of the game. And then also to play Fallout 3, I guess. Both Fallout…",
