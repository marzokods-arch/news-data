While I'm up close and he's staggered I switch to shotgun to finish him off, then jetpack away. There's a bunch more robot enemies in this arena, and I saw some ammo up on the wallrun I could reach while I wait for the core-yanking ability to come back online. This is a fairly typical five seconds of Metal Eden, a superspeed neon FPS where you're a parkour android with a big bag of tools for movement and for destruction. There's a grappling hook and double-jump, a freezy grenade, and a morph ball mode right out of Super Metroid that lets you roll around flinging homing missiles and lightning. (Image credit: Deep Silver) Staggering enemies with a punch before finishing them off guarantees they'll drop health, while throwing a core at them ensures they'll drop ammo.

Clawing your way to a boss in Silksong is merely step one of the trial that awaits you when you inevitably die. Instead of showing you mercy and letting you respawn a few steps away from the fight, it drops you in a different zip code. What could be a short jog back to the boss is actually an obstacle course of spikes, falling rocks, and flies equipped with sniper rifles. Silksong will kill you with bosses who wipe out half of your health bar with a sneeze and then laugh as you trip and fall on the way back. It's so brutal that even fans of the original Hollow Knight, which has its fair share of rough runbacks, can't believe how bad it is from the start . It doesn't help that it takes Silksong all of 20 minutes before it starts throwing out enemies and environmental hazards …",

A month ahead of launch, we have our first acknowledgement from DICE that vehicle balance needs work via lead producer David Sirland. The exchange began with a video of leaked Operation Firestorm gameplay depicting an engineer sniping and firing rockets from the map's highest tower. To critics of Battlefield 6's controversial \"open weapons\" default ruleset , the scenario is a perfect example of why letting any class use any gun disrupts the balance of Battlefield. \"A classic demonstration of why open classes don't work.

And if you're wondering just how much Star Wars has been ingested by Bungie's design team, at various points in the video we see a character frozen in carbonite, off-brand AT-ST walkers stomping across the battlefield, and a Sarlacc pit on Mars (which is doubling for Tatooine). Of course there is also much twirling of light sabers. Watch it below: Regular readers may recall that I was pretty down on having a galaxy far, far away smeared all over my favourite-but-troubled looter shooter. Specifically: I did not want to cosplay as Darth Vader . However, having had a better look at how the crossover is being handled, I have to confess I'm kinda into it. The set-up is this: A new Cabal faction called the Barant Imperium, who dress uncannily like chubby Stormtroopers, are stockpiling weapons on Mars at an alarming rate, seemingly aided by a member of The Nine, the bickering cosmic entities that provide t…",

Called Critterz, the film follows forest creatures who embark on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger—a fairly generic setup for a Pixar-esque tale of talking wildlife where it doesn't belong. But the real purpose of the project, according to a press release from production company Vertigo Films , is \"to prove that generative artificial intelligence can make movies faster and cheaper than Hollywood does today.\" Critterz has a budget of less than $30 million, far below what animated films like this typically cost—Toy Story 4, released in 2019, had a budget of approximately $200 million —and is expected to take only about nine months to make. Critterz was initially conceived by Chad Nelson, a \"creative specialist\" at OpenAI, and made its debut in a 2023 animated film based on images—\"every character, every background... basically the entire Crittzer world\"—generated by OpenAI's Dall.E image generation tool, which were \"handed to a t…",

Dark Deception is a horror game based around a Resi-style mazy hotel filled with lots of horrible monsters that has, per So It Goes, sold over six-and-a-half million copies and had 58 million players. The game was created by Glowstick CEO Vincent Livings, and will be adapted by Adrian Speckert and Cory Todd Hughes: there's no news yet on any casting or director. Glowstick's Dark Deception may have plenty of monsters, but it was a spinoff that led to a public spat with Monster Energy, the ubiquitous energy drink brand owned by Coca Cola. Part of Monster's marketing is aimed at the gamer demographic but, outside of official tie-ins like Death Stranding, this means it has been somewhat litigious within the games industry: it even took on Ubisoft over Immortals: Fenyx Rising (which was at one stage called Gods and Monsters).

As it turns out, that's on the menu too, and you don't even have to wait for it. Steel Soul mode is a permadeath mode that becomes available in the original Hollow Knight after completing the game for the first time, and it does indeed make the game more difficult: Just as in real life, death is not a condition from which one can recover. Steel Soul mode is also present in Silksong, revealed by the presence of the Steel Soul achievement on Steam. But as discovered by redditor Buttnugtaster —man, I love quoting redditors in news stories—the Steel Soul mode in Silksong is not restricted to replays.

This is a mistake, according to videogame market intelligence company Newzoo. In the free edition of the firm's 2025 Global Games Market Report , available today, Newzoo says that game publishers are causing \"avoidable cannibalization\" by all competing for attention and money at the same time of year. To come to its conclusion, Newzoo looked at triple-A singleplayer games that came out on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox between 2021 and 2024, defining triple-A in this case as games that cost $51 and up. February saw the most triple-A releases with 22, with October coming in just behind it with 21.

The ship from which you launch missions is a kind of mini hub, and I think does the job well, but some players want a more fleshed-out area to mingle with their fellow defenders of democracy and show off all those fancy capes they've been buying: the example usually given is Destiny 2's Tower. Jorjani was replying on Discord to a player asking for \"a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny.)\" Don't hold your breath: \"It's on the feature list for the next one,\" said Jorjani in response. This was not-unreasonably taken as a reference to Helldivers 3, but Jorjani quickly clarified this wasn't what he was on about. \"This was about our next game,\" said Jorjani , \"not HD3.\" (Image credit: Paradox Interactive ) OK, well that's enough for me to st…",

The Bardcore update and Boglands DLC drop simultaneously, on October 28. Bardcore will be free (hence \"free update,\" who'd have thought?) while Boglands will cost some money—how much remains to be seen. I don't know how much—developer Chasing Carrots has yet to slap a price tag on the new stuff, but with the base game costing a mere $6.66 (£5.49, because everything's less metal in Britain), I'm gonna venture a guess Boglands won't break your bank account. Unless your bank account has under five bucks in it, in which case you have my solidarity as another victim of capital. The free update by itself sounds pretty substantial. Bardcore brings a new character—the Bard, naturally—along with six new abilities for them, six new endgame artefacts, over 20 new quests, and manual level ups. Also, three new metal tracks, which is the most important entry on this list by quite some margin. But for the (p…",

Like our reviewer of the RX 9060 XT XFX Swift GPU , many have been pleased by the performance from the budget friendly offering. It seems it might have been a bit too quick, as new comparisons spotted by VideoCardz are showing ways the Samsung GDDR6 may actually be more beneficial, if a little less powerful than the SK Hynix offering. AMD partner XFX posted comparisons to Bilibili , a Chinese social blog site that often delves into PC gaming hardware critique. They tell the same story of less powerful GDDR6, but with a huge boon to cooling and potentially power consumption.

    "body": "Tackling the Great Taste of Pharloom quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is likely one of the most involved quests you'll pursue in the game. Feeding Loyal Mergwin's master in the Choral Chambers' dining hall requires you to collect five unique items from throughout the kingdom, which, in turn, means you'll have to explore extensively and acquire most of the game's movement abilities. You'll need both the Clawline and Faydown Cloak to grab the Crustnut and the Pickled Muckmaggot, not to mention that those abilities will help a lot when delivering the Courier's Rasher, on foot, to the dining hall and Loyal Mergwin. Here, I'll explain where to find each item in the Great Taste of Pharloom quest, and I've also included a video of my Courier's Rasher route so you know which way to go. Silksong Mossberry Stew location You can get the Mossberry Stew from the Moss Druid, though you likely have to complete her Berrypicking quest (Image credit: Team Cherry) The first one is always the simplest. To collect Mossberry stew, you simply have to go to see the Moss Druid who lives in Mosshome above Bone Bottom (accessible via The Marrow).

As demonstrated below by its co-creator, TikTok superstar Modern Biology , who seems to have taken to wandering around the forest in their pyjamas with the device in hand. Groovy.

If you get any of them wrong, you'll fail the theory section of the test, and that means you'll have to forge a much better weapon to be in with a chance.

Konami has effectively obliterated all trace of the game from existence, but that doesn't mean people don't reflect wistfully on what could have been. People like, for instance, Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya (via IGN ), who recently returned to one of his year-old threads on X to throw down the gauntlet over the game (kind of, in a very polite interpretation of throwing down a gauntlet). Per IGN's translation of the original Japanese, Kamiya wrote, \"If it’s impossible to resurrect PT, Kojima should make a new game in the same style… If Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go.\" A Kamiya-helmed PT sounds, well, kind of baffling.

Just announced for a 2026 release, the game brings together elements of roguelikes and autobattlers with a brilliantly weird, gross visual style created by artist John Kenn Mortensen . Set in a world where alchemists battle to drain goblins of their magical blood, it feels one part '80s fantasy, one part doodles out of the back of a troubled teenager's schoolbook, and one part something you'd see airbrushed onto the side of a van. I love it. I'd be sold on looks alone, but having gotten to play a section of Flask at Gamescom last month, I'm convinced there's a really solid roguelike here too. As you travel across a simple overworld map, you gather flasks for your homunculus warriors. These basically allow you to create a production line of actions in battle—one might be a simple attack, another a strength buff, and another a berserker strike that sacrifices health for damage. When you fight a goblin, each of you will run through all your flasks in order, and then if you're still alive, the process will continue to loop until goopy gre…",

However, for reasons that will become clear shortly, the journey between first opening the box and the publication of this review has been faltering and difficult. Had I issued my thoughts on the Create after a month of use—the typical period for reviewing an ergonomic keyboard—the final score and verdict would have been very different to what's on this page, and not in a positive way. But let's start at the beginning. Naya is a small company, based in the Netherlands, that was founded around four years ago by a group of three friends. Setting out with a goal of making the Create, a bespoke keyboard for ergonomics and productivity, Naya's designs and plans resulted in a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . Multiple batches of the Create have already been sold out and shipped, and along with the sheer amount of money raised via crowdfunding, it's clear that there are a lot of computer users around the world who very much want one. The obvious question to ask here is 'why?' and that's an easy one to answer. Naya Create specs (Image cr…",

And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what's particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business. In addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services. The custom silicon business that's perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021.

The news was broken by Japanese outlet Friday Digital , with a representative for Matha Farm confirming that the mare had passed due to colic, a pretty common cause of death in horses.

As always with these interviews, Yoshi-P often speaks in Japanese with a live interpreter, so specific word choice might be skewed based on the hard work of a poor translator having to suffer the Gamescom hall's terrible cafeteria prices and the stifling heat of a German summer. Still: \"When it comes to using the jobs in battle content and bringing out more of that uniqueness of each job, we are working on a big update.\" So far, so good, Yoshi-P.

Well, a little bit. As the patch notes linked above read, there'll be a \"Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter\", the former of which has been giving players considerable trouble . There'll also be a \"Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers\", which are the worms in the Blasted Steps—likely taking their damage from two masks to one. The game's rosary economy will also become less stingy: Relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries will all have their rosary rewards increased, though I imagine it'll still be hard to match the farming routes already found by players—mind, any rosary bump is a welcome one, given how miserly the game is with these things until Act 2. Speaking of, Act 2's benches and bellways will have their prices reduced, too, so you shouldn't have to grind nearly as much—a welcome adjustment, given I kept having to go back to the ol' Songclave Grand Reed mines. All in all, some pretty conservative reducti…",

Following in the footsteps of Hollow Knight multiplayer mods like HKMP , both these mods let you team up with a pal as you roam Pharloom. But before your head fills with visions of ganging up on bosses, some bad news: they both seem to be pretty much visual-only, at least for now. That is to say, you can have another Hornet hang out in your world (and vice versa), but I don't think you're gonna be taking on enemies together.

Enter Dave Plummer, an ex-Microsoft engineer whose other Windows contributions include Task Manager , native Zip file support, and Media Center, to name just a few (via The Register ). Speaking on his YouTube channel, Dave's Attic , Plummer revealed that when he ported the game to Windows NT from Windows 95, he wrote a whole new game engine around the original logic in order to handle the video rendering and sound. \"My game engine had a bug, in that it would draw frames as fast as it could\" said Plummer. At the time, the game was being coded on a MIPS R4000 processor running at a mighty 200 MHz, which resulted in the game running at 60-90 fps, a speed Plummer judged as \"plenty, for a game like that.\" \"Fast forward a couple of years later, somebody notices that o…",

Interpreting these shipping manifests from the NBD website is something of an art in itself. But short version is that there are entries for packaging for something listed as \"G31/C32\", where G31 is thought to be Intel's internal code for a new bigger GPU based on its latest Battlemage or Xe2 graphics tech, as used in the Intel Arc B580 cards you can (kinda) already buy.

Now, though, AMD has finally added the ability to enable FSR 4 in a bunch of games by flipping a toggle switch in the latest Adrenalin driver . The Adrenalin 25.9.1 drivers, AMD explains , enable FSR 4 in over 85 games: \"By updating your AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver, you automatically unlock access to this cutting-edge technology on your AMD Radeon RX 9000-series graphics card. Simply enable FSR 3.1 within the supported game and ensure the FSR 4 toggle is turned on from the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition application.\" These titles are limited to ones that support DirectX 12 and FSR 3.1—more specifically, games that \"have integrated a signed FSR 3.1 DLL according to the guidelines in our FSR 3.1 documentation for developers .\" That doesn't include Vulkan games, unfortunately.

While Sherma doesn't seem very good at the instrument he wields—he basically whacks two nails together towards a discordant \"melody\"—he's got a lovely voice on him, especially with an excess of cavernous reverb applied. Tee Lopes, a videogame composer who's worked on Sonic Mania and Shredder's Revenge, to name a few, has released a remix of Sherma's lil' jingle. It sounds a lot like that style of saccharine European dance pop that was big in the '90s and early 2000s: music that resembles Saturday morning cartoons, but which is actually precision-geared for dancing to while high. Very high. Here it is. I like how Hornet nods out of rhythm in the accompanying video. Bugs will be bugs. Lopes has also done one for Shakra, whose banger sounds like something the Vengaboys might have released at the height of their inexplicable popularity. In the words of YouTube commenter @Akif-Faisal: \"This is what entertainment looks like\". (It may also look, depending on your temperament, like something akin to torture.

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing, soon it will be Hornet's daaaay. Sorry. It was just in there . Blame Dean Martin! But now we can get on with it: here's where to find Silver Bells in Silksong to complete the Silver Bells wish. Silver Bells locations in Silksong (Image credit: Team Cherry) Once you've defeated the Silksong Widow boss and freed the town of Bellhart, you can find a wish board next to the town shopkeeper with several quests awaiting you. Accept the Silver Bells quest and then enter the Bellhart Bellway fast travel station. At the bottom of the station, instead of heading left to where you call the Bellbeast, head to the right and break the secret wall to enter the lower bellvein, a claustrophobic sequence of tunnels below the town. Here you'll find the crotchety Bell Hermit who doesn't have much to say; to his right is a narrow shaft that you can ascend using you…",

I can't think of a better way to kick off an FPS column than to gush about one of the best historical features of the genre, the server browser, while also lamenting its near extinction. It feels like shooters are ready for a shake up, but at least in this instance, I think publishers ought to look toward the past to guide them. Before every shooter had a quick match button, server lists were how we got around. If modern matchmaking is a multi-lane freeway, reliably but plainly escorting players in and out of matches curated by developers, server browsers were the scenic route: finding a place you liked to play took more time, but the results were always more interesting . Server browsers were a boon for variety, but as we've learned in the years since their disappearance, they were also crucial tools of preservation.

I’ve spent at least half as many hours reading about Silksong these past few days as I have playing it. And honestly, under the circumstances—the media didn’t get a head start here—that feels like the best way to go about playing and thinking about this curious game, which will likely delight or disappoint depending on your attitude going in. I really like it so far, but there are some things that annoy me about it, and I don't think it lives up to the hype through no fault of its own. I’m still not completely sure why Hollow Knight got as big as it did. I totally agree that it’s a great videogame and an outstanding metroidvania. Few games in this genre trust and reward the curiosity of the player as much as Hollow Knight did, and Silksong is no different in this regard. But this doesn't sufficiently explain its popularity. Maybe it's because Team Cherry's melancholy and quietly eccentric world is, in subtle ways, pretty different to anything we’ve explore…",
