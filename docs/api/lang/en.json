    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The “Now Playing” feature on Google Pixel devices is missing a key feature after a recent Android System Intelligence update. With the update, the Favorite tab is no longer visible in Now Playing. It’s an unwelcome change, especially as Google is preparing to overhaul Now Playing with a fresher design. “Now Playing” has been a small yet significant feature on the lock screen of Google Pixel devices. The feature silently listens to the music playing in the background and continually refreshes the lock screen or always-on display with information about the current track. Although Now Playing has existed in its current form for years, Google has been testing an upgraded version that displays album art , along with controls to play the track on your phone. Before that actually rolls out, we’re seeing an upsetting change to the current version, and we’re unsure if this is a bug or an intended switch. After Google recently pushed out the Android System Intelligence update, which bumped the version to B13 on eligible devices, Now Playing has lost one key feature. 9to5Google reported that it no longer shows a dedicated button for tracks marked…",

Pre-orders start on October 10 at $79.90, with shipping starting November 10. The budget Android gaming handheld market has burst wide open in the past few weeks. Sub-$100 devices like the MANGMI AIR X and AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini are poised to take entry-level handhelds to the next level, but there’s now a new challenger with a completely different approach. The MagicX One35 is a small handheld with a 3.5-inch IPS touchscreen display in a horizontal layout, but one thing makes it stand out from any other handheld on the market. Rather than dual joysticks, it includes two D-pads: one on the left in the upper position and another beneath the face buttons on the right.",

The new chipset has an upgraded CPU with SME2 support, a GPU with major ray tracing upgrades, and plenty more features. OPPO and vivo are expected to be the first brands to launch Dimensity 9500 phones in the coming weeks. MediaTek is the world’s largest smartphone processor company by market share, but the company has typically played second fiddle to Qualcomm in the premium space. Nevertheless, our testing shows that the recent Dimensity 9400 puts up a great fight against the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Now, MediaTek has revealed the next-generation Dimensity 9500 chipset, which will compete against the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Here’s what to expect from the new processor.",

A few months ago, I started thinking about switching to a Pixel for the first time since the Pixel 3 XL. After the Pixel 10 launched, I pulled the trigger and bought a 10 Pro . After six years in the realm of Samsung, switching from One UI to Google’s vision of Android has been a big adjustment. Some of those adjustments have been harder than others, and after a few weeks with my Pixel, these are the things I miss most from One UI. Samsung Clock I didn’t expect Samsung’s Clock app to be one of the things I missed most, but One UI 7 added features I haven’t seen in any other clock app. Alarm groups are like folders on your home screen, letting you place multiple alarms in one place. Toggling all of the alarms in a group with the press of a single button saves time and is so much easier than having to scroll through a list of alarms to find the right ones.",

However, some models are definitely better than others, and the phones certainly haven’t closed the gap on rivals that offer longer screen-on-time. Surprisingly, despite its larger battery, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has fared worse in our testing than the two smaller handsets. Anecdotally, we’ve struggled to reach much beyond four hours of screen-on time with the XL, while the regular Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro manage closer to five hours — or even a little more with lighter use. That’s a pretty significant discrepancy, and one we certainly didn’t expect.",

AYANEO’s first true budget handheld, the Pocket AIR Mini , is mostly noteworthy because of its $70 starting price, but today the company gave gamers a whole new reason to get excited. Not only will it be cheap, it will play games that many devices in its price range couldn’t even dream of running. In a surprise sharing session today, the company showcased game compatibility with demanding systems like the GameCube, PS2, and SEGA Saturn. These systems are generally considered beyond the reach of sub-$100 Android gaming handhelds , and some devices in the $150-$200 range struggle to run them at full speed.",

This feature will limit screen visibility from side angles, protecting privacy in crowded public places. It’s likely to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is rumored to have the necessary screen hardware. Stable One UI 8 recently started rolling out to Samsung’s phone lineup, but we’re already on to the next release. The first One UI 8.5 builds are already being tested, and we even have a look at some of the iOS 26-inspired design changes coming along. Thanks to the leaked build, we’ve also discovered some new features, such as a system for tackling photosensitive epilepsy , and the first mentions of Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro . We’ve now spotted clues about a new Private Display/Privacy Display feature that could tie in with a rumored Galaxy S26 Ultra feature.

A minimalist phone that serves my essential needs and nothing more. As a millennial with Gen Z tendencies, it’s pretty clear that I’m the audience for this phone. Every September, iPhones get bigger, heavier, and more stuffed with specs. It’s the progression of tech, and by and large, people value a phone by its hardware-to-dollar quotient. But with the iPhone Air, Apple has gone in the opposite direction. The phone is built impossibly slim, almost delicate, like a product designed as much as the set piece of a fashion-forward futuristic movie as for the Apple Store. It reminds me of the first-generation iPod nano. I scoffed at it when it launched. Then got my hands on it. It quickly became my favorite EDC kit.

Over the years, it has also positioned its brand as reliable, trustworthy, and to a point, even premium, convincing people to part with their money. However, no company is perfect. Samsung phones are generally among the most expensive on the market, their flagship series falls behind some of its competitors when it comes to features like fast charging, and pushing out the latest software updates often takes more time than we’d like.

Especially not when I have the highly regarded Pixel Stand 2nd Gen on my desk (which I’ll refer to as the Pixel Stand from here on out) against which to compare it. My first and most obvious complaint is: why bother? Yes, the magnets make for a satisfying snap on the back of my Pixel 10, but a dangling puck/cable is no more convenient than a USB-C cable. Plus, I can’t use the Pixelsnap to charge my headphones, tablet, or any other gadget I have lying around. Now, Google is happy to sell you the Pixelsnap Stand to make it into a more traditional dock. Still, at $70 for the complete setup (don’t forget you need to bring your own wall adapter), it’s a massively overpriced piece of plastic that should really have been included in the Pixelsnap’s box for free.

    "body": "TL;DR A recent bug is preventing Kindle owners from opening new sideloaded books. Amazon has confirmed the issue on its official forums and says a fix is in the works. For now, a useful workaround is to navigate to your book via the three dot menu. If you’ve recently tried to open a sideloaded book on your Kindle and hit a wall, you’re not alone. Starting this week, users across Reddit’s r/kindle community began reporting a sudden “Invalid ASIN” error message. The alert claims the selected title is not valid for Digital purchase on the Kindle, even when the book was loaded via USB or email rather than bought through Amazon’s storefront. Notably, the error only seems to affect unread sideloaded titles. Books that had been opened previously still launch as expected. Oddly enough, if you navigate by tapping the three dots, then Go to, then select a chapter, you can crack open affected books. Toggling Airplane Mode can also help you escape a redirect loop to the Kindle Store, though it hasn’t worked for everyone.",

What’s even more fascinating is that Voice Translate attempts to mimic the voice of the speakers in order to make conversations sound more natural.

The vast majority of your smartphone usage probably takes place in portrait mode, ideal for one-handed operation. When we’re turning our phones for landscape viewing, that’s usually tied to a very specific purpose, like watching a movie, gaming, or shooting with the camera. What about making a call, though? That’s not normally something we associate with rotating our phones , so we’re finding it easy to understand why so many Android users are suddenly confused by landscape-orientation calls. We first caught wind of this thanks to a post in Reddit’s Pixel sub from user whappenow , who shared that the Phone app on their Pixel had recently started going into landscape mode. Unless you’re making a call through earbuds, or rocking an insane handset like the LG Wing , landscape isn’t really a screen orientation that makes a ton of sense for phone calls.",

Google is now testing a new Gemini-powered way to simplify discovery, and it’s already rolling out for some US accounts. Telegram user @blank94855 gave us a heads-up that version 47.9.30-31 of Google Play Services introduces an AI app explorer in the Play Store’s search tab. We’ve since confirmed the feature for ourselves on a US-based device.",

The company is also enhancing Chrome’s protections to make browsing safer. Accessing AI Mode is fairly simple, and it doesn’t take much time to do. All you have to do is go to Google Search and click or tap on the AI Mode tab. But if that’s not fast enough for you, the tech giant has a new way for you to access the feature. In the Chrome browser , you’ll now find an AI Mode chip sitting in the omnibox. After you type something into the bar, you can hit the chip and it will take you directly to AI Mode.",

Deadlines would only be an option to add when editing a task, rather than when it’s created. The test version does not allow you to specify a deadline time and does not display the due date in the main list view. Google Tasks has always been a bare-bones tool. For some, that’s part of the appeal, but its stripped-down approach often leaves power users wanting more . The lack of sharing, location-based reminders, or even simple priority options makes it feel like a lightweight option compared to fuller apps like TickTick. Google does seem to be listening to the critics and experimenting with upgrades, though. We recently spotted potential upcoming support for attaching Google Drive files to tasks through Calendar.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is putting together its framework for Android developer verification, connecting dev names to even sideloaded apps. Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate. One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection. Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity , and block the installation of apps from unverified sources. For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes ( my own included ), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).",

After weeks of teasers, AYANEO has finally given us a full look at its upcoming budget handheld, the Pocket AIR Mini. And unlike its previous “value” releases like the $239 KONKR Pocket FIT , this one comes in at well under $100. Sporting a MediaTek G90T SoC and 2GB or 3GB of RAM, the Pocket AIR Mini is far from the company’s premium, flagship products. And the pricing reflects that.",

The new feature lets you select a watch face design and send your custom bot directly to your connected smartwatch from the phone app. This functionality requires Wear OS 6 because it uses a new API, and while it works, it has not officially rolled out to users yet. Earlier this month, Google brought its Androidify app back from the grave. The company updated the app to leverage its latest AI models to create a fully personalized Android Bot from a photo or text prompt. The result is amazing, making the new Androidify app a great tool for generating social media avatars , especially for Android fans. While it’s easy to set your custom Android Bot as your wallpaper, banner, or avatar, setting it as your watch face is not so straightforward. Most watch faces don’t support custom images, preventing you from showing off your personalized bot. Fortunately, Google is working on an update to the Androidify app that will introduce several watch faces designed to place your Android Bot front and center on your smartwatch.",
