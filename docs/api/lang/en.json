    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Viral videos show the Pixel 10 Pro XL completely glitching out while running the latest version of Genshin Impact. The problems could be related to the Pixel 10 shipping with a PowerVR GPU, for which the game’s makers dropped support earlier this year. A future driver update might fix performance issues, but if game developers keep dropping support for PowerVR GPUs, Google may need to rethink its strategy. Videos showing the Pixel 10 Pro XL glitching while running one of the most popular Android games — Genshin Impact — have been circulating on social media over the weekend. In these clips, textures flicker, controls misbehave, and the screen tears apart after the latest update to the game, giving people another reason to heavily criticize Google’s choice of GPU this year. But are things really as bad as they appear?",

OpenAI and former Apple designer Jony Ive announced work on a mysterious new AI device last year, and we’ve heard a few details since then.

Furthermore, the outlet’s sources say these issues could delay the device’s release. However, one source said these problems were typical of the product development process.",

Google’s AI tool has captured the interest of anyone who deals with numerous large documents and files, becoming essential for thousands of students, lawyers, marketers, and more. We even use it here on Android Authority to make some of our internal guides interactive. Just ask a question and get the answer straight from the documentation. NotebookLM is fantastic for that. It’s a powerful search tool, study buddy, and assistant in one. Plus, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools trained on quasi-infinite data; it just uses the sources you give it, so you know you’ll be getting a proper answer. My problem with it is that it hides the source away when it’s a PDF file, and that really limits its usefulness for anything other than text.",

I’ve already mentioned why Spotify Duo is perfect for my household, and then there’s Spotify Connect, which lets me control music on my PS4 and other devices through my phone. I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

Still, I’m sure we all know a few holdouts, or you might be one yourself. A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths . Many of those points still hold, but awareness has improved, and so has prepaid market penetration. When you remove some of the most common myths from the equation, what are the real reasons people still don’t switch to prepaid? I dug into the most common ones I hear from friends, family, and online communities. Here are the biggest reasons some people say prepaid isn’t worth the switch.

Nearly half of survey respondents preferred YouTube Music — taking out the “other” option, YouTube Music got more votes than all the other options in our survey combined.",

This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence.

Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor.

Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now.

If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements.

Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route.

If you live in the US, it’s one of the only tablet-style foldables you can buy in the country, and while not a dramatic upgrade over its predecessor, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold still brings a lot to the table — such as its new Tensor G5 chip, IP68 rating, and built-in magnetic charging. There’s plenty to like about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but priced at $1,799, it’s one of those phones that requires careful consideration before purchase. And before any purchase this big, it’s well worth considering your other options.",

It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models.

Originally, the plan required constant location sharing, but that requirement has now been removed. Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

Google announced the Pixel Watch 4 in August 2025 , alongside the Pixel 10 series , but retail availability for the watch will only open up on October 9. That’s still a week away, but it appears some customers are already getting their hands on the Pixel Watch 4 ahead of its official release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Recently, some Galaxy Watch owners have noticed their sleep scores rising through the stratosphere. With no obvious behavioral changes to blame, this may be due to a change in the sleep score algorithm. Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of. But are you sure you can trust that data? Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Last month, this stopped working, and Gemini will only create new pictures that are square. Google says that it’s working on a fix, and there are some workaround you can use until then. If you’ve used modern AI chatbots enough, this probably is going to sound very familiar: You construct a prompt containing one or more very specific restrictions, and then watch as the result you get just utterly ignores those limitations. I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place. But what’s currently going on with Gemini and image generation is proving to be nothing short of maddening.",
