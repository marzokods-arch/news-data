If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade before the holiday chaos hits, the savings are hard to ignore. The standout is the Dreame X50 Ultra, a high-end robot vacuum built for homes where most bots still get tripped up. Its chassis can lift itself to climb over thresholds and door sills, and the corner-reaching system helps it clean further into tight spots than you normally get from a round robot. It also handles hair better thanks to its detangling brush setup, and the base station washes and dries the mop pads with high heat, so you’re not left dealing with damp fibers.

It will feature a 4.7-inch 120Hz display and a Dimensity 8300 SoC in a vertical form factor. It could be officially announced as early as this week. ANBERNIC got a late start this year, but it’s been absolutely churning out new Android gaming handhelds over the past few months. The PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , the all-metal RG 477M , and the upcoming dual-screened RG DS are highlights, but leaks indicate that there’s a new device on the horizon. Renders and photos of an engineering sample of the RG 477V have leaked on the Retro Handhelds Discord . If they turn out to be correct (which is almost always the case), the vertical handheld will have the same 4.7-inch 120Hz screen and Dimensity 8300 SoC as the RG 477M.",

Officials reported that Levin, who was home alone, barricaded herself in the bathroom and called 911 after she heard the suspects enter through a shattered sliding glass door. NBC 4 reported that Levin heard the intruders walk upstairs and open the bedroom door and when she peeked out of the bathroom they saw her and ran off.

Now, the vivo X300 Pro is here for global customers, and this phone supports the same external lens kit. The lens will be available in global markets, much like the OPPO Find X9 Pro’s lens attachment . And I’d argue that this is the combo to get if you want long-range zoom. Hear me out.",

When it comes to emulation, the experience often feels less like a console and more like a tedious series of menus and poorly labeled files. Emulation frontends like ES-DE and Beacon try to fix this, but none are as ambitious as iiSU. First revealed two months ago, a slick new video highlighting planned features was released yesterday.

More curious is the company’s choice to make direct performance comparisons to its far older 8 Gen 3 (36% better performance and 42% better efficiency), which was released in late 2023, rather than the original 8 Elite.

The newly spotted color palettes enhance contrast and make the widget easier to use. The icons for mic, Lens, and AI mode also appear bigger. The November Pixel Drop arrived recently, replete with several visual upgrades for both new and old Pixel devices. Around the same time, Google also released the latest edition of Android 16’s QPR2 beta , though primarily focusing on under-the-hood improvements. With the stable QPR2 update expected in the coming weeks, we’re learning about a slight visual upgrade it brings, adding a splash of vivid colors to the homescreen on Pixel devices. The persistent Google search bar, part of the Pixel launcher, may be getting radiant colors that better match your wallpaper, as 9to5Google notes. With this change, we could see new colors take over and replace older ones, as seen with Android 16’s QPR1 stable release.",

WhatsApp has been working on adding more creative tools to the status feature, which is great. However, creating a status often becomes a time-consuming process, and it’s pretty common to get interrupted when you’re halfway through. Unfortunately, if you exit the status-creation screen, you will lose your progress and have to start over. WhatsApp v2.25.36.6 includes code for allowing users to save their status as a draft, similar to Instagram, helping fix one of the biggest annoyances in the process.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, which is built on TSMC’s 3nm manufacturing process, is positioned as the less impressive but still “premium” companion of the 8 Elite Gen 5.

Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.

ESA/DLR/FU Berlin, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO Results from an enhanced radar technique have demonstrated improvement to sub-surface observations of Mars. &nbsp; NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has revisited and raised new questions about a mysterious feature buried beneath thousands of feet of ice at the Red Planet’s south pole. In a recent study, researchers conclude from data obtained using an innovative radar technique that an area on Mars suspected of being an underground lake is more likely to be a layer of rock and dust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2018 discovery of the suspected lake set off a flurry of scientific activity, as water is closely linked with life in the solar system.

In other words, developers are shipping their game emulators disguised as other apps. Why would they do that? Well, it’s all about maximizing performance. The theory is simple: most smartphones optimize for specific use cases, often sacrificing peak performance for many apps to reduce temperatures and prolong battery life. Your web browser doesn’t need to run your chip at full tilt, after all. However, some devices game the system by unlocking maximum performance for listed applications, sometimes for specific games, and occasionally to improve their benchmark results. By “spoofing” one app to appear as another, a developer can trick the system into unlocking maximum performance that might not have been otherwise available. This is pretty handy if you’re trying to emulate something extremely demanding.",

However, the jewel in the Google smartphone crown is indeed now down to just $899 on Amazon, saving you $300 off the recommended retail price. This marks its lowest price yet, and we’d be surprised if it got any cheaper this holiday season. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is equipped with a stunning 6.8-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED screen, offering up to 3,300 nits peak brightness and a fluid 120Hz refresh rate. Powered by the Tensor G5 chip, you get 16GB of RAM and storage options starting from 256GB. Google backs it with a seven-year update pathway, giving it future-proofing that’s hard to beat.",

At first glance, the new Honor Choice Bee AI Projector Air looks like a basic compact projector, but it also supports stylus input and gesture controls. In other words, the device can turn your wall into a makeshift writing surface. It’s an odd combo that is definitely niche, yet potentially useful for your next game night. For now, the device has only launched in China, but it introduces a unique angle to the budget projector space. The device itself is lightweight and unobtrusive, with an adjustable stand that tilts the unit up to 160 degrees, meaning you can project onto a ceiling. For specs, Honor lists 1080p resolution and 280 CVIA lumens of brightness. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI 2.0, USB, and a headphone jack. It also features a built-in 5W speaker.",

It’s a massive 32:9 curved DQHD panel that essentially gives you the screen real estate of two 27-inch QHD monitors stitched together without bezels getting in the way.

Google Support claims the issue is fixed, but users continue to complain that the EIS bug persists. As a workaround, you can temporarily fix the stutter by disabling “Video stabilization” in the Pixel Camera settings. We’ve previously covered the Pixel 10 Pro’s jerky zoom videos and how users had to settle for workarounds to get usable video recordings despite paying over $1,000 for a top-tier flagship. The issue has affected users for months, and while customer support has claimed to some users that the problem has been “fixed,” users claim that it still persists. So we want to ask you: Are you still facing issues when recording video with the Pixel 10 Pro’s telephoto zoom? Reddit user No_Particular7571 had previously spotted that their new Pixel 10 Pro shot very jerky video through its telephoto camera, particularly when panning or moving. However, the stuttering completely disappears when you turn off EIS in the Pixel Camera app, indicating there is a bug in Google’s EIS implementation that conflicts with the phone’s OIS.",
