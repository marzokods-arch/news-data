    "body": "Deadlock, the MOBA shooter that Valve would still like us to pretend hasn't launched even as it receives major additions whose patch notes span pages of tastefully produced graphical treatments, has been drawing attention with its Old Gods, New Blood update. As of last week, Deadlock's boasting an updated map, a new mode, all sorts of quality-of-life tinkering, and six characters gradually being doled out according to the whims of player base democracy. The update's best new feature, however, isn't mentioned anywhere in all that lovely web design. To find it, you'll have to crawl through some vents. Shortly after the Old Gods update launched, players discovered the Deadlock's updated map had peppered the streets of its necromantic New York with small vents, crawlspaces, and apertures that—while too narrow for most of the roster to traverse—clearly led somewhere. Once Deadlock players selected Rem , a spritely little dream-imp, as their first choice for the update's new character rollout, those nooks and crannies suddenly became much more navigable. \"An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams,\" is an adorable, nightcapped, candle-carrying crow-cat with a suite of sleep-related…",

First noticed by Shinobi602 on Bluesky , Bloober's countdown website at remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com (which as far as I know remains undeciphered) now features a stylized image of a rose, and the message \"Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.\" Put your cursor on the rose and it drips some kind of liquid—blood, I suppose. (Image credit: Bloober Team) There's also a similarly drippy \"play\" button on the page, which if clicked delivers a scratchy message that a quick search reveals is an overwrought recitation of a William Blake poem, The Sick Rose , originally published in 1794 as part of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection: O Rose thou art sick.

The biggest thrills you can find in that game are on horseback—galloping across plains, jumping off slopes, and blasting foes off their own horses as you circle each other like sharks. That only happens incidentally, though. At its heart, Highguard is a game about farming Vesper (money but blue) and loot in the open world, then overpowering the enemy team… for the first few minutes of a round, at least. Then it's about competing to grab and escort the Shieldbreaker, sort of like capture the flag. Once that's done, it's about sieging the enemy base; you plant bombs in their fortress, and they try to stop you by putting up reinforced walls, defusing the bombs, and holding out for long enough. By that point you're shuffled into a cramped base where the horse doesn't matter anymore, and you've kind of forgotten why you had one to begin with. The sense I get is that Highguard wants to make a smoothie of the most dominant competitive games' best ingredients—the role-based teamplay and tide-turning ultimate ability spew of a MOBA, the frantic scavenging of a battle royale, the wall-breaching tactics of Rainbow Six, and so on.

This session resulted in broad agreement among the group about what a succession plan should look like, and an explicit plan for what to do next (which has now started). A brief explainer of Torvalds' importance before we get into things. The Linux kernel development project has over 100 programmers each working to maintain and incorporate changes in their own repositories. But the final step in any Linux release is where all of this work is centralised and incorporated into the mainline repository: this has on almost every occasion been done by Torvalds. The succession session was led by Dan Williams, principal engineer at Intel and Linux kernel maintainer, who got right into things by describing it as an uplifting subject linked to \"our eventual march toward death,\" before offering to change the topic to Link tags if folk got upset.

Ubisoft announced the overhaul of its studio structure last week, a process that includes the cancellation of six games in development (including the repeatedly-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), multiple delays, and the closures of \"several studios,\" with attendant layoffs. It followed that up with a demand that all employees return to full time in-office work , and then initiated a 'Rupture Conventionnelle Collective' process in order to reduce the workforce at its Paris HQ by 200 people. Naturally, there was also fresh noise about AI . The Solidaires Informatique union called for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris immediately after the restructuring was announced, and warned that move was merely an \"initial response to the absurdity of management decisions.\" Now the union, along with four others—CFE-CGC, CGT, Printemps écologique, and Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo—are taking the next step: A company-wide walkout. \"We are promised autono…",

The early details for this month's PC-specific follow-up patch, which touted additional graphics and CPU options alongside the vague promise of yet more \"CPU/GPU optimization,\" didn't inspire confidence either. I'm pleased to say that, for once, I was wrong to doubt. The Steam-centric patch arrived last night, and—while I wish it hadn't taken almost a year for me to be able to write this—it certainly seems like a Monster Hunter Wilds performance improvement patch has finally, substantially improved performance. Sometimes when a patch note says \"CPU/GPU optimization,\" it really means it. (Image credit: Capcom) Still, I'm going to ask that we all limit any sudden movements or loud noises.

That's not to say there aren't legitimate complaints to be made about the game, because there absolutely are, but there's no doubt in my mind that Bloodlines 2 would've been received far more warmly if it hadn't hitched its wagon to a game people just refuse to be normal about. Anyway, now I've got that off my chest, this is what we're actually here for: Paradox and The Chinese Room have rolled out the Bloodlines 2 roadmap for 2026 , laying out what's coming over the course of the next year.

These games can be as scary as it gets, and Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly is one of the most downright freaky there is. Publisher Koei Tecmo and its Team Ninja studio are in the final stages of a remake, imaginatively enough called Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, and has today announced a new demo for the game, as well as a collaboration with Silent Hill f. The secret sauce with Fatal Frame is that you don't have anything in the way of traditional weaponry, but you do have the Camera Obscura, a device that can….

Every other week, I cover topics relevant to first-person shooter enjoyers, spanning everything from multiplayer and singleplayer to the old and the new. While the internet reckons with another premature hate campaign against a hero shooter that's just OK, a genuinely exciting new multiplayer FPS is passing most of us by. Not to pick too much on Highguard (review forthcoming), but every minute I'm playing it, I wish I were playing Out of Action instead. Out of Action is the debut project from solo dev Doku Games. After years of dazzling us with clips of electrifying movement and backflip headshots, Out of Action finally landed in early access last week. It's very much a work in progress—basic features like \"weapon reload animations\" and \"non-test maps\" are bound to a roadmap for now—but what it's already got is strong: 12-player lobbies (team or FFA) A real server browser (with dedicated servers) Deep loadout customization and progression A simple leaderboard Two objective modes (with more planned) Also, it's $20 and features zero microtransactions.

So much so that the majority of enthusiasts only upgrade their systems piecemeal, one component every so often, or get a new rig after many long years. But if you were hoping to build a new gaming PC or update the CPU and motherboard this year, the shocking cost of DRAM kits right now is making the process considerably challenging. Back in July 2025, you could pick up a 32 GB kit of DDR5-6000, with a CAS latency of 30 cycles, for under $90 (albeit during the sales). For AMD Ryzen processors, you honestly wouldn't need anything better, and although Intel's chips can handle faster DRAM, they'll still be just as happy with a kit like that. Now, the same set of memory costs $480 at Amazon , and should you want RGB lighting or DRAM from Corsair or G.Skill, then you'll be handing over a lot more cash. You can pay less, of course, as this 32 GB kit from PUSkill is $300 at Amazon , for instance. No, I've never heard of that brand before, either, but one reason why it's so much cheaper is its speed and timings.

Mechborn is definitely that, inserting cards and turn-based fights into a world of giant mechs battling kaiju. (Image credit: Turtle Juice) It's a great concept, and the chunky visuals and hi-tech UI sell it well. With music that has more than a touch of the Pacific Rim theme to it, and surreal monsters right out of a '90s anime, it wears its influences on its sleeve—but it does them justice. A roguelike deckbuilder lives or dies on its mechanics, however, and heading into a run with an early build of the game, I was at first worried Mechborn might be style over substance.

The prices of pretty much all memory-related products have been spiralling upwards of late. But the cost of producing memory products has surely not increased as much. The result, pretty obviously from SK Hynix's published results, is that a lot more money is being made on each memory chip. So, apart from the obvious upside for SK Hynix's shareholders, is there any good news here? The company did talk about the investments it is making in production capacity. \"Having successfully completed the preparation stages to mass produce HBM4 – for the first time…",

Despite how many trips you've undoubtedly taken here, it doesn't make scoping out locations to find cover spots any easier. Similar to the With a View and Prime Specimen quests, you'll also have to nab an item to complete Combat Recon. In this case, it's a Spotter Relay, which is better than having to take down the Bombardier itself, I suppose. If you don't already have one, just look for the Bombardier's recon drones at Marano Park, Plaza Rosa, or Parking Garage. Below, I'll go over the exact locations you need to visit to complete the Combat Recon quest. Take note that you can do these in any order, so head to whichever area you're closest to when you spawn in.

The Worldsoul Saga is one of Blizzard's most ambitious moves yet—committing to a three-expansion story arc where everything's been more-or-less planned out, giving them the chance to tell larger, bigger-reaching narratives. Narratives where someone is gonna bite the dust at some point, most likely. That's per an interview by PCG contributor Heather Newman, written for issue 420 of our magazine that'll be hitting shelves soon. Heather spoke to both game director Ion Hazzikostas and design director Maria Hamilton about Midnight , the midpoint of the Worldsoul Saga—and both WoW leads emphasised that the team is winding up for some big swings. \"There will be important characters that do not survive the trilogy.

If you're interested in oddities from the period you probably know Inscape as the publisher of the aforementioned Drowned God, but also Bad Day on the Midway, which was directed by members of surrealist rock troupe The Residents, and almost received a TV adaptation by—take a breath—David Lynch. Inscape was a dab hand at sicko-friendly adventures in other words, which can probably be attributed to its proximity with the film and music worlds (it was funded by HBO and Warner Music Group). Which brings us to The Dark Eye. This 1995 point 'n' click adventure is based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, and features voice acting by writer and artist William S. Burroughs.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. In the 1980s and early 1990s if you wanted a videogame with a decently written story, adventure games were the only place to find them. Back then RPGs were mostly dungeon crawls, or full of olde worlde thee-and-thou guff. Immersive sims didn't exist. Visual novels were rarely translated into English. Other genres would give you a paragraph of text and a pat on the back, then send you on your way. Because point-and-click adventures evolved out of text adventures they brought some of text's wordiness with them. When you wanted to adapt a book to a videogame, whether it was The Hobbit or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, adventure games were the way to do it. Studios like Infocom, LucasArts, and Sierra valued characters, settings, and themes more than anyone else. Of course to talk to those characters, explore those settings, and understand those themes first you'd have to solve the puzzles. Adventure games were infamous for gating progress with puzzles that mad…",

Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 kicks off with a Steph flashback set 200 years ago when she was a Canadian citizen sent to an internment camp by the invading Americans (one of whom mockingly called her a hoser, no less) and then watched her Mom die in front of her. Mom's advice before she expires: \"Don't think of them as human beings, think of them as Americans.\" That's all Steph needs to hear before throat-slashing her way across the border and making her way to Las Vegas where she runs into Cooper Howard and an unconscious Hank MacLean. I guess when Hank woke up he admired her cutthroat (literally) attitude and made her one of Bud's Buds, which secured her a cryopod in the Vault. Alas, things are not going great for Steph in the present. She's getting a lot of pushback from Overseer Betty of Vault 33, and even worse, from her soon-to-be husband, Chet, who she didn't even bother informing about their impending wedding.

But, as is usually the case with Terraria updates, what was originally meant to be a fairly straightforward Dead Cells crossover pack turned into something much bigger, requiring just over three years to develop. The resulting update has patch notes of near biblical proportions, but not everything included in Bigger and Boulder is listed: \"As always, we never share everything that is in each update,\" reads the update notes , \"not even in the 'full' changelog. Part of the fun is in the discovery!\" Very few aspects of Terraria are left untouched with 1.4.5, which is available right now. There's new items galore, and a hugely overhauled crafting system with which to make them. Inventory management has been overhauled, as has world seed functionality. On that note, a new \"skyblock\" world seed now exists which, as the name implies, resembles a floating island. According to ReLogic it \"introduces entirely new gameplay dynamics and ru…",

Frostrail I'm probably most jazzed about Frostrail from FakeFish, maker of excellent submarine survival game Barotrauma. In this solo or co-op survival FPS, brave the deadly cold as you scavenge for resources and fight swarms of hostiles. Upgrade your engine so it can speed faster and pull more weight as you restlessly explore a frozen world. \"Your train is more than a refuge, it is your only way forward.

There's nothing wrong with Genshin Impact, but I only need so many open world action RPGs where you meet anime characters you can collect like Pokémon, and most of the copycats don't have anything else going on. Arknights: Endfield , however, does have something else going on: surprisingly robust factory building . I can't name another gacha game where you mine raw materials and process them in a maze of conveyor belts. Factorio always looked like a game I'd never click with, but Endfield has turned me into the kind of person who can spend hours reorganizing their base just to make it slightly more efficient. The problem now is that I like the factory building so much that I'm disappointed when Endfield interrupts it to make me play more of its sad sci-fi Genshin Impact-style adventure with characters that make me want to turn the sound off.

As noted on its Steam page , the game contains \"an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor,\" and that description seems to have raised at least one questioning eyebrow at Valve HQ. According to publisher No More Robots, Valve needed to know more about this orgy. In fact, Valve needed to see this orgy. For reasons . \"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy,\" says the publisher. \"We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification.\" Yes, yes, verification and context.

The message was accompanied by a photo of strategically-placed gaming peripherals, a \"brain fuel\" drink, a knife for some reason, and a Highguard launch event pass, presumably proof that he was on the scene.
