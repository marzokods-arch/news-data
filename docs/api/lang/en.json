In an unexpected move, Robbie Williams has surprise-released his new album, Britpop , three weeks earlier than originally planned. The road to the superstar’s 13th studio album has already been full of twists and turns. First announced last May, the record was slated for release Oct. 10, though was then pushed back to Feb. 6 due to “scheduling issues.” At an i ntimate show at London’s Dingwalls venue Oct. 9, Williams admitted that this was actually due to avoid the arrival of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl (Oct. 3) and its subsequent chart domination. “We’re all pretending [the scheduling change] is not about Taylor Swift, but it f–king is &#8212; you can’t compete with that,” Williams said on stage. “I was worried about making [fans] all wait for the record. But then I was like, ‘F–k it.’ I’m sorry, but I’m f–king being selfish. How many times in your life do you get to have the most No. 1 albums the U.K. has f–king ever had?” It was a shrewd decision: Swift’s record remained atop the summit of the U.K.&#8217;s Official Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks upon release.

BNGM&#8217;s mission is to establish the value of this content not simply as mere game background music but as independent music content that goes beyond the bounds of games.

Credits: NASA/Ross Walter and Allison Nussbaum When oyster farmer Luke Saindon went looking for a place to grow shellfish in Maine, he knew that picking the wrong patch of water could sink the farm before it began. So Saindon did something oyster farmers couldn’t have done a generation ago: He used NASA satellite data to view the coastline from space. “Starting a farm is a big venture,” said Saindon, the director for The World Is Your Oyster farm in Wiscasset, Maine. “If you choose the wrong spot, you can blow through a lot of money without ever bringing oysters to market.” NASA satellites had been passing over these waters for years, recording temperatures and other conditions.

Reipurth (Planetary Science Institute); Processing: Gladys Kober (NASA/Catholic University of America) This new NASA&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope &nbsp;image captures a jet of gas from a forming star shooting across the dark expanse. The bright pink and green patches running diagonally through the image are HH 80/81, a pair of Herbig-Haro (HH) objects previously observed by Hubble in 1995. The patch to the upper left is part of HH 81, and the bottom streak is part of HH 80. Herbig-Haro objects are bright, glowing regions that occur when jets of ionized gas ejected by a newly forming star collide with slower, previously ejected outflows of gas from that star. HH 80/81’s outflow stretches over 32 light-years, making it the largest protostellar outflow known.&nbsp; Protostars are fed by infalling gas from the surrounding environment, some of which can be seen in residual “accretion disks” orbiting the forming star.&nbsp; Ionized material within these disks can interact with the protostars’ strong magnetic fields, which channel some of the particles toward the pole and outward in the form…",

La temperatura global de la superficie terrestre en 2025 fue un poco más cálida que en 2023 pero, dentro de los márgenes de error, ambos años está prácticamente empatados, según un análisis realizado por científicos de la NASA. Desde que comenzaron los registros en 1880, 2024 sigue siendo el año más caluroso. Las temperaturas globales en 2025 fueron más frías que en 2024, con temperaturas promedio de 1,19° Celsius (2,14° Fahrenheit) por encima del promedio para el período de 1951 a 1980. El análisis del Instituto Goddard de Estudios Espaciales de la NASA incluye datos de la temperatura del aire obtenidos por más de 25.000&nbsp;estaciones meteorológicas en todo el mundo, así como por instrumentos a bordo de barcos y boyas que miden la temperatura de la superficie del mar, y estaciones de investigación en la Antártida. Los datos son analizados utilizando métodos que toman en cuenta la distribución cambiante de las estaciones de medición de temperatura y los efectos del calentamiento urbano que podrían sesgar los cálculos.
