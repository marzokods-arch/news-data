This would be in line with previous Galaxy flagships, dating back to the Galaxy S23 range. This claim suggests that any image quality upgrades might come via software processing. Samsung’s Galaxy S flagship phones have offered the same selfie cameras for a few years now. However, there’s bad news if you were hoping for a selfie camera upgrade on the Galaxy S26 phones .

The Life of a Showgirl has some of the big drums and plenty of the big hooks of this trio&#8217;s extended collaboration a decade earlier, but the songwriting and sonic palette are both updated for the mid-2020s, with many tracks based around an organic-skewing pop-rock sound more reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac than Forever Your Girl . Plenty of its songs seem destined to impact on a similar scale though: &#8220;Actually Romantic&#8221; and &#8220;Wood&#8221; will be the headline-grabbers for their provocative subject matters, but &#8220;Ruin the Friendship&#8221; and &#8220;Eld…",

The late Michaels&#8217; estate issued a statement on Swift&#8217;s recording on Thursday (Oct. 2), hours before the official release of Showgirl . “We were delighted when Taylor Swift and her team approached us earlier this year about incorporating an interpolation of George Michael’s classic song ‘Father Figure’ into a brand new song of the same title to be featured on her forthcoming album,&#8221; George Michael Entertainment said in a note posted on Michael&#8217;s social media accounts. &#8220;When we heard the track we had no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists and we know George would have felt the same. George Michael Entertainment wishes Taylor every success with The Life of a Showgirl and Father Figure.” Michael&#8217;s &#8220;Father Figure&#8221; held steady for two weeks at No. 1 on the&nbsp;Billboard Hot 100&nbsp;in 1988; it was one of four No. 1 smashes from Faith , his 1987 solo debut LP…",

If they didn’t have enough crime happening around them, eufy encouraged users to film themselves pretending to be package thieves. It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models. And this week we’re learning about a clever way one company looked to crowdsource an effort like that — even if it cut a few corners along the way.

She was just 13 years old when she played Miley Stewart, a teenager leading a secret double life as a Malibu student by day and a global pop star by night. The show ran until 2011. After her success on the show, Cyrus made a bold transformation with a more edgy and provocative image, releasing albums like 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed and 2013’s Bangerz , the latter debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

As the company puts more focus on wireless and wired internet services , the cellular network in many ways remains as it always has: very reliable and consistent where it’s strong, but with notable weaknesses in markets where it’s less invested. It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well. That said, there are plenty of great alternatives to AT&amp;T if you are willing to give prepaid a chance.",

The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",

Data makes talking about certain subjects enormously easier, and that’s probably no more true than it is for quality of sleep. Sure, you could subjectively rate your experience as sleeping well or not, but it’s long been very difficult to actually compare that with anyone else’s experience, or even track our own experiences night-to-night. Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been absolutely game-changers in this regard, empowering us to finally do some data-driven analytics on what’s probably the biggest part of our lives that we’re also least aware of.

I recently had just such an experience, trying to use Gemini to cheat at Blue Prince solve some word puzzles, and even when directing that I wanted only 6-letter answers, still got a bunch of 7- and 8-letter responses. Normally, when you point this out to an AI system, it revises its output accordingly, eventually giving you want you wanted in the first place.

I’ve been on Team Pixel for years, and when the Pixel 10 series launched, I jumped on the Pixel 10 Pro on day one. And honestly? I absolutely love it. It’s a phenomenal device that packs an incredible amount of power into a relatively compact and beautifully designed body. The camera system is a dream, the software is clean and intuitive, and even the subtle Moonstone colorway makes me happy whenever I pick it up. However, I’m also keenly aware that not everyone can afford a $1,000 smartphone. For many people, the premium features of a “Pro” moniker, especially the fancy camera tricks, are overkill for their daily needs. This is where the standard Google Pixel 10 comes in. It promises the core Pixel experience at a much more palatable price point.",

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

Wearables have increasingly been hailed as guardians of human lives. Close-to-medical-grade detection techniques already alert us to certain conditions, even before symptoms progress in the body. While hypertension , sleep apnea , or Atrial Fibrillation can now be commonly detected on smartwatches, AI is enhancing the scope of detection and utility, accelerating detection with fewer data points. With this, Samsung is working on a feature to detect another leading cause of heart failure, right from your wrist.
