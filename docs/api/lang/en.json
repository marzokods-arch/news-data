    "body": "If you’ve been using Android phones as long as me, it’s impossible that you haven’t dabbled in Nova Launcher at some point. In fact, I’d say that Nova Launcher has been the go-to app for Android customization for well over a decade. It earned that well-deserved status by giving users more control than stock launchers ever could, from how icons looked to how gestures worked to how the app drawer was laid out. But all good things come to an end, and the development of the app has drawn to a close. Anyone following the industry would’ve seen the writing on the wall when the app got taken over by Branch Metrics a while back. All that to say that updates and future compatibility remain unlikely. And if you haven’t been keeping up with alternate launchers for a while now — I know I haven’t — well, it’s time to start planning for what comes next. The good news is that Android’s launcher scene has grown rich and varied, and I’ve spent time testing and revisiting a wide range of options that will appeal to you not only if you’re looking for a Nova alternative, but also if you want to try something fresh. These are seven of my favorite Nova Launcher alternatives that stand out right now.",

As for the validity of this emulator, the Eden team has now confirmed on Discord that the Play Store listing is “legitimate, and fully owned and published by us.” However, it contains an older version of the app, with the latest v0.0.3 update from last Friday awaiting approval from Google.",

I see that new front-facing camera, and I know many Android brands are now scrambling to copy it in 2026; it’ll easily be the new gold standard of selfie cameras. But if there was one thing that stood out to me more than the silly thinness of the Air and its external battery pack, the misleading “fusion” lens, the 120Hz refresh rate on the base iPhone, and the new modems and chips, it’s one tiny detail: The iPhone 17 now starts at 256GB .",

These bulletins detail the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in that month’s security release, with issues ranging from low to critical in severity. Given how large and complex the Android operating system and its underlying components are, it’s not unusual to see a dozen or more vulnerabilities documented in a bulletin. However, the July 2025 bulletin broke this decade-long trend: out of the 120 bulletins published up to that point, it was the first ever to not list a single vulnerability. In contrast, the latest September 2025 bulletin listed a whopping 119 vulnerabilities. This disparity doesn’t mean Google had nothing to disclose in July; rather, it reflects strategic changes the company made to its Android security update process. These changes aim to help device manufacturers (OEMs) address high-risk issues more quickly and better protect users from active exploitation. Here’s what’s changing.",

Even an old, slow USB-C charger with no special features will do the trick, probably topping up at around 18W. That’s all you need to know if you’re OK with your phone taking up a couple of hours to charge. But if you want fast charging, you should buckle up. The world of USB-C is as messy as it is simple , and although one uniform port does the job, there are dozens of different speeds, protocols, and capabilities hidden in it — some prevalent, others uncommon. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of those special cases; it requires a specific flavor of USB-C fast charging that not every wall charger will offer, and finding the right one can be frustrating.",

    "body": "The Sun blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament over a three-hour period on Feb. 24, 2015. Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun, it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth. NASA The NASA-ESA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft captured this extreme ultraviolet wavelength image of the Sun on Feb. 24, 2015, during a three-hour period in which our closest star blew out a coronal mass ejection along with part of a solar filament. While some of the strands fell back into the Sun, a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles. Launched in December 1995, the joint NASA-ESA SOHO mission, was designed to study the Sun inside out. Though its mission was scheduled to run until only 1998, it has continued collecting data, adding to scientists&#8217; understanding of our closest star, and making many new discoveries , including more than 5,000 comets. NASA continues to study the Sun with various spacecraft. Soon, there will be three new ways to study the Sun’s influence across the solar system with the launch of a trio of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spacecraft.

Fixes like force-stopping the app or clearing its data work briefly before issues return, often after a reboot. Google has acknowledged the issue and is currently working on a solution. Google has a fair few things in the pipeline for Google Home. Gemini is coming to Google Home in October, and a new Gemini-powered Nest speaker , new Nest doorbells, and Nest cameras are in the works. Google is even previewing controls for more smart devices in the Home web app. However, not all is well with the platform and Google’s latest phones, as Pixel 10 users have complained about missing Google Home notifications on their devices. Thankfully, Google has confirmed it’s working on a solution. Reddit user GreyFoxSolid said they weren’t receiving Google Home notifications on their new Pixel 10 Pro XL. Several others also reported the same issue, with some users getting notifications on their Pixel Watch but not their phone.",

Google Photos is great for photo editing and media management, but it’s also pretty good for sharing photos with others. There is one caveat, though: You cannot search for anything in the images that others share with you, at least from what we can gather. Users have suggested that you need to save shared photos to your account first to be able to search for them, which isn’t very apparent to most users. Google has been working to fix that by directly opening up the ability to search for photos from albums shared with you on Google Photos.

While all of that is technically true, so is the fact that the Pixel 10 Pro is my new favorite Android phone. While it may not have a flashy new design or record-setting benchmarks, the day-to-day experience of using the Pixel 10 Pro is one that I can’t get enough of. Whether it’s the compact design, magnetic charging, versatile cameras, or unmatched software, there’s so much to like about this phone.",

Instead of using colors from your phone’s wallpaper, Android Auto’s media player could use the album art as the background once again. However, while testing this reversal, Google appears to have messed up another visual aspect in Android Auto. Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance . However, Google now appears to be testing a return to the older design. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

And we’re not talking performance, either, like how high you can get those benchmark figures, but electrical power: how much charge your phone holds, and how quick and easy it is to get it recharged. Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones. Samsung’s admittedly doing a lot of things right when it comes to batteries, and we continue to see Galaxy phones outdo the competition in terms of their ability to endure extended charging cycles . But there are still plenty of other power issues we’d like to see improved, and rumors have already suggested a few places whe…",

Samsung teamed up with Google for its Project Moohan headset on the brand-new Android XR platform. Samsung is said to be gearing up to launch the headset very soon , either by the end of this month or the next, depending on which leak you believe. Samsung has now accidentally disclosed that the Project Moohan headset will be called “Galaxy XR,” and that users will be shoot spatial images and videos on their phones to view it on the headset, just like they can on newer iPhones and the Apple Vision Pro.

This isn’t the first attempt. We’ve seen brands shove heart rate sensors into shoppers’ ears before, and by all means, shoot your shot. Sure, I’d be fairly weirded out if someone took my pulse in my earlobe, but earbuds with built-in sensors sound futuristic, and frankly, convenient. Unfortunately, they’re not about to dethrone your smartwatch for dedicated workout tracking. On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish. Relying on an earbud to collect your data is like asking a toddler to take your photo; you’ll get something, but it will probably be blurry, crooked, or missing half your head. In this case, you’ll likely have missing stats, shaky data, and dropouts.

PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced.

While its rivals often advertise free phones with no trade-in required, AT&amp;T rarely offers devices entirely free up front. That can make it less appealing to switchers, but the trade-off is that existing customers typically get the same deals as new ones. The main caveat is that upgrade offers usually require a higher-end plan, whereas new customers can often qualify with even a base unlimited plan. This applies to every deal listed below, unless otherwise noted.",

The “Created by you” section stores all Gemini-generated images, videos, and even deep research documents and code. ChatGPT has a similar feature, called Library, which makes it easier to find media created by it rather than sifting through chat history. Image generation has long been one of the most compelling and entertaining use cases for AI. The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana . However, searching through hundreds or even thousands of creations from individual Gemini chats can be tedious, which is why Google is now testing a dedicated space for all these creations — just like ChatGPT’s library.

All models have a nifty square selfie camera, there’s a super-slim iPhone Air (if you care about a slim and light design), and Pro models get a 48MP 4x camera with 8x lossless zoom. However, Samsung has inevitably criticized Apple’s launch event on Twitter , calling it a “Zzz-note.” The company posted the tweet as part of a competition announcement, where it promises to give away a Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. US Twitter users can enter by responding to the post and telling Samsung why they want to switch to Galaxy devices.",

Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles.

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon is supposedly working on two pairs of AR glasses. A larger, monochrome model could assist its delivery drivers and may debut in the first half of next year. The more compact, color-screen consumer glasses might not arrive until 2027. Amazon’s track record with tech hardware is a bit mixed, to put it lightly. We’ve seen some epic failures over the years, like the disaster that was the Fire Phone, and while its Echo smart speakers have been market leaders, it’s still very unclear if Alexa Plus is going to give all those smart home devices the boost they need to remain competitive. Today we’re hearing about some ambitious plans to expand its hardware lineup, with a report outlining the company’s goals for two new AR solutions. Right now, it feels like all the tech heavyweights are making serious investments in AR/XR hardware, with everyone from Meta to Google working on their own projects. Last year, we heard that Amazon could be building an AR pair of its own , though one that would be focused on assisting its delivery drivers. In a new report, The Information says those plans are still on track, and will also be joined by a consumer-oriented pair of AR glasses.",

Samsung launched the slim Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, and now Apple has launched the slightly slimmer iPhone Air . We’ve even seen this war extend to foldable phones in 2025. Apple claims the iPhone Air is just 5.6mm thin. However, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge and most other phones, this measurement doesn’t include the camera bump. You only need to look at the picture above to realize that it has a sizeable camera bump. In fact, it might be larger than the S25 Edge’s camera housing.",

The device is expected to feature a 6.3-inch display and an updated camera bump similar to the Z Fold 7. The new leak also reveals dimensions and display size, though there are some discrepancies with previously leaked dimensions. With practically all current-generation flagships already launched, it’s time to look forward to what’s coming to us in the next generation. We’ve already seen leaked renders for the Galaxy S26 Edge , followed by renders of the Galaxy S26 Pro and Galaxy S26 Ultra , albeit from a different leaker. Thanks to new leaked renders, we’re now getting a second look at the Galaxy S26 Pro. Android Headlines and OnLeaks have shared CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 Pro, a phone that is expected to succeed the Galaxy S25.",

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Google has relaunched the Pixel Referral Program for the Pixel 10 series, giving users 10 codes to share. A referral code provides a 10% discount on a new Pixel phone for the buyer and gives the referrer a $50 store credit. The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",
