It maybe also doesn't hurt that getting to know this guy post-mortem can get you kitted out with his sick armor and custom rifle ⁠—Bethesda even made a limited run of statues of the character . Scattered throughout New Vegas' Honest Hearts expansion, Clark's journals are an autobiographical account of the bombs falling and his experiences (and eventual death) in the world that followed. It includes the loss of his family, his adventures as a solo survivalist, and run-ins with various others, like a group of children that he becomes caretaker for in his old age, unwittingly laying the groundwork for a new tribal culture you meet in the present day, the Sorrows. For New Vegas lead writer John Gonzalez, it was one of the only things he wrote for the RPG's lauded series of DLCs before leaving Obsidian in March 2011 to work on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that my online ramblings about my love for the series resulted in my social media feeds being filled with Katamari-related content, yet one TikTok in particular stopped me in my tracks: The King of All Cosmos by Cybertsu . There's nothing more impressive to me than when someone decides to cosplay a somewhat unconventional character, because you can just tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into bringing their outfit and persona to life. While The King of All Cosmos does have some vaguely human features, it's by no means easy to pull off. Though saying that, I have definitely seen more cosplays of the Prince than I ever have of the King.

And he's not an easy person to please when it comes to gaming monitors, especially those with actually relatively low resolutions and pixel density figures. After all, the new MSI display is a 34-inch ultrawide with a 3440 × 1440 native resolution and therefore a 110 ppi density metric.

Well, there's good reason to think that it might just be a goer. Because this new MSI monitor rocks Samsung's very latest QD-OLED panel technology . MSI is referring to it as \"5th-Gen\" Samsung QD-OLED, which is news to me. I thought the very latest panel tech from Samsung is Gen 4. Likewise, MSI refers to not only \"5th Gen\" but \"5th Gen Tandem OLED\" when describing this panel technology, which leaves me a bit baffled. \"Tandem OLED\" has hitherto been a marketing pitch employed by LG, Samsung's main competitor in the OLED panel manufacturing industry, to describe its own latest WOLED technology. Has someone in MSI marketing department gotten a little over excited when it comes to both the 5th-Gen and the tandem thing? Very possibly.

You play through a domestic scene at home and then walk through the night to the village where all the monster-murder finally kicks in. They're characterful ways to begin a horror game, though they do put you off replays given all that slow-paced atmosphere-building only really works once. Resident Evil 4's remake would have had one of these intros, a Chapter 0 where you play Ashley in the moments leading up to her capture. You can see moments from it in the trailer, but it was cut at some point in development—perhaps due to complaints about how similar prologues messed with the pacing of other Residents Evil. (Capcom seems averse to giving players the option to skip stuff in replays, which you'd think would be an easy fix to the problem.) Thanks to modder and YouTuber Michael Kemp, we can see what this mini Episode Ashley would have looked like. Well, sort of. The leftovers found among RE4R's files don't include the cutscenes, the enemies, or whatever Ashley would have used to light her way through the dark, though they do include a couple of differ…",

As lead writer John Gonzalez told PC Gamer in an interview with associate editor Ted Litchfield, that's all by design: \"I remember when we were just kicking off the project, [New Vegas lead Josh Sawyer] coming into a conference room and saying, 'Okay, so we're not doing any good or evil, black and white stuff. We're doing everything in shades of gray. It's going to be moral ambiguity and complexity.'\" But another mandate from Sawyer required that the player also have utmost agency: \"The player has to be able to get through this game killing everyone they meet the moment they meet them, and also killing absolutely nothing at all,\" Gonzalez recalled. That's where Yes Man came in. If you haven't played New Vegas, Yes Man is a robot sporting a goofy grin and an inability to decline any command or truly be disposed of.

I'm not a huge fan art guy, but Deimos' work speaks to me—it reimagines this classic game through the lens of fine art, a style that emulates romantic painting, but applied to the side stories and characters of a 2010 RPG. 2281 Overture feels like a particularly illustrative example, showing an NCR-aligned version of the game's final battle with every companion ringed around the Courier (something you can't pull off in an unmodded game).

When you don't invest in gameplay, you don't just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.\" Hytale was \"barely playable\" when he reassumed control, Collins-Laflamme said, and all the game's basic systems were broken: \"Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering.

Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 people on July 2, 2025, many of them from its Xbox division—a massacre made even more grotesque by the words of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who said as the axe fell that the company's gaming business had \"never looked stronger,\" The cuts also included multiple cancellations including the Perfect Dark reboot (and the closure of the studio making it), Rare's Everwild project, and an unannounced MMO in development at ZeniMax, codenamed Blackbird. Happy New Year everyone. I’ve been pretty quiet the last six months, but I posted this message on LinkedIn late yesterday just to give everyone an update.

To my elation, 2026 is starting with a delightful surprise: a major update to Baba Is You with all sorts of new words, objects and modding tools. The update is detailed in a Steam community blog post , which reasons \"This will most probably be the final large update for BIY.\" It seems to be primarily targeted at modders, but contains five new words for use in custom levels: become, facedby, hold, happy, and angry. If you've never played Baba is You, words change the way a given level works as you construct condition-altering sentences. For instance, Baba is Happy would theoretically make the player character happy… what effect that would have on a puzzle, I'm not sure. There's also a bunch of new sprites, including a fox, a bean, a hot dog, a cactus, and so on.

Seehorn is best known for starring alongside Bob Odenkirk in Better Call Saul, but her work stretches back into the '90s. As it turns out, one of her earliest live action roles was in, of all things, a Magic: The Gathering game by Microprose. It is as hilarious, blurry, and gloriously low-budget as you'd hope. All the hallmarks of cheesy '90s PC game fantasy are on proud display here, with the actors superimposed over primitive CG backgrounds. The full tutorial appears to contain well over an hour of dictated instruction and probably isn't the best way to learn a notoriously complex card game (especially since this is nearly 30 years old), but it's admirably committed to the bit.

But he's also flirted with a bit of gaming-minded philanthropy, publicly musing about whether he'd save the Minecraft-like Hytale before it was sold back to its original owners; and today, the open-source C# framework MonoGame announced it received a sizable donation from Barone that kicks off a long-term relationship. MonoGame announced in a post on X that Barone \"has made a very generous initial donation of $125,000 and an ongoing monthly commitment to the project. This extraordinary show of support, alongside ongoing contributions from other studios and individuals, helps ensure MonoGame continues to be the open-source C# framework that game developers of all sizes can rely on.\" While Stardew Valley wasn't initially built using MonoGame—it switched to the framework from XNA in 2021 —it has been used to make all sorts of indie hits. You can find a list of games that utilize the framework on its website , ranging from reverse-horror game Carrion to Celeste to cutesy RTS Tooth and Tail . I can't speak to the…",

There's no release window yet, but a recent Kickstarter update dropped on Dec. 28 alongside a new trailer that had me perplexed at first and sold about 15 seconds in. It just shows off the game's \"game over\" screen, which sounds like the sort of thing that wouldn't be all that noteworthy, but the song slaps . Funky synth bass and warped, echoing samples glide over hip hop drums; it's the sort of dance-worthy defeat screen that salves the sting of losing in a frenzied arcade game. And if you haven't given Mindwave's demo a shot, that's exactly what it is. PC Gamer's Elie Gould sang the demo's praises in their impressions piece on it, and I similarly came away from it foaming at the mouth to play the full game. It's a chaotic mishmash of what WarioWare originally coined as \"micro-games\": dead simple minigames that you have mere seconds to complete, played one after another at mach speeds. It differentiates itself from the Nintendo series by being a bit more narrative; the Steam page bills it as \"…",

The news came in a Steam Community Hub update that reads: \"Due to the expiration of a licensing agreement, this game will be removed from sale on Steam. The delisting process is currently underway. If you already own the game, nothing changes—it will remain available in your Steam library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.\" Though not as popular as colorful spinoff River City Girls , the game sits at a \"mostly positive\" user review rating on Steam . I haven't played Underground myself just yet, but I have played the original NES game; it's one of the better action games on the system that I've tried.

Not only that, but each game in the collection has been updated so a cross-platform co-op game between a Steam user and an Epic Games Store user is a little less finicky. Now, when you boot up Trine 1 through 4 on Steam, you'll be prompted to optionally link your Steam and Epic accounts for cross-platform friend invites and achievement progress. The series' headlining feature is its three-player co-op, so this should make playing with anyone who just got the games due to this promotion easier. If you haven't played Trine, it's a The Lost Vikings-style puzzle platformer with three characters: a bumbling but burly knight, a thief with grappling hooks and a bow, and a wizard who can generate cubes and platformers. In solo play, you can only control one character at a time, but in multiplayer, all three characters are on screen at once. It gets chaotic quickly, but that's the fun bit; the puzzles are good, but rarely major head scratchers. They were decently popular on Steam when they first hit…",

It seems like players are eager to embrace the new order, as two decidedly chill games dominated the sales charts around Christmas: Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6. That stat comes courtesy of SteamDB , which gathered a list of the top ten best-selling games (excluding free-to-play games) from December 23 to today, December 30. There are plenty of familiar faces: the award-guzzling Clair Obscur, the absurdly excellent Baldur's Gate 3, and our favorite game of 2025, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. There's also some games that you just take for granted as always being best sellers: Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and the latest EA Sports FC, for example. But at the very top split only by the Steam Deck are Arc Raiders and Battlefield 6, two shooters that offer relatively intense, competitive styles of shooter (extraction and modern military) without all the sweat.
