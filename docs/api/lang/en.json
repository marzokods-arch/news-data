The phone features a Dimensity 6300 chip, stereo speakers, and support for Dolby Atmos. Buying a budget phone often means making trade-offs. You might get a great screen but a weak battery, or a sturdy phone that takes poor photos. For the past few years, Motorola has tried to solve this problem with its G Power series, and now it looks like the company is making another strong attempt. Motorola has announced the Moto G Power 2026, and while it looks familiar, there are some key changes under the hood that might make it the sub-$300 phone to beat in 2026.",

We first spotted the Nano Banana-powered image editing tool in a beta last month , and it has since rolled out more widely. While the idea of remixing photos directly inside chats is novel, many people were far less impressed by how Google chose to surface it. The large Remix button, which sits directly on top of images in several parts of the app, has quickly drawn criticism online , with users complaining that it distracts from viewing photos, interferes with zoom gestures, and can’t be turned off.

Coach Niall Horan praised the performance in the moment, telling his finalist he was “so, so proud” and urging America to vote following what he called an “absolutely incredible” showing. Earlier in the night, Ross opened his finals run with JVKE’s “Golden Hour,” earning another enthusiastic response from Horan, who said the singer consistently finds “the heartbeat” of every song he performs.

However, this occurrence of El Niño ’s cooler counterpart is relatively weak, and its influence on weather and climate over the next several months remains to be seen. Part of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, La Niña develops when strengthened easterly trade winds intensify the upwelling of cold, deep water in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

The experiment sees users make plain-language requests about the type of content they want to see. You can sign up for the latest experiment in Search Labs now. Google gives the option to try a bunch of developing search-related features early in Search Labs. This weekend, a Reddit user spotted a new Labs feature that purportedly lets you tweak the content on your Discover feed to your liking — using AI, of course. User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing. You can even use it to have Discover pick up or exclude content from specific sources.",

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average.

As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

    "body": "Lee esta nota de prensa en español aquí . Our universe is filled with galaxies, in all directions as far as our instruments can see. Some researchers estimate that there are as many as two trillion galaxies in the observable universe. At first glance, these galaxies might appear to be randomly scattered across space, but they’re not. Careful mapping has shown that they are distributed across the surfaces of giant cosmic “bubbles” up to several hundred million light-years across. Inside these bubbles, few galaxies are found, so those regions are called cosmic voids. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow us to measure these voids with new precision, which can tell us about the history of the universe’s expansion.

The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co.

That’s when farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and other states burn off plant “stubble” after the rice harvest. When winds are weak and the atmosphere becomes stagnant, the haze can push levels of air pollution several times higher than limits recommended by the World Health Organization . Smoke typically mixes with particles and gases from other sources, such as industry, vehicles, domestic fires (heating and cooking), fireworks, and dust storms, to form the haze, though scientists consider stubble burning to be a major factor.

The feature is reportedly being tested only in one country for now. Waze users have been wanting the traffic light support for years, and the company confirmed in May that it is indeed a planned feature. After years of user requests, Waze seems to be finally testing support for traffic lights on its navigation maps. It’s a small but meaningful update for the crowdsourced navigation app that has long focused on real-time driving conditions, and one that Google Maps has already offered since 2022.",

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Now, though, things are different. Android tablets are better than ever, and they come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from just larger than a foldable phone to nearly rivaling full-sized laptops.

The changes deliver new playback controls and move a lot of info around, so it may take a little to get used to. With 2025 starting to wind down, a lot of us have been looking back on everything that’s happened this year. It’s definitely been a busy one, filled with not just plenty of major launches, but also a bunch of noteworthy anniversaries — like YouTube turning 20 years old . Back when it was celebrating that milestone, the site shared a number of upcoming changes that we’d soon see arrive. One it teased at the time was a new viewing experience for YouTube on TVs, and this week we get word that this update is now widely available. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

The recently ejected material is spat out in opposite directions with immense speed — the gas shown in yellow is moving close to a million kilometers an hour.

Even more so, foldables offer a special benefit for photography. You can fold them mid-way and prop them up on a flat surface, engage the external screen for a preview, and use the rear cameras for selfies. Even when you’re looking at the inner screen, you can use half of the screen as a viewfinder for the camera and the other half to review shots you just took. Many foldables, including the wide range of Galaxy Z Folds , Vivo X Folds , and even the OnePlus Open , already support the feature.
