    "body": "Blizzard recently opened the gates on a renewed version of an old World of Warcraft expansion, giving players the opportunity to blast through familiar quests and dungeons with way more power than they had back in 2016. For many players, WoW Legion Remix is an opportunity to collect achievements and cosmetics they previously missed—or the new ones Blizzard added on top. Many of them require completing raids and dungeons that take full groups, but finding parties has proven to be a problem in the early stage of the event. Weirdly enough, players are running into completely the opposite problem you'd expect if this was the regular version of WoW: Tanks, out of all three available roles, are the overwhelming majority. That's because, as you gain more and more gear upgrades, characters dedicated to healing or pure damage-dealing aren't really needed. Unfortunately, this leaves behind all the players who haven't had the time to grind themselves into godhood. Reddit user Fjoes posted a screenshot of several groups, made up purely of tanks, waiting for a healer or damage dealer to fill the empty slots. It's a full-on tank meta and the gap will probably get worse as the average power leve…",

The game's community is so enthusiastic that modders are practically making entire games in the snowiest slice of Tamriel, and there's no sign they'll slow down any time soon. It's something that leaves Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith \"eternally shocked,\" as he told FRVR : \"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, ten. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?\" Speaking on the FRVR Podcast, Nesmith shared that Todd Howard would roll out the concurrent player numbers every now and again, to which Nesmith could only respond \"'You've got to be kidding me? Seriously, ten years later.'\" You'll never find a consensus on which Elder Scrolls game is the best—I go back and forth on it all the time, myself—but it's no secret which is the most popular and broadly accessible.

Arrowhead dropped a new video today that covers how future updates will roll out.

A peek at the top demos page on Steam reveals what has the most players interested from the jump. Right at the top is the Heroes of Might and Magic prequel, Olden Era , which has spent the last few days accruing a Mostly Positive user rating on the platform. Just below it is Half Sword , a bloody physics-based medieval combat simulator whose demo has already been popular for a while. The two could make for a nice double feature if you want to run the gamut from high fantasy to mundane, macabre reality. Runners up from there include voxel-based, ship-crewing survival game Everwind , an extraction shooter called The Cube, Save Us , and a silly multiplayer wizarding game about voice chat-powered spell incantations called Yapyap .

As Cain puts it: \"Nobody should be walking around the Wasteland going, 'Hey did you know they dropped nukes eighty years ago?' Yes! Everybody knows that!\" To be explicit, this is not canon. \"This is stuff that was true in the first game but there's no design document,\" says Cain. \"Bethesda is canon.

In an exclusive PC Gamer interview, senior game director Ion Hazzikostas says that over the years, the game has gotten increasingly complex. He goes on to explain upcoming changes to encounter and class design. \"If you're playing it out of the box, no addons whatsoever, and trying to play at the highest competitive levels, I do think that it is too hard,\" he says, \"and I think that consequently, hardly anyone is attempting to do that.\" Midnight aims to change that dynamic. Initially the team focused on trying to limit the impact of combat-related mods, but soon realized it wasn't feasible to carve away bits of their functions.

It's theoretically infinite, though I'm sure there's a practical level 'cap' most won't want to grind past eventually. With that said, there is an endpoint in terms of progression and tangible rewards. At every level from Rank 2-50, you'll unlock guns and other gear to equip in loadouts, as well as the occasional cosmetic item. Once you reach Rank 50, you'll enter what's called mastery or advanced Ranks. Every two levels from Rank 52-100, you'll unlock new cosmetic item…",

Yesssss. This is the Star Trek-level technology I was promised as a child. Well, maybe that's jumping the gun a bit. Still, the achievement here is incredibly impressive (via Tom's Hardware ). Essentially, the researcher's new Atom2chip process allowed them to flow a layer of molybdenum disulphide , functioning as a memory array, on top of a 0.13 micrometre CMOS silicon chip—fusing together an emerging atomic-scale, \"2D\" technology with traditional methods to create a working hybrid memory chip. The chip-riding 2D flash memory array is able to communicate with the CMOS chip's control logic via a custom interface, which in turn means that instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism and random access instructions can be swapped between the two. And the deeper you go, the more impressive the scale of the achievement becomes. While wafers are polished…",

However, high bloom (random bullet deviation causing shots to not land where you're actually aiming), especially on assault rifles (looking at you, M433 ), has resulted in the very strange situation where SMGs are actually more effective than ARs at medium range. One of the prime examples of this is the PW7A2 —one of my favourite weapons so far, thanks to incredible accuracy at range on top of already strong TTK and handling. Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg, as I've just got my hands on the SCW-10 SMG. You'll need to complete the Close Quarters 1 assignment to unlock the SCW-10, which requires you to get 300 close-quarter kills with SMGs and inflict 10,000 damage while aiming with SMGs. Thankfully, this isn't as bad as most other assignments. Now, I'll admit, the SCW-10 might be the worst-looking gun at first sight, owing in large part to its very small frame, low precision stat, and measly 15 bullets in a magazine. The thing is, these don't matter once you've actually seen the gun in action. Boasting higher than average …",

There's nothing more thrilling than wearing down a big health bar and barely squeezing out a victory because everyone was able to maximize their role in the fight. And that's just the boss fights. There are tons of strategies for how to work through the packs of enemies efficiently that you'll need to adapt to as the challenge increases.

What looks to be a slim and sleek SFF chassis housing a CPU cooler, AIO radiator, and some unrecognisable graphics card is actually a desktop Bluetooth speaker. Because... well, I'm still not sure. Are we now living in an era where the gaming PC aesthetic is somehow aspirational? I suppose that might account for it. After all, a modern gaming desktop can be a very expensive thing, and a quick look at the Battlestations subreddit reveals a huge number of users anxious to show off their pricey, RGB-lit setups to the world. So, aspirational = luxury, luxury = home decor. It's also a good opportunity to do an Xzibit and put a gaming PC on your gamin…",

But what was certain was that a large chunk of the VRMs were now missing, which meant power could no longer reach the chip itself (via Videocardz ). However, YouTuber Paulo Gomes took it upon themselves to see what they could do for the stricken graphics card, and arrived at an unusual solution: wiring in the VRMs still attached to an AMD Radeon RX 580 donor card to provide electrical assistance to the fallen RTX 5070 Ti . And holy hell, it appears to have worked. The AMD card was rigged with a series of electrical wires to bypass the missing VRMs, and was left riding piggyback aboard its much-more-powerful competitor. There's something uncomfortably medical about the whole affair, what with the sequence of wires resembling hospital tubes—but lo and behold, the RTX 5070 Ti now provides an output signal once more.

That's \"a global cosmetic mod to ensure the most comfortable Serious Sam 2 experience possible\", that does things like rework the interface to be closer to the Serious Sam Xbox version, tweak weapon visuals, and make \"enemies gib in a much more satisfying way\".

The protagonist—Katja—had to make her way to a location, bypassing hordes of violent cultists to find the one person she cares about in this deteriorating world. (Image credit: Blumhouse Games) This was a stealth mission: Katja is navigating through broken apartments via rickety impromptu bridges, holes in walls, and decrepit elevators, all while making pit stops at almost every source of cover there is—that may just be my way of playing. The cultists don't have a particularly harsh line-of-sight—perhaps that's thanks to their ill-fitting gas masks—so if you're careful, keeping to the shadows and making use of all the cover there is, you can weave your way through them without many issues.

One of the surprising aspects of the original Lofree Flow—considering how little-known the brand was at the time—was its undeniably high-quality construction. The good news is that you still get that premium feel and attention to detail in the Lofree Flow 2. If anything, it's been stepped up a notch. First, though, you'll need to choose from three size options: 100 keys (96%), 84 keys (75%), or 68 keys (65%). We reviewed the 84-key version, and it provides a comfortable balance of functionality and portability.

    "body": "With each iteration, Razer seems to take its Wolverine gaming controller to new heights. The V2 Pro was a step up over the original, while the V3 Pro repeated the trick, ending up as one of the best PC controllers money can buy. Now Razer has found a way to improve on near-perfection with the wordily named Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC . If you've got the cash for it as a PC gamer, it should be top of your list. Let's start with the build, which is sturdy and solid all over. The edge of each hand grip is coated in a dimpled, textured surface that helps it stay firmly lodged in the palm of even the sweatiest neckbeard. The durable construction should last you years of gaming, but Razer has included a robust carrying case in the box, just in case. To top it off, the controller's weight has been significantly reduced compared to the previous Wolverine V3 Pro, and it now sits at 220g, down from 304g—a 28% reduction. If you enjoy your fair share of marathon gaming sessions, you're not going to feel weighed down here. Almost every element of the Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC is decked out in a matte black finish, with a few gloss highlights thrown in for good measure. It feels classy in an understate…",

    "body": "For more than 20 years , ASRock has been churning out motherboards for just about every possible PC user and scenario. They were all very barebones and functional, though, and it wasn't until 2010 that it specifically targeted the gaming sector, with a collaboration with esports player Fatal1ty. Fast forward to 2019, and ASRock broadened its gaming appeal with the first of its Phantom Gaming series of motherboards. These were designed \"closely with partners to fine-tune the products, and to ensure every product can deliver outstanding gaming experience.\" Well, I can say now that one of its most recent Phantom Gaming offerings, the X870 Nova WiFi is neither fine-tuned nor delivers anything like an outstanding gaming experience. Don't get me wrong: it's not a bad motherboard. It's just that it's hampered by a number of compromises, middling performance, and a price tag that's a touch too high in today's competitive market.

The endgame loop in Path of Exile 2 basically involves running maps and defeating bosses. Each map can have additional difficulty modifiers crafted onto it to increase the potential rewards. Some of those mods can be brutal, like bonus health to all monsters or full immunity to certain types of elemental damage. The point of the system is to pick and choose which mods your character can handle. But it also means you can create maps that are so nasty that even the best players can't survive. That's the idea with XTheFarmerX's Boss Bash Bonanza , except the only goal is to defeat the shark boss that has trillions of extra health and damage, and a t…",

After working on some RPGs at Squaresoft early in his career, Kimura satirized the genre by having you go around healing monsters with kindness instead of killing them. Fox's love for Moon helped convince Kimura to get it translated and released on Steam and Switch after two decades. (Image credit: tobyfox) Their friendship, I realized within a few minutes of talking with Kimura in Tokyo last month, also makes him careful to avoid piggybacking off of Undertale's popularity even if he'd have a good case for doing so. \"The most important thing for me when talking about Toby Fox in public is that I really like him, and because I really like him and respect him.

That number comes from SteamDB , which shows Battlefield 6 jockeying with Dota 2 for second most-played game on Steam right now behind the platform's perennial #1, Counter-Strike 2. The number has been left to simmer for a bit as I write this on a Sunday morning, but sits proudly at around 600,000 active players regardless. With a bit more oomph as the game builds up steam, it might just overtake Baldur's Gate 3's historical peak of 875,000 simultaneous players, which would put it very close to the all-time top ten . Still, it's overtaken the likes of Marvel Rivals, Apex Legends, and notably, any Call of Duty game on the platform, so even if it plateaus from here it is a seismic release.

As we edge closer to the May 26, 2026 launch date, excitement for a third trailer is growing, but with a far from orthodox road to release thus far—one that's included leaks, court cases and \"indefinite\" secure hospital sentences , to name but some of its twists and turns—is a third pre-launch outing a given at all? Your guess, quite frankly, is as good as ours.

So, when Bramble: The Mountain King, an action adventure horror game inspired by Nordic folklore, was released in 2023 it's no surprise that my entire personality became based around this game for a good few months after playing. Welcome to Soundtrack Sunday, where a member of the PC Gamer team takes a look at a soundtrack from one of their favourite games—or a broader look at videogame music as a whole—offering a little backstory and recommendations for tracks you should be adding to your playlist. But as much as I adored the world Bramble: The Mountain King built, alongside the beasts both big and small that inhabited it, my obsession with the game wasn't just restricted to playing it. It didn't take long, but its soundtrack became my go-to for things like working, commuting, or whenever I wasn't sure what to put on. You might be sitting there wondering how the soundtrack of a horror game could become such a consistent fallback for me. After all, aren't they designed to induce fear? The answer is a mix of b…",

At the end of this month developer Northplay is running a closed alpha playtest, and you can sign up to test its tyrannosaurs right now. In a Steam post , Northplay explained the closed alpha will comprise a \"small slice\" of Dinolords, though to my eye it looks like a sizeable slab of stegosaur steak. The closed alpha will let players get hands-on with a three-part tutorial, after which they'll be able to explore four distinct maps, two different game modes, and a \"'campaign' setup with cross-level progression.\" That's enough to give Fred Flintstone indigestion. All of this will let players experiment with Dinolords' core systems, which includes typical RTS mechanics like basebuilding and unit control, as well as the more ARPG-inspired combat.

Created by modder WilliamGee, Horror Castle is a sizeable affair. Its nine-level campaign sees Duke explore not one but several gothic fortresses, offering between 3-5 hours of additional FPS fun. It isn't just a level pack either. Horror Castle introduces 24 new enemies including wandering skeletons, vampire bats, and Nosferatu-like bloodsuckers, as well as four minibosses from D3D with the added bonus of being able to shrink them and stomp them to death. Horror Castle also equips Duke with four additional weapons. Duke can toss enormous spiders to attack enemies, then blast them with skeletal shrapnel using the Bone Crusher, a weapon reminiscent of the Ravager from Doom: The Dark Ages . And rather than replenishing health using medkits, Duke can boost his vitality by cracking open discarded skulls and feasting on the soft and squishy sponge w…",

Up until this week, 9 Kings only had eight kings available to play as, using their unique decks to construct your base and fend off enemy forces. Talk about an embarrassing oversight! If I were making a game called 9 Kings, I would ensure it had the requisite number of monarchs befitting its title from the start! Fortunately, as of its most recent update, 9 Kings finally lives up to its name.

The update comes direct from ToeJam and Earl co-creator Greg Johnson, who took to Reddit recently for an AMA .

Johnson's response was brief, but candid. \"I can say that a new game is in the planning stage. We intend to make it happen,\" he replied. Unlike 2019's Back in the Groove, this game won't be developed by Johnson's company HumaNature Studios, though some contributors to that project will be involved. \"It's going to be developed by a third party, [with] design led by the infamous and talented producer of BitG, Nap,\" Johnson elaborated.

Like Realms creator Ed Greenwood's Elminster, Salvatore's characters have gotten cameos in Baldur's Gate. Heroic cleric Cadderly pops in to say hi near the end of Baldur's Gate 1, while Salvatore's signature Drow Ranger and memetic Best Swordsman Ever, Drizzt Do'Urden, can be befriended or fought in both Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. According to Salvatore, making sure the action in his books hews close enough to the D&D rules of the day has been one of the job's more challenging demands. \"That's been one of the toughest parts,\" said Salvatore. \"4th Edition D&D almost broke me, not because I didn't like 4th edition D&D.

    "body": "It may not hit for infinite damage, but this new necromancer build in Diablo 4 has infinite bullets, and that's close enough. The whole build involves pressing a single button to fire off bone splinters in every direction. No enemy is safe from the barrage of projectiles that cover the entire screen and hit for billions of damage. Diablo YouTuber Rob2628 showcased the build—which was originally created by a Chinese player on Bilibili —in a recent video. Played optimally, the build can crush the hardest dungeons in the game and speed clear them in minutes. Anyone who has played necromancer before will know how impressive that is for what is normally the slowest class in the game. Technically, the build uses the basic skill Bone Splinters, but that's not the skill you'll be spamming every second. One of the legendary powers you can pick up causes Bone Spirit to launch a volley of Bone Splinters in all directions. You ignore Bone Spirit entirely and just use the skill to fire off hundreds of Bone Splinters. That alone will only tickle monsters, which is why you have to flip on one of season 10's new Chaos Perks, Unstable Power, that makes basic skills always deal massive damage with …",

    "body": "Members of the Gearbox team came to PAX Australia so Randy Pitchford could do some magic tricks we'll gloss over , and to reveal more about the post-launch plans for Borderlands 4. First up is a Halloween-themed \"seasonal mini-event\" called Horrors of Kairos that will run from October 23 to November 6, adding \"blood rain\" to world bosses, new legendary loot, and a pumpkin-head cosmetic for everyone available via Shift code . While that'll be a free addition, a paid add-on will follow with the first Bounty Pack: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day. Like the Headhunter Packs from Borderlands 2, the Bounty Packs will be small additions, with a chain of missions and a boss fight as well as a bunch of themed cosmetics and legendary gear. The story of this one has Rush, the buff lad who runs the Outlanders, trying to keep holiday traditions alive despite the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture, Screw, explicitly restricting seasonal jolliness and cheer. That'll be out on November 20. In December, a free update will add a new difficulty level for Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and an endgame challenge boss, harking back to Crawmerax the Invincible, the raid boss from the first game's Secret Armory of …",
