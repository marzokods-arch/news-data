    "body": "The Living Legends Foundation celebrated its 32 nd anniversary by bringing its annual awards gala to Atlanta for the first time Friday (Oct. 3). And among the honorees on hand were Grammy-winning songwriting/production duo Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, Otis Redding Foundation vp/executive director Karla Redding-Andrews (representing her mother, Zelma Redding), RCA Records head of promotion Samantha Selolwane, and Right On! Digital publisher Cynthia Horner. Upon accepting the foundation’s Ray Harris Lifetime Achievement Award onstage at Atlanta’s Flourish by Legendary, Jam shared that “Ray Harris was so instrumental early in our careers with literally the first record that we did at SOLAR Records, which was ‘Wild Girls’ by Klymaxx. So to get an award from him with his name on it is absolutely amazing.” Calling the occasion a full-circle moment, Lewis added, “We’re just two guys who like to make music. You all are the ones who made them hits.” The foundation also awarded three other top awards. National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB) president/CEO James L. Winston was presented with the Chairman’s Award by Living Legends Foundation chairman David C. Linton. Zelma Red…",

    "body": "Taylor Swift ’s The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift&#8217;s biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele’s 25 , which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2&nbsp;million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department , sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Luminate’s sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard ’s charts. All numbers in this story are for the U.S. only.
