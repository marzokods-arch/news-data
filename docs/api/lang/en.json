Any sign of dust bunnies or other undesirables on my floors, and I feel the need to press start on a bot. For as great as robot vacuums can be, they have limitations, and sometimes you need a more precise tool to get the job done. One such contender is the Dreame H15 Pro CarpetFlex (), a flagship wet-dry vacuum with a self-drive system, RGB sensors, purpose-built interchangeable rollers, and an intelligent dust-suppression system. I’ve tested it for a few weeks around my home to see how it performs.",

Whether I’m dropping my partner off at work, going on a long road trip, or nipping to the shop in a foreign town, Auto keeps me entertained, helps me communicate with loved ones, and aids navigation while driving. The experience isn’t flawless, though, especially when focusing on that latter use case. Google Maps is a mostly reliable and robust mapping application on Android, but its problems become apparent when used through Android Auto. Beyond its often questionable navigation suggestions, its UI frequently disrupts and distracts in an environment where information should be as legible as possible. This issue stems from Google’s reluctance to give drivers more UI control.",

This means your Snapdragon 8 Elite phone should see better performance and fewer bugs with the Switch emulator. This update also brings support for Windows on Arm devices as well as a variety of other optimizations and fixes. Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors. Its RGB laser light source is rated for approximately 25,000 hours, and the projector supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for dynamic range playback.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The next version of the image generator is said to use a multi-stage generation process to refine results before outputting a final image. It’s claimed that Nano Banana 2 will also offer native support for 2K rendering with upscaling to 4K. Last week, Google released a podcast episode in which it finally explained how its popular image generator, Nano Banana, got its quirky name. While the playful name helped with its rise to fame, it was the tool’s impressive results that made it go viral. Google is reportedly working on a second generation of the AI model, and a leak claims it could offer some significant improvements. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops.

Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept.

It replaces the older option for downloading images before sharing with the option to share pictures with public links. Whether that improves sharing or causes more friction is a matter of debate. Ever since its launch, Google’s Nano Banana has stirred up numerous viral trends for AI-generated images. And unless you’re at odds with AI and uphold that it cannot replace true art, you’re likely to have participated in some of these trends yourself. To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place. And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers.

Can you switch between the networks, or do you have to pick just one? If you’ve dealt with US Mobile in the past, you might be under the assumption that you have to pick just one network and stick with it, as that was somewhat true in the past, but thankfully not anymore. US Mobile does offer the ability to switch between carriers. In fact, there are two different methods available.",

The Galaxy S26 isn’t expected to launch until February, but leaks have continued to flow in at a steady pace. Earlier today, the Galaxy S26 Plus leaked in its iPhone 17 Pro-esque orange hue. Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",
