RingConn also promises longer battery life with the new smart ring. It’s more inclusive and stylish, expanding to 10 sizes for a better fit and offering five jewelry-like finishes. Smart rings have stayed pretty much the same for a while, so if yours still works, there hasn’t been a big reason to upgrade. That’s starting to change. At CES 2026 , RingConn is launching the Gen 3, which promises more than just a small update over Gen 2 . The RingConn Gen 3 still uses titanium but now comes in five colors and three finishes: Brushed Silver, Brushed Rose Gold, Polished Future Silver, Royal Gold, and a new Matte Black. Unlike Gen 2’s limited options, Gen 3 looks more like jewelry you’d want to wear.",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

The telephoto camera is expected to remain largely the same, though the periscope zoom could receive a wider aperture. These rumored changes follow years of criticism regarding Samsung’s minimal hardware evolution in its flagship imaging systems. Samsung’s flagships have undergone minimal hardware evolution over the years, particularly in the camera department. The upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to disappoint with the same camera hardware, and super early leaks for the Galaxy S27 Ultra also painted the same picture. However, a new leak suggests that Samsung might finally stop being so lazy and actually provide us with a camera upgrade in the Galaxy S27 Ultra.

The Clicks Communicator is a full-fledged Android smartphone, featuring an integrated physical keypad and a nearly square 4.03-inch OLED screen (1,080 x 1,200 pixels). Clicks explains that the phone can be used as a standalone device, but added that it was also designed for people who use two phones. In fact, the company says it envisions the Communicator as a communication-focused device (surprise) while your other phone is focused on entertainment and content capture.",

Using a self-developed OmniSense VLA model, the robot aims to adapt to various household tasks, such as folding clothes, among others. SwitchBot also revealed the Lock Vision series smart lock, the AI MindClip recorder, an E-Ink Weather Station, and the OBBOTO AI desk light. By conventional definition, smart home products excel at one task, and they do it expertly. However, there is also a need for more generalist products. SwitchBot tried to tap into this market with the multi-tasking Robot K20 Plus Pro last year — a vacuum that can do more than just vacuum. This year at CES , SwitchBot is going all in on generalist smart home products with an actual robot. Meet the onero H1, SwitchBot’s first humanoid robot.

The display combines built-in sensor data with local weather information, including indoor temperature and humidity, air quality, current conditions, and a six-day forecast. It also offers calendar syncing, smart home automations, and AI-powered weather briefings. This year at CES , SwitchBot is introducing a new, information-first display to its smart home lineup, and it’s the kind of device designed to save you from checking your phone (or forgetting your umbrella). The new SwitchBot Weather Station features a 7.5-inch E-Ink display that keeps key household and weather data visible at a glance, without the glare or distractions of a tablet-style screen. It’s meant to live on a counter or entry table, surfacing the information you want before heading out the door. As LCD smart displays continue creeping into more corners of the home, SwitchBot’s E-Ink Weather Station feels like a quieter alternative and a calmer way to keep tabs on your environment.",

XREAL is a big player in the burgeoning AR glasses space, and today, ahead of CES, the company’s announcing a “mid-generation refresh” for its XREAL One glasses from late 2024. The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",

The page reveals that Privacy Display will be located in the Settings app, in the Display section. An animation showing how the feature works was also spotted on the page. Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Located about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo (the Maiden), NGC 4388 is a resident of the Virgo galaxy cluster. This enormous cluster of galaxies contains more than a thousand members and is the nearest large galaxy cluster to the Milky Way.

This perspective reveals a curious feature that wasn’t visible in a&nbsp; previous Hubble image of this galaxy &nbsp;released in 2016: a plume of gas from the galaxy’s nucleus, here seen billowing out from the galaxy’s disk toward the lower-right corner of the image.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

Swiss phone maker Punkt is back at CES 2026 with a familiar message and a slightly more refined pitch. The company has unveiled the MC03, its latest privacy-focused smartphone, aimed at people who want more control over how their phone behaves and how much data it shares. All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

    "body": "Credit: Guest Post / Android Authority Google’s ecosystem has quietly become the backbone of my everyday workflow. From jotting down quick ideas in Google Keep to drafting articles in Docs or unwinding on YouTube, I rely on Google’s tools more than I sometimes realise. These apps follow me everywhere, slipping into my day-to-day routine without much thought — until I actually stopped and considered how much I depend on them. That moment came recently when I started thinking about moving away from Google’s services. It wasn’t because I disliked them; I was simply curious whether I could simplify my setup or reduce my reliance on one company. But as someone who reviews multiple smartphones every year — and constantly switches between iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac — it didn’t take long to realise that walking away from Google would make my workflow significantly more chaotic.",

Reading mode has been available in Chrome on Android for a while, but using it has never been particularly reliable.

Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Android gaming handheld launches have been feeling a little shaky lately, and the KONKR Pocket FIT is the latest example. Despite being announced ahead of its closest rival, the Pocket FIT Elite now won’t ship until after the Chinese New Year holiday, which in 2026 runs through early March. AYANEO confirmed the delay in a new Indiegogo update posted today. While shipments of the standard Pocket FIT G3 Gen 3 are still moving through January, the company says the Elite model has been pushed back due to “multiple recent supply chain disruptions,” with no firm shipping date beyond the Chinese New Year window.",

As color E Ink continues to try to escape the shadow of e-readers , the PicPak is the latest attempt to see where else the technology can go. The tiny E Ink display acts as a trendy, miniature digital picture frame you can fill up and forget about, thanks to extended battery life and storage for more than 500 images.

Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate. At the center, the device’s 11.5-inch NXTPAPER Pure display uses a 3:2 aspect ratio with a 2200 × 1440 resolution. It supports 16.7 million colors, reaches 300 nits of typical brightness, and refreshes at up to 120Hz, giving it a clear responsiveness advantage over E-Ink alternatives.

Since its inception, NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) has led this effort. CERES has a long history with seven different instruments flying on five different missions since 1997. As of today, six CERES instruments remain in orbit – two are no longer operational: the Proto-Flight Model (PFM) unit flew on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and functioned for a brief period, and FM2, which was powered-off in January 2025 due to battery constraints on Terra. The active CERES instruments are found on Terra (FM1), Aqua (FM3 and 4), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) (FM5), and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) mission, now known as NOAA-20 (FM6). Suomi NPP and the JPSS mission are partnerships…",

Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form.
