Samsung’s next in-house flagship mobile processor, the Exynos 2600 , was just officially announced as the world’s first smartphone chip built using the 2nm Gate-All-Around (GAA) manufacturing process. It’s rumored to be powering select Samsung Galaxy S26 models in some global markets, but there may be another upcoming Samsung flagship using the chip. The Samsung Exynos 2600 might also power the Galaxy Z Flip 8, according to a new report. As reported by The Bell , Samsung could use the Exynos 2600 chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 8, which is set to arrive next summer (via 9to5Google ). The report cites unnamed industry sources, and says that Samsung is considering the Exynos 2600 for its next flip phone — nothing has been decided yet.",

Syncing won’t resume automatically — you need to reconnect your Google account to Movies Anywhere to restore it. The fix closes the last major fallout from the feud, which had already been resolved elsewhere weeks ago. If you use Movies Anywhere to keep your movie purchases in one place, there’s some low-key good news to end the week. After disappearing during YouTube TV and Disney’s contract spat , syncing for Google Play and YouTube purchases is finally working again. As reported by 9to5Google , Google Play and YouTube have now been restored as Movies Anywhere partners. Disney owns Movies Anywhere, and the service dropped Google support during the dispute, resulting in a break in cross-platform syncing. Now that Google has been reinstated, things are mostly back to normal. You just have to take one extra step.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR Lenovo might release a new variant of its Legion Go 2 gaming handheld. Instead of Windows 11 or an ROG Ally-style Xbox interface, this Legion Go 2 version is expected to run SteamOS. SteamOS is likely to improve users’ experience with better power management and a console-like interface. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 gaming handheld was first showcased at the CES 2025 conference, but it didn’t make it to the market as late as the October. So, an upgraded version makes little sense. However, Lenovo may be looking to expand options for potential buyers by offering another variant that runs SteamOS instead of Windows. As per a recent leak, Lenovo may be gearing up to reveal this new variant of the Legion Go 2 at CES 2026, exactly a year after the first reveal. Windows Latest says the step to introduce a new variant stems from the unoptimized Windows experience on the small screen. While Lenovo had the option to choose the Xbox full-screen experience (FSE) , as did with the 2025 variants of ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X. However, it appears to have gone with SteamOS for its advantages, including lower hardware requirements, better power management,…",

YouTube says the change is meant to make it more straightforward to tune Shorts recommendations. Along with almost every other element of the platform, YouTube has been tinkering with how feedback works on Shorts for a while. The experimenting continues, and some viewers are about to see another switch-up. This time, YouTube is testing a new take on the Dislike button that affects both its placement and exact meaning. In a post on the Google Support forums , YouTube says it’s experimenting with folding “Dislike” and “Not interested” into a single thumbs-down option for Shorts. Rather than sitting on the main video UI, the button will now be tucked away behind the three-dot menu. Depending on the test group, it may appear as “Dislike” or “Not interested,” but the action itself remains the same.",

It had to be, owing to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5’s improved architecture , OnePlus’ abiding emphasis on internal cooling tech, the new highly responsive 165Hz display, and the brand’s general fidelity to users who expect more than just the basics from their phones. But my colleagues’ initial reactions to the phone shook that conviction. In their initial testing, my colleague Robert Triggs found the new phone running at nearly scorching temperatures . That’s a good thing if you’re near the North Pole, helping Santa pack gifts for kids. But for the rest of us mere mortals, those temperatures — I’m talking about nearly 53°C (127°F) on the surface, were bothersome, and especially harrowing for mobile gamers who intend to use it for several dozen minutes, if not hours, holding the phone in their hands while fragging foes in leading FPS games.",

Compared to existing foldables, it may be wider than Google’s Pixel Fold, but not as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apple is expected to announce the device by late 2026, though shipments might not stabilize until mid-to-late 2027 due to production ramp-up issues. The Galaxy Z TriFold is attracting all the proper attention this year, but Samsung has its task cut out for next year. While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 impressed, and the Fold 8 is expected to continue that streak, Apple is also rumored to launch the iPhone Fold, giving stiff competition to Samsung’s foldables. We’ve heard about the iPhone Fold’s unconventional shape, and new leaks are now shedding more light on the iPhone Fold’s exact dimensions and its potential design.

That ease of use is one of the Pixel’s biggest selling points, but it also means many features find themselves sitting unnoticed in the background. Earlier this month, my colleague Joe Maring dug into that side of the Pixel Camera app, highlighting seven hidden settings that many owners either forget about or never discover in the first place. The list covered everything from composition tools and focus controls to storage and Motion Photo tweaks, all aimed at showing just how much flexibility is hidden beneath the surface.",

Ironically, however, these devices, including the premium ones, suffer from far more bugs than most other popular Android devices. While most of them, thankfully, get fixed in a matter of weeks , there has been one protracted bug that hasn’t been resolved in over a year. And it’s driving people up the wall. For months now, owners of several Google Pixel phones have been experiencing issues connecting to the head unit in their cars. According to several reports, Pixel phones don’t automatically connect to the car’s units immediately and require users to do it manually.

Zero gravity indicators are small, plush items carried aboard spacecraft to provide a visual indication of when the spacecraft and its crew reach space. For the first eight minutes after liftoff, the crew and their indicator nearby will still be pushed into their seats by gravity, and the force of the climb into space. When the main engines of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s core stage cut off, gravity’s restraints are lifted, but the crew will still be strapped safely into their seats – their zero gravity indicator’s ability to float will provide proof that they’ve made it into space.

It’s a system-level component, meaning it can’t be uninstalled without root access and can only be toggled off. Even when disabled, the system reportedly attempts to restart Lock Glimpse every few seconds, resulting in unnecessary background activity. Nothing’s latest software experiment is turning into an unexpected headache, and it’s testing the patience of some of the brand’s loyal fans. The trouble is with Lock Glimpse, a lock-screen feature in Nothing OS 4.0 , which started as an optional addition but is now sparking real concern about battery life. Lock Glimpse first appeared in beta builds of Nothing OS 4.0 . On paper, it sounds harmless enough. Nothing frames it as a discovery-focused lock screen experience. You wake your phone and see rotating images paired with short headlines, each linking out to a web article. The pitch is that it adds variety and context.

Update: December 18, 2025 (4:33 AM ET): It appears that Google has reconsidered this change and reverted it, allowing you to easily uninstall updates again. As Android Authority contributor AssembleDebug pointed out on X , once you update a pre-installed system app, the “Uninstall” button appears next to the “Open” button following the install, as it did previously.",

With December more than half over, many of us have our sights solidly on what’s coming up next, with holidays and the new year just days away.

What’s the most desirable phone around right now? For a whole lot of reasons, smartphone fans this year have been intrigued by Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold . Right now, it’s still out of touch for most of us (we were lucky enough to score the hands-on time you can watch above) between restricted international availability, a sky-high price tag, and limited stock causing it to quickly sell out. Eventually that will change — will you pick one up then?

Google Meet can now share your system audio, allowing meeting participants to hear sound from any app or source on your computer. Google Meet is a free and simple video conferencing program, but it’s not without limitations. The software supports sharing Google Chrome tabs, system windows, and even the presenter’s entire screen to create a collaborative experience with meeting participants. However, Google Meet was historically less versatile when it came to sharing system audio. In an update, Google is tweaking Meet to handle audio sharing better, adding support for sharing device audio with the group. While presenting a specific app window or your computer’s entire screen, Meet can now share your device’s complete system audio with meeting participants. This makes it possible for users to play audio from an app that’s running in the background during a Meet call. Before the change, Google Meet users had to present a specific tab to share audio from a site with the group.",

A few years ago, taking an Android phone into an area without cell service meant you were completely cut off — unable to text friends, family, or even emergency services. Today, however, you wouldn’t be so disconnected thanks to satellite connectivity , a feature that links your phone directly to satellites orbiting Earth. Google introduced platform support for satellite connectivity in last year’s Android release, though the feature was initially limited to emergency messaging. The technology has advanced significantly since then, however, paving the way for features like WhatsApp calling and live location sharing even without cellular coverage.",

Network improvements are likely to be real but fairly incremental, with limited short-term impact for most users. Earlier this year, T-Mobile formally acquired US Cellular’s customer base , retail footprint, and some of its spectrum in the process. That said, the company behind US Mobile continues as Array. Going forward, Array’s core business is to license its massive collection of former US Cellular towers to other companies, with T-Mobile signing a deal in May to use over 2,000 of them to boost its own coverage.

The OnePlus Pad Go 2 features a 12.1-inch 2.8K (2,800 x 1,980 resolution) 120Hz LCD with Dolby Vision support, offering a peak brightness of 900 nits. The display size is larger than its predecessor, but the Pad Go 2 retains the squarish 7:5 aspect ratio for a book-like layout.

The new OnePlus 15R tries to keep that streak going, playing to OnePlus’s strengths of performance and battery life while costing less than its flagship sibling, the OnePlus 15. But with a fan-favorite feature gone, OnePlus’ software heading in the wrong direction, and areas like camera quality and wireless charging being left on the back burner, it makes this year’s OnePlus R phone a much less attractive option — especially with another price increase that pushes it all the way up to $700.",

With that in mind, the company has launched the Homey Self-Hosted Server, a new software-only option that lets you run the Homey Pro operating system on your own hardware. Available globally from today, it gives advanced users a way to host Homey locally on devices like a Raspberry Pi, NAS , or small home server, rather than relying on dedicated Homey hardware or cloud-only control.

We spotted this quality-of-life improvement in the latest Android Canary build, and it could arrive in the Android 16 QPR3 stable release next March. When you want to share something on your screen but don’t want to — or can’t — get a link to the content, you can just take a screenshot . If what you’re trying to capture is too long to fit on screen, you can take a scrolling screenshot to capture more than what the display shows. Scrolling screenshots are a relatively new addition to Android, introduced back in Android 12 . Since then, Google has barely touched the feature, but it’s finally preparing a small but welcome quality-of-life improvement. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

New Galaxy S day used to be the standout event of the Android phone launch calendar. However, between leaks pointing to modest upgrades and early reactions to the phones’ overall direction, there’s a growing sense that 2026 might be another conservative year for the device lineup, at best. If Samsung has picked up on this vibe, it must be setting off some alarm bells at HQ. That backdrop is what led us to ask you a blunt question about your expectations in a recent opinion piece by my colleague Rita. Specifically, we wanted to know if you think that the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will underperform their competitors in 2026. For her part, Rita argued that Samsung’s smaller flagships look set to lag behind rivals on specs, value, and ambition, even if they still sell well. Judging by your responses to the poll, a lot of you aren’t convinced Samsung is going to keep pace this time around.",
