She was just 13 years old when she played Miley Stewart, a teenager leading a secret double life as a Malibu student by day and a global pop star by night. The show ran until 2011. After her success on the show, Cyrus made a bold transformation with a more edgy and provocative image, releasing albums like 2010’s Can’t Be Tamed and 2013’s Bangerz , the latter debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

Not only did the Kiwi pop star &#8212; fresh off of a devastating heartbreak and in the trenches of gender discovery and body-image issues &#8212; craft much of Virgin with producer Jim-E Stack after relocating to NYC four years ago, she also channeled the city&#8217;s energy into every facet of the album.
