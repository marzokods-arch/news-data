I want to feel it. I want people to watch it and enjoy it.” Selecting the setlist for the halftime performance proved to be one of the biggest challenges. “That was tough,” he admitted. “Even for my shows on tour, it’s hard to pick 30 or 40 songs. So imagine for 30 minutes. It was very hard. The selection process was very intense.” Rather than focusing on hits alone, Bad Bunny said he approached the show as a storytelling exercise. “I had a vision about the story, the mood, and the feelings that I want to put on that show,” he explained. “I want people to feel happiness and joy.

Fortunately, the 5th Dimension got their flowers in 2021 with the release of Ahmir “ Questlove ” Thompson’s Oscar-winning documentary Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised).
