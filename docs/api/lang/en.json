    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR A security researcher found that Gemini is susceptible to ASCII smuggling attacks. These attacks hide malicious prompts in emails or calendar invites that LLMs can read when asked to summarize text. Google has dismissed the threat as a social engineering attack, placing the responsibility on the end user. Google tends to take the security of its users seriously, implementing a range of measures to keep its products safe to use. In fact, that’s part of the thought process behind the company’s crackdown on sideloading apps from unverified developers on Android. But it looks like the company isn’t too concerned about fixing an issue that makes Gemini susceptible to a troubling type of cyber threat. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The Thornton brothers brought Let God Sort Em Ou t to the holy ground for a poignant performance of Clipse&#8217;s album opener &#8220;The Birds Don&#8217;t Sing,&#8221; which is an emotional tribute to their late parents. Pusha T and Malice feel they carry a responsibility to bring hip-hop to places it hasn&#8217;t been before while continuing to elevate the genre. “It was definitely a moment for us,” Malice told&nbsp; VIBE . “I think we definitely broke ground. It’s overdue and past time that people understand that hip-hop belongs everywhere. It’s expression, it’s communication, it teaches the world about our culture. It’s an art form that’s celebrated in every walk of life. It’s nothing that should be surprising — we should be celebrated everywhere.” While King Push reflected on the genre&#8217;s fight for exposure and recognition, adding: &#8220;I’ve been here for a long time with hip-hop, and I remember it not being seen as an art, and it not being televised.

Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025.

It features noticeable upgrades to the base iPhone 17, a new design for the iPhone 17 Pro, and an all-new iPhone Air that is a joy to hold . If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.

Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

These new alerts aim to solve the service’s poor discoverability, as many users are unaware that Health Connect exists on their phones. The prompts come as Google prepares to expand the platform with new features, such as native step tracking in an upcoming Android update. There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022. Although the number of compatible apps and its feature set have grown steadily since its debut, many people still don’t know it exists. That’s why Google is sending alerts prompting users to connect their apps to Health Connect. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The message will include the hashtag #AndroidEarthquakeAlerts. Google launched an earthquake alert system for Android back in 2020, allowing users to get early warnings before the shaking begins. In 2024, the tech giant expanded the feature to cover all 50 states in the US, plus six US territories. Now, an APK teardown reveals the Mountain View firm is working on a new update that should help spread the word when an earthquake happens.

Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well.

It’s been four years since Google launched a new Nest Hub. The most recent one — Nest Hub (2nd Gen) — came out in 2021, and since then, we haven’t seen a true-blue smart display from Google. This is also partially because in 2023, Google launched the Pixel Tablet, which doubles up as a smart home display when docked. However, even when Google introduced its tablet refresh, the company never explicitly said that it’s killing off the Nest hub line.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is testing a new feature in Chrome for Android that automatically requests the desktop version of websites when used in the new Desktop Mode. The feature works by changing the browser’s user agent when connected to an external display, so sites don’t load their mobile layouts by default. This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.
