They put me to work though. There are these bugs called Praying Mantises. They lay eggs and they form pods on the Douglas Fir Christmas trees. It’s their favorite tree to infest,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I would walk around the Christmas trees all day and pick them off and put them in a little basket.&#8221; But her devotion to the holiday goes beyond her Entomological efforts as a child. Following her 2006 self-titled debut, Swift released The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection EP in 2007 that contains six cuts – four covers and two original offerings, &#8220;Christmases When You Were Mine&#8221; and &#8220;Christmas Must Be Something More.&#8221; Since then, she’s written one more explicitly festive song – 2019’s &#8220;Christmas Tree Farm&#8221; – and one that has found its way into the Swiftian zeitgeist as a yuletide track.

That kind of data is critical, because as the United States returns to the Moon, both through NASA’s Artemis campaign and the commercialization of space, researchers need to understand the hazards that may occur when a lander’s engine plumes blast away at the lunar dust, soil, and rocks. These data will be valuable to NASA’s commercial partners as they develop their human landing systems that will safely transport astronauts from lunar orbit to the Moon’s surface and back for Artemis, beginning with Artemis III in 2027.

    "body": "Nicolas Escurat A flash of lightning, and then—something else. High above a storm, a crimson figure blinks in and out of existence. If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.
