    "body": "By holding at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (dated Nov. 1) for a third week with The Life of a Showgirl , Taylor Swift ups her career total of weeks at No. 1 on that chart to 89 – a tally topped by only one act in the chart’s 69-year history. The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 43-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist.

His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week. If you count the&nbsp; Saturday Night Fever &nbsp;soundtrack (which logged 24 weeks at No. 1 in 1978) as…",
