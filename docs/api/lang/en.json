This might allow for better thermal performance, camera improvements, or improved battery life. The Galaxy S26 isn’t expected to launch until February, but leaks have continued to flow in at a steady pace. Earlier today, the Galaxy S26 Plus leaked in its iPhone 17 Pro-esque orange hue. Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",

Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

I wanted it to feel fluid, futuristic, and free—not just another shoe but a living design.” The sneaker, which quickly became a streetwear standout this year, fuses performance-ready materials with visual design inspired by aquatic life.

It follows Samsung Health’s recent upgrade that added smarter wellness insights and body-tracking tools, making the app feel more like a true fitness hub.

The credit card may offer cashback, which can be redeemed against Samsung products, including phones. In addition to the card, Samsung is also said to be exploring financial products such as high-yield savings, digital prepaid accounts, and BNPL. One of the significant perks of owning an iPhone is that you walk into a seamless ecosystem of convenience. While many people feel suffocated by the walled garden, others appreciate how easy it makes their lives. For instance, iPhone users in the US can apply for an Apple Card, a credit card that is designed primarily for use with Apple Pay on Apple devices. Android doesn’t have a competing product, but it seems that could soon be changing as Samsung is in talks to launch its own co-branded consumer credit card in the US.

Based on Google Chrome ’s underpinnings, Samsung Internet Beta is a breath of fresh air. It’s 2025, and the odd mandatory mention of AI features is present, but Samsung Internet isn’t an “AI browser” in the same vein as OpenAI’s Atlas or Perplexity’s Comet . It is far more traditional in its philosophy and offers excellent design decisions that improve upon Chrome’s usability, privacy, and multitasking capabilities.",

However, only the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a Snapdragon SoC. The base Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S26 Plus could come with the Exynos 2600 instead. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also staring at an imminent price increase. The Galaxy S26 series has been a hot topic of discussion, more so than recent Galaxy S series flagships. The big reasons for this are the leaks and demise of the Galaxy S26 Edge (and even a “More Slim” reincarnation ), the death of the Galaxy S26 Pro , and the revival of the Galaxy S26 Plus — all before Samsung could make a public announcement. We’re receiving more leaks, bringing good news for early 2026 release and availability, but bad news for Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus’ SoC, and bad news for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s price tag.

However, as is often the case in life, what’s easiest isn’t always the best, and this is especially true for smartphone apps that non-tech-savvy users might employ.

That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses. And even though I’m not too fond of making every wearable “smart,” if glasses could handle nutrition tracking for me, I’d happily throw my wallet at them.",

The company reportedly plans to shut down less-profitable stores and cut staff across remaining locations, while expanding AI automation to fill the gaps. It’s unclear if other big changes will be announced around this time, though it’s possible that there’s more to this coming shift than just layoffs. Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?

With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals.

According to Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s 3x telephoto will be downgraded — and not upgraded, as was recently suggested. They say these changes are made to accommodate the slimmer profile of the upcoming Samsung flagship. There are two cadres of Android flagships. In the first category, brands such as OnePlus work tirelessly to make each new phone appear radically different from its predecessor. In the other category, brands such as Samsung reiterate a proven formula and introduce a new phone with some internal changes and minimal cosmetic variations. In the case of the Galaxy S26, too, we’re witnessing the same pattern repeated, where only minor optimization-oriented tweaks are, once again, expected to take priority over anything radical. That also holds for the camera we see on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, which is expected to undergo only minimal variations — or so we thought until yesterday, when a leak hinted at one of the four cameras being upgraded . That may turn out to be untrue, as reputed leaker Ice Universe has strongly opposed these leaks.",

Instead of only solving the daily word, you can make them yourself.

If you’re an All Access or Games subscriber, you’re able to design custom challenges using any four- to seven-letter word. You can then send it to your friends and family, who don’t need to be NYT Games subscribers to play it.",

Samsung’s latest Z Fold 7 moved away from the under-display selfie cameras previous models used. Apple’s first foldable could launch in the second half of 2026. Smartphone manufacturers tend to get ideas from each other.

Following the success of folding phones from the likes of Samsung and OPPO, Apple is reportedly working on a foldable of its own. We’ve known that for a while, but now, we’ve seen more evidence that suggests the first folding iPhone will use an under-display camera embedded in its internal display. We first heard that the foldable iPhone would feature an under-display camera by way of a May leak . Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold phones used similar technology through the Z Fold 6 until switching to a more conventional hole-punch design in the Z Fold 7.

T-Mobile was saving its best offer for last it seems, as it has announced a few new holiday deals. Chief among these offers is a promotion that gives you four lines and four phones for $25 per line , all without any trade-ins required.

    "body": "Credit: Niagara Launcher TL;DR Niagara Launcher is receiving a new visual update, featuring a range of new themes and wallpapers. Unlike traditional minimalist wallpapers, Niagara is bringing several new intricately designed illustrations for wallpapers. The update also improves backup features and adds Bing as a search engine option. Niagara Launcher is one of the most distinct Android launchers , and its impact extends beyond its visual characteristics. Having used it for over two years, I can confirm that it alters — in a good way — how you approach the app drawer. I now install it on all the phones I review and strongly recommend it too. However, there’s one aspect that keeps me from feeling completely satisfied, which is the limitation of using wallpapers of my choice. The launcher’s peculiar design for the app list makes it difficult to use visually rich wallpapers, but this issue may be getting addressed with a new update. In July, the developers of the launcher introduced a new theme playground , enabling users to experiment with various clock styles, wallpapers, and colors. Now, Niagara Launcher is getting another visual upgrade with a host of new themes, icon packs, wall…",

Usually, I’d take my Fuji mirrorless along to snap some neat pictures of our local bonfire and skies full of delightful fireworks. But this year, with two boundless toddlers to shepherd, I decided I’d probably need both hands free and would have to rely on my smartphone for quick snaps instead. On the plus side, I’d been looking for an excuse to test out the dedicated “Fireworks” mode in the OnePlus 13 and OPPO Find X8 Pro (I’m using the latter) camera apps. The mode seems to combine long and short exposures, providing vivid detail with well-exposed lighting and colors. Given that I probably wouldn’t have time to optimize shutter speed and ISO while keeping an eye on the little ones, this mode would do all the heavy lifting for me.",

Among other features, we could see the option to click pictures at 24MP by default instead of the existing 12MP or 50MP modes. Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series appears to have kept Samsung busier than usual. While the lineup was slated to receive an overhaul with new product names, the changes were reportedly quashed recently, forcing Samsung to return to the older classification . And all this toiling may have contributed to a delayed launch and fewer upgrades to the Galaxy S26 series than we had hoped , especially in the camera department. While the camera itself isn’t receiving any significant upgrades, some of the software features supporting it are expected to improve. One way we can see this improvement is by adding additional camera settings options to Samsung phones through a first-party extension.",

However, there’s one significant caveat — graphics stress tests hit blistering highs of 56°C to maintain peak performance over time. That’s far too hot to hold the phone comfortably.
