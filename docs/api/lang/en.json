We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions. Sony’s not really a major player in the smartphone space these days, but this seems like the type of trend we should expect to see gain traction over the next c…",

Readers feel that Google Pixels, which are priced as flagships, largely lack the performance to justify the price tag. While some fans appreciate the AI features and software integration of the chip, many believe that its flaws outweigh its benefits. The recently launched Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 looks promising on paper, and Qualcomm seems poised for another successful year, securing its place among top Android flagships once again. Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C. Scott Brown is actually glad that Pixels don’t use Snapdragon . Much like he predicted, this opinion was highly controversial, and it seems a lot of our readers are done forgiving Tensor for its mediocrity. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR A leaked internal document suggests T-Mobile will re-farm LTE spectrum bands for 5G use in the near future. LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance. Still, it appears LTE’s days are numbered, at least for those on the T-Mobile network. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The matched rates are locked for 36 months, but prices will rise afterward, making it a short-term value play rather than a permanent discount. Verizon has a well-earned reputation for solid network performance, but at a much higher price than the competition. Over the last few years, this has changed a bit as T-Mobile has become a major leader in 5G and beyond. The truth is that all three major carriers now offer fairly similar features and performance overall, though it ultimately depends on where you live.

I couldn’t afford to buy an iPhone, and its price, padded with hefty import fees, made it a dream I refused to approach. Over the years, I became more fascinated with Android’s customization. A decade and a half later, I consciously stick to Android phones. While my attempts at heavily modding my phones or fiddling with custom ROMs have decreased significantly, there are two things I still actively do: change wallpapers routinely and switch to a new launcher every few weeks or months, actively hopping between multiple awesome launchers on Android .",

In a matter of a few weeks, Samsung has rolled out the update to the last three generations of flagship bar phones and foldable devices, along with some tablets and affordable A-series phones. Now, it’s trickling down deeper and reaching the Galaxy S22 series , which started to receive its first One UI 8 update. The stable One UI 8 update has arrived for the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra, as highlighted by noted Samsung tipster Tarun Varun on an X post . It weighs in at about 3.2GB and upgrades the Android version to 16. The update is available to a user in Turkey, so a global rollout can be expected to follow soon.",

However, they largely failed to live up to this promise. In fact, some smart speakers, including those in Google’s Home ecosystem , have even seen a significant decline in reliability. This decline raises the question of what, if anything, tech companies are doing to reverse the trend. Google’s answer is to bring its Gemini AI into the smart home. Unveiled this week, Gemini for Home upgrades the conversational experience in Google Home smart speakers, displays, doorbells, and cameras with AI, while also introducing smarter media controls, improved alerts, and more intelligent search capabilities.",

However, and this is important, neither of these apps is an independent platform — they both still rely on Google Calendar to save and serve events. To find a true G Cal alternative, I’d have to look elsewhere. That’s where my curiosity about Proton Calendar comes in. Perhaps best known for its VPN and mail clients, the Swiss-based company Proton offers users a complete calendaring platform independent of Google Calendar. Proton Calendar is one of the front-running contenders for those who want to deGoogle their devices and their lives. But is it any good? Well, I tried it, and I have mixed feelings.",

Does it really matter how the photo is created if you like the end result and it looks like what it’s supposed to look like? Well, that depends, and we’ll get to that, but first let’s dive in and take a look at what this 100x zoom looks like in real-life use. As far as the eye can see…and then some I was shocked the first time I scrolled all the way to the right on the zoom slider, snapped my photo, then watched the sparkles dance around on my screen as Google’s artificial intelligence worked to recreate and enhance what I only saw as a grainy, pixelated scene on my screen. Within a few moments, the dancing pixels dissolved to reveal the final result: an incredibly detailed and very accurate photograph of a scene that I could hardly see with my own eyes. Consider me mind-blown. That moment truly felt shocking.",

They failed for a variety of reasons — like price, redundancy, and utility — but the seeds they planted for a future of fully automated apps stuck around. These seeds grew into the “agentic AI” trend we see today.

I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths . Many of those points still hold, but awareness has improved, and so has prepaid market penetration.

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority One of the most common complaints I keep reading from YouTube Music users is that Google treats it and their regular YouTube experience as one and the same. If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements. Strava also wants Garmin to stop selling products that may utilize these patents, which would include a slew of its fitness watches, cycling computers, and the Garmin Connect app. The lawsuit, first reported by fitness industry veteran DC Rainmaker , focuses on two primary features utilized by both companies: segments and heatmaps. Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route. Breaking down longer routes encourages users to hit more manageable targets across a more extended training session or race. Heatmaps, meanwhile, display areas and routes that users traffic heavily, effectively highlighting popular training areas. This is an excellent…",

That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

Samsung’s latest foldables , as well as the S25 series , S24 series , and even some tablets all have access to One UI 8 in at least some markets. Just a few days ago, One UI 8 started rolling out to Galaxy S23 phones in Korea , and now, it’s spread to other countries, as well. SamMobile has shared that Galaxy S23 users in Australia, Egypt, France, Germany, Malaysia, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine report receiving the update.

The mod, although bulky and aesthetically unappealing, significantly improves the phone’s sustained performance beyond what Apple has already achieved with the move to vapor chambers. The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs. But what if you wanted even better performance with even more heat dissipation and cooling? We’ve seen a few crazy cooling mods for phones, and this latest one attaches a bunch of SSD heatsinks onto the back of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The leak corroborates the feature activates automatically in crowded spaces. It also suggests users will have the option to choose which aspects to restrict and which ones to allow. The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels. More excitingly, Privacy Display may be triggered automatically in certain events, and we’re now seeing potential UI for this implementation.",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.
