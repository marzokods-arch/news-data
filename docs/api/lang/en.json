The reimagined version appears on the band’s new holiday EP, Taylor Momsen’s Pretty Reckless Christmas , released Friday (Oct. 31) via Fearless Records. The original ballad, co-written by Mariah Carey, James Horner, and Will Jennings, first appeared on the 2000 film’s soundtrack and was famously performed by Momsen at just seven years old. That same year, Faith Hill’s version reached No. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. Momsen’s 2025 update opens with a nostalgic snippet of her childhood recording before launching into a full-blown rock version, anchored by crunchy guitars and her signature gritty vocals. “Where are you, Christmas? Why can’t I find you?” she sings, giving the wistful lyrics new energy and edge. The six-track EP also includes four original songs — “I Wanna Be Your Christmas Tree,” “Christmas Is Killing Me,” “Blues on Christmas,” and “When We Were Young” — as well as a reprise titled “Christmas, Why Can’t I Find You.” “ Pretty Reckless Chr…",

The metal icon, who died in July at age 76 , spoke openly about the incident in later years. “I’ve achieved quite a lot in my life, but all people do is go, ‘Ozzy, what do bats really taste like?’” he told People in a 2022 interview. “But I’ll tell you what, when they gave me the rabies shot, I wasn’t smiling.” Osbourne maintained a close relationship with Sidney up until his death.

The incident occurred during the final song of the night, “Champagne Supernova,” when two flares were seen flying into the densely packed floor section of the sold-out stadium. One concertgoer told Australian outlet news.com.au that the flares sparked visible flashes among the crowd. “Each time you saw this flash, it looked like a fire, and then it was contained fairly quickly,” said Virginia, who attended the show with her 13-year-old daughter. The pair exited the venue early due to safety concerns. Security reportedly conducted thorough bag checks at the gate, though it remains unclear how the flares entered the venue or whether any injuries occurred. Marvel Stadium has yet to comment.

Rather than lose NewJeans — which would have created additional headaches for HYBE and other K-pop companies — ADOR will retain the group through the end of its exclusive contract in 2029. The fact that Min is no longer at ADOR didn’t sway the court. “Merely the fact that NewJeans personally places high trust in Min Hee-jin does not make guaranteeing her the position of ADOR’s CEO a significant obligation under the exclusive contract,” according to a report .
