The realme GT8 Pro indeed offers a 200MP 3x periscope camera (f/2.6, Isocell HP5, 1/1.56-inch) that supports 6x lossless resolution zoom and 25cm macro focusing. The rest of the camera system consists of a 50MP main camera (1/1.56-inch), a 50MP ultrawide shooter, and a 32MP selfie camera. In a neat touch, you can swap out the rear camera housings. So, if you fancy a circular housing, a square bump, or a robot-like housing, you can screw those on. Realme also said it will offer schematics so you can 3D-print your own housings.",

    "body": "TL;DR A Google Messages update will integrate your cloud photos and videos directly into the main media picker. This is powered by a new Android feature that lets apps embed the system’s photo picker experience. The change removes the extra tap needed to access your cloud library and improves security by no longer requiring broad gallery permissions. Google Messages makes it easy to share photos and videos from your phone, but accessing your cloud library isn’t as seamless as it could be. Currently, tapping the gallery button opens a media picker showing your most recent locally stored images. To access your Google Photos library, you need to tap the “Folders” button — an extra, slightly inconvenient step. Fortunately, an upcoming Google Messages update will integrate your cloud photos and videos directly into the main media picker, removing that extra step entirely.

But YouTube Premium isn’t perfect. Every few months, I’ll hear about a new experiment or new feature exclusive to Premium users , and think, “Gah, this isn’t what I want!” If it were up to me, YouTube would add more robust controls and customizations and offer them to Premium subscribers, instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel with a new comment page look or silly autoplay and Shorts hooks.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding GPU acceleration for graphical Linux apps to Android’s Terminal app, but the feature is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10. This feature relies on Gfxstream, a library that forwards graphics API calls from the guest Linux virtual machine to the host Android device’s GPU for accelerated rendering. Though the feature is live for Pixel 10 users in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3, it’s still buggy and doesn’t yet offer the near-native performance expected. Back in March, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app to Android, which uses virtualization to run full-fledged Linux programs on Android devices. While the initial release only supported command-line apps, Google is addressing that limitation in the upcoming Android 16 QPR2 update. Even though Android 16 QPR2 will add support for graphical desktop Linux apps , they will run poorly on most Android devices. This is because the Linux Terminal app currently relies on a software-based renderer called Lavapipe. Lavapipe uses the device’s CPU for complex calculations and rasterization (the process of converting vector graphics into pixels) — tasks that the device’s GPU can perform much more quickly and efficiently.",

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm’s powerful new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip unfortunately doesn’t support Android’s new Linux Terminal feature. This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

    "body": "Credit: Amazon TL;DR Amazon updated its Kindle Colorsoft FAQs with a candid disclaimer. The company says that black-and-white Kindles, like the Paperwhite, offer crisper text. Colorsoft screens still suit comics and PDFs, but trade sharpness for color. Update: October 20, 2025 (12:25 PM ET): Following the publication of the original article below, Amazon contacted us to highlight an amendment to the FAQ section on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. In response to the question “How is the reading experience different on Kindle Colorsoft than on Kindle Paperwhite?” the answer now reads “The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display, and includes a fully optimized display stack to deliver high quality color reading. The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard. The new FAQ answer removes this part to avoid such confusion and makes clear that the resolution o…",

A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games.

Fast forward to today, and it’s officially been over five months since T-Mobile and I parted ways. Now that the honeymoon phase with Visible is over and I’ve had time to really assess things, what’s my conclusion? Was the switch worth it?",

Although Nova Launcher’s death knell has already sounded, my recent thoughts have turned to Sesame Shortcuts’ dim future. But, for now at least, you can still integrate the powerful search app in your new Android launcher. Here’s how to do it, why you might want to think twice about it, and what you should consider before doing it.",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

    "body": "TL;DR A new animation that plays when skipping tracks from the lock screen in Samsung One UI 8.5 has appeared on Twitter. One UI 8.5 is not officially released yet and this animation is subject to change. A beta program for One UI 8.5 is expected to begin in the coming weeks. We’ve seen a lot of One UI 8.5 in recent weeks, stemming from leaked builds that have made their way out ahead of an official beta reportedly starting before the end of the year . Early this morning, a splashy new lock screen media animation from an in-progress One UI 8.5 build surfaced on Twitter. A video shared by Tarun Vats on Twitter demonstrates the new effect on a phone running One UI 8.5. When tapping to skip forward or back, large album art fades from one album to the next, along with a sort of wipe effect that expands from one or two seemingly random spots within the frame.",

Orders start October 19 at 8 PM PT, although full pricing and specs are not yet available. The Game Boy Advance SP was the original clamshell EDC, and countless gaming handhelds have been chasing that high ever since. Earlier this year, the Miyoo Flip tried and mostly failed due to a seriously compromised hinge design. Now the company is back with an even smaller version, and hopefully it’s learned from the previous release. The Miyoo Mini Flip has the same 2.8-inch screen as 2021’s Miyoo Mini, but apart from that, the company hasn’t announced specs or pricing. It’s almost certainly going to be a low-powered Linux device, most likely topping off at PS1 emulation.",

Most Android flagships look and feel the same these days, and unless you’re dabbling with foldables, it might be hard to get excited. However, occasionally, some OEMs experiment with the CMF of their phones, giving us some radically different smartphones that stand out from the crowd. The upcoming Redmi K90 Pro Max is one of those radically different phones that not only adopts a denim-like texture, but could also seemingly pack a rear-firing, Bose-tuned speaker.
