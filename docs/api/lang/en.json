So did such explosive hits such as as “Firework” and (directly after) “Grenade.” For every “Party Rock Anthem,” there was “A Bar Song” to sing along to (probably loudly if while tipsy). Meanwhile, no matter where music fans were, or any loyalties, we bopped to “Empire State of Mind” and “California Gurls” and everything in between.

To close out the high-octane clip, the rapper makes a final return to bring some comedic relief as he hops out of the car to dance with Marty on the side of the road.

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm is rumored to have added Android 16 support for its Snapdragon X PC chips. While it sparks hopes about Android-based PCs, there’s not enough evidence or clarity yet. One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops.

Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time.

    "body": "TL;DR Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus are tipped to get a new 50MP ISOCELL S5KGNG main sensor and a sharper 12MP telephoto upgrade. The S26 could also get a battery bump to 4,300mAh, while the S26 Plus could stay at 4,900mAh, with expected efficiency gains helping both phones last longer. Both phones may support Samsung’s APV video codec at up to 4K/60 on both the front and rear, regardless of whether they ship with the Exynos 2600 or Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. A new leak pins down major camera and battery changes for Samsung’s next mainstream flagships, and they’re more meaningful than the usual year-over-year tune-ups. As per details found by Smartprix in leaked firmware, both the upcoming Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus are poised to deliver noticeable improvements in imaging and endurance. Considering the S25 series drew criticism for modest hardware updates in these areas, the shift feels intentional. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

It replaces the older option for downloading images before sharing with the option to share pictures with public links. Whether that improves sharing or causes more friction is a matter of debate. Ever since its launch, Google’s Nano Banana has stirred up numerous viral trends for AI-generated images. And unless you’re at odds with AI and uphold that it cannot replace true art, you’re likely to have participated in some of these trends yourself. To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place. And now, Google appears to be adding another option that changes how you share them. Google is changing how you share images generated with Gemini or Nano Banana.

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Microsoft Edge on Android is receiving a significant upgrade to extension support. The latest Edge beta on Android expands the list of supported extensions from nearly 20 previously, now allowing you to install virtually any one of the thousands of supported extensions. The feature is hidden, but you can enable it by following the simple steps listed below. Google Chrome is undisputedly the most widely used web browser on both desktop and mobile devices. But if there’s one feature that makes the mobile version feel incomplete, it’s the lack of extension support. Since it is a highly requested feature, Google is working on bringing extension support to Chrome on Android , although we aren’t yet close to delivering it as a feature. Meanwhile, some other web browsers on Android already allow you to use extensions , and one of them is receiving a significant upgrade in this regard. Since Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium (the framework that powers Chrome), it also supports Chrome extensions. Edge’s Android version has supported extensions for over a year, and the built-in extension store allows you to choose from a selection of 20-so…",

A cybersecurity firm said the hackers initially compromised devices by sending malicious files via KakaoTalk. It’s recommended that you enable two-factor authentication on your Google account and regularly change your password. It’s not uncommon for hackers to turn your favorite apps and services against you, and it turns out cybercriminals are abusing Google Find Hub to remotely track and wipe victims’ Android phones and tablets. Security firm Genians (h/t: Bleeping Computer ) reports that North Korean state-backed hackers were compromising victims’ Android devices by using malicious files sent via the KakaoTalk chat app. The malicious scripts would then lie dormant on a user’s device, while also installing additional scripts to monitor and control the system. This way, the cybercriminals are able to harvest credentials for a variety of accounts and services.",

While Verizon’s rumored meeting this month may talk about employee layoffs, it’s less clear about the intentions for this meeting. The timing may just align with T-Mobile’s usual pre–holiday sales prep, discussing promotions, goals, or new initiatives like the T-Mobile credit card or T-Life rollout. Earlier this week, there were rumors that Verizon might be announcing some big changes later this month, as talks of potential layoffs are in the air. It’s still unclear if there’s any real substance to the claims, but it seems that they aren’t the only carrier with rumored changes ahead. As first reported by Visible-Bonus-9387 via Reddit , it seems T-Mobile stores around the country are set for a big meeting on November 23. According to the employee, it will be about “something big”.

Last week’s reports revealed that Apple will pay Google around $1 billion a year for a custom-built Gemini AI model to power the next version of Siri, expected to debut with iOS 26.4 next spring. It’s a huge deal between two rivals, but according to a new report, Apple isn’t planning to draw attention to who’s behind the technology. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers. Gurman adds that Apple prefers to present it as part of its own system, even though much of the core model isn’t.",

Google is making the switch from Google Assistant to Gemini on its smart home products, including Home and Nest speakers and displays.

If you’ve dealt with US Mobile in the past, you might be under the assumption that you have to pick just one network and stick with it, as that was somewhat true in the past, but thankfully not anymore. US Mobile does offer the ability to switch between carriers. In fact, there are two different methods available.",

The Galaxy S26 isn’t expected to launch until February, but leaks have continued to flow in at a steady pace. Earlier today, the Galaxy S26 Plus leaked in its iPhone 17 Pro-esque orange hue. Right along with the bigger sibling, we’re also witnessing the regular Galaxy S26 leak in digital renders. This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed the Galaxy S26 leak. The difference, however, is that back when we first saw these renders, it was expected to be called the Galaxy S26 Pro as part of Samsung’s intended reshuffle for the lineup. However, with Samsung correcting course and returning to the original lineup , we’re now expecting the smaller model to release as Galaxy S26 — sans the “Pro” suffix.",

    "body": "Credit: Baseus If you’ve recently picked up an iPhone 17 or plan to soon, you might be due for an upgrade to your charger as well. Baseus is one of the biggest names in mobile accessories, and it recently launched its next-gen PicoGo series. As the holiday season rolls around, both devices are already discounted for Black Friday. These are among the first Qi2.2-certified products on the market, offering faster speeds, smarter magnetic alignment, and safer charging for iPhone and Android alike. Qi2.2 offers a max 25W charging speed, making wireless charging as fast as wired. iPhone 16 and 17 models already support it, while Android manufacturers like Google and Samsung are lining up to adopt the standard. For anyone who uses their phone as a work tool, camera, or travel companion, grabbing a compatible charger is a future-proofing move.",

That means I have to open them in a browser on my phone to use them, which is less than ideal . It’s not as convenient, and I lose the option of getting notifications that would provide value to my life.",

This would be thicker than the Galaxy S25 Edge (5.8mm), but the S26 is expected to be more capable than the S25 Edge. The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to launch early next year, and we initially expected to see the Galaxy S26 Pro instead of the base Galaxy S26.

However, only the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a Snapdragon SoC. The base Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S26 Plus could come with the Exynos 2600 instead. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is also staring at an imminent price increase. The Galaxy S26 series has been a hot topic of discussion, more so than recent Galaxy S series flagships. The big reasons for this are the leaks and demise of the Galaxy S26 Edge (and even a “More Slim” reincarnation ), the death of the Galaxy S26 Pro , and the revival of the Galaxy S26 Plus — all before Samsung could make a public announcement. We’re receiving more leaks, bringing good news for early 2026 release and availability, but bad news for Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus’ SoC, and bad news for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s price tag.

    "body": "The Android apps that come preinstalled on a phone have several advantages. For one, they’re already there — you don’t need to visit the Play Store and sift through numerous options to find one that might meet your needs. Secondly, they’re usually from the manufacturer itself, which means they’re tightly integrated into the broader framework of your phone. However, as is often the case in life, what’s easiest isn’t always the best, and this is especially true for smartphone apps that non-tech-savvy users might employ. These users might benefit more from a more approachable or supportive product that you or they would need to install.",

That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option.

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me.

I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses.

Android upgrades include dual-screen improvements and ARMSX2 support. For as fun as emulating games is, it can also get real messy, real fast. Juggling a bunch of different emulators, each targeting different hardware, makes gaming feel more complicated than we’d like — which is exactly why we’re fans of a good emulation frontend like ES-DE (you can even run it as your launcher ). Today we’re getting a nice upgrade to start off our gaming weekend, as ES-DE delivers some useful new features and Android support for additional systems.

The company reportedly plans to shut down less-profitable stores and cut staff across remaining locations, while expanding AI automation to fill the gaps. It’s unclear if other big changes will be announced around this time, though it’s possible that there’s more to this coming shift than just layoffs. Last week, I wrote an opinion about the current state of Verizon , as well as some of the moves it might need to make to right the ship. I also mentioned it seemed obvious that store closures would be part of this process and that Verizon’s situation would likely get worse before it got better. It seems this may be happening sooner rather than later, as rumors of imminent closures are flying around on online communities like Reddit and The Layoff. Likewise, a few publications have also picked up on the rumors, such as Phone Arena . Is there any truth to the rumors, and if so, how big a cull are we talking about?

Reviews have to be one of the most frustrating-to-navigate components of life online — one that we nonetheless find ourselves returning to time and time again. When you don’t know exactly what the best option for you is just yet, a good user review can really be illuminating. But finding that good one can sometimes require trudging through screens of low-quality submissions, AI slop, and even the work of paid shills. If you’re looking for some help finding the one review that really speaks to your needs, the Google Play Store appears to be working on a tool that might be right up your alley.
