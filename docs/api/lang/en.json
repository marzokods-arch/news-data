In all, the project cost a little over $150, not counting all of the very spenny personal 3D printing equipment the rest of the build requires. CNCDan has made all of this project's 3D printing model files open source via his GitHub , alongside a full bill of materials if you fancy trying to build this affordable VR headset yourself. The creator is big into sim racing, spending much of his free time building parts for his own rig that …",

Deckard, for those unaware, is Valve's long-, long-, long -anticipated VR headset that's expected to be a standalone device not requiring PC power, unlike the Valve Index . We first caught wind of it back in June 2022, thanks to a December 2021 patent application . Since then, we've had rumour after rumour, including that 'Roy' controllers for Deckard were being tooled last year, that Valve was importing VR manufacturing equipment into the US earlier this year , and that some influencers recently travelled to Seattle and were a little cryptic about it. It's one of those things that has been on the cards for such a long time that it has somehow seemed to be imminently approaching, and yet also a little like a fable we'll never see the real sight of.

Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 is impressive. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year. Place your palm on the pavement, and you can feel the low rumble of a hobby yearning for the return of what we loved 15 years ago: the spectacle of scale , the unserious chaos of vehicular warfare, red grunts vs. blue grunts, the permission to make your own rules , and an environment where the guy obsessed with metas is having the least fun.

Not to me, it's not. Judging from the video demonstration above, the real magic occurs in the last stage of the pipeline, where the neural model cleans up the speech even better than the Wiener filter does (no sniggering, that's a serious scientific term ). Apparently this method of snooping can be performed on \"consumer-grade mice with high-fidelity sensors\", which sounds a lot like \"gaming mouse\" to me. That does seem to be exactly the case, as in the full paper (pdf warning) we can see the researchers used a Razer Viper at 8 kHz polling to train the models used for this attack. I suppose one of the key requirements is a high polling rate, as a higher polling rate means more data, which means more accurate data clean-up to isolate acoustics, ie, speech: \"Attackers can exploit these sensors’ ever-increasing pol…",

He broadly reckons that the US stock markets are overheated, and says \"the level of uncertainty in most peoples' minds should be higher.\" This isn't all about AI: Dimon cites \"a lot of things out there\" like the geopolitical situation, fiscal spending and remilitarisation, a topic he seems quite keen on. \"All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,\" he said. \"So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal.\" Dimon says his internal sense of the probabilities would be \"a higher probability than the market and maybe others… i…",

While Blue Protocol: Star Resonance doesn't have a character gacha in the same way that Genshin Impact does, it features a costume gacha instead. For this, you'll need Meowlux Wish Coins, which you'll purchase with Rose Orbs (the game's main premium currency) and what I expect will be the most desirable code currency. While you'll unlock the ability to redeem codes almost immediately, you'll have to progress a teensy bit further until you do the Thunder Demon Smackdown (essentially combat training) in the Seabreeze Festival to unlock the gacha. After that, you'll be able to access the \"Wish\" section in the menu. Blue Protocol: Star Resonance codes There are no Star Resonance codes currently.

Mahjong? That's a roguelike . Minesweeper? It's a roguelike. Those weird coin pusher machines that are for some reason present in every English seaside town? You better believe they're roguelikes . In that company, a slot machine roguelike seems almost obvious, though CloverPit certainly injects the idea with plenty of personality.

It was an appropriate location to do so, as the US state is also home to multiple Intel foundries, and Fab 52 is one of two that operate its newest process node: Intel 18A. This particular semiconductor chip production method is responsible for making the key tile, or chiplet, that lies at the heart of every Panther Lake processor. But where Intel's previous tiled architectures, Meteor Lake (MTL) and Arrow Lake (ARL), sported one design apiece, Panther Lake or PTL for short, comes in three varieties. The Panther Lake trio (Image credit: Intel) With Meteor Lake, Lunar Lake, and Arrow Lake, Intel created a single processor design and used binning strategies to create broad processor families from them. For example, one LNL chip can be found in nine different Core Ultra 200V CPUs. Not so with Panther Lake, because while binning will still be used to produce all the different models (i.e. some will have disabled cores, others will just be clocked lower), there are three chip designs in total.

The best way to view Xe3 is to think of it as being an all-around polish and spruce up of Xe2, but one which also lays the foundation for Intel's next generation of Arc graphics processors. This is possibly why Intel settled on using the product name of 'Arc B-series' for the new iGPU, rather than giving it an entirely new name, even though the GPU architecture itself is new. I chatted to a few of Intel's senior staff at the Technology Tour event about the nomenclature, and nobody had any better explanation for using B-series as the name, so that's what I'm sticking with.

    "body": "Battlefield 6 is just one day from launch and we've had a final spattering of updated system requirements. To be more specific, we've been told what the system requirements are to have an 'Ultra++' gameplay experience and, while these requirements are no joke, EA isn't saying these will net you a mere 60 fps at 4K. No, if you have the system components required for Ultra++ gameplay, this should apparently net you 144 fps on High settings at 4K with DLSS upscaling turned on, or 240+ fps on Ultra settings at 4K with DLSS Multi Frame Generation (MFG) turned on. Achieving these frame rates at these settings will require an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor. It's interesting to note, that a Core Ultra 9 285K should achieve what the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can here, given the latter is much better for gaming. But I suppose at 4K on high and ultra settings, the CPU won't play anywhere near as large a part as the GPU. The way EA has laid out the requirements might be a little confusing, but the general gist is actually incredibly positive: Not much is really required at all to get the game running well.

The Gboard Dial Version is a keyboard that eschews clicky-clacky keys for the burbling whir of nine rotary mechanisms instead (via The Verge ). For those unfamiliar with how this is supposed to work, rather than depressing a key, you jam your finger in the hole above the corresponding character you wish to type, drag the rotary wheel around as far as you can, and then release. There you go, you've 'typed' a single alphanumeric character—now on to the next one. It's a decidedly drawn-out process that would stop my hot takes long before they threaten to boil over, that's for sure. Oh, did I mention this concept keyboard comes with a stand that looks like an old-timey cradle for a landline phone? You can switch off your camera in video calls when you rest your mouse atop this cradle. That's not quite as dramatic as slamming the receiver down to end the call, but I can appreciate …",

Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit). Both feature damn near close enough the same form factor, and both are targeting the same budget-centric audience as well, and come with remarkably similar hardware underneath. On…",

Heart Machine doesn't go into detail about just what circumstances it's referring to, but it's not hard to deduce at least some of them. Unlike its previous games—Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash—which both enjoy popularity and acclaim, Hyper Light Breaker currently sits at a 64% Mixed user-review rating on Steam, and I suspect it will stay there or get worse with development coming to an end.

But those are just security updates; there will be no more feature updates for the OS and further support from developers for their apps will also slowly phase out, too. So, Windows 10 is effectively dunzo. And that fact has made me a little sadder than I thought it might. Not very sad—it's just an operating system—but a little. I was pondering why that is, because I tend to do just fine with Windows 11 and have used it pretty much since release. I think it's because of what it represents.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Food and videogames have gone hand in hand since Pac-Man gobbled down his first few cherries. In games, food can represent all sorts of things: a way to replenish health or stamina, a source of power-ups or buffs, or a skill to level up while cooking over a stove or campfire. A special meal can be a gift to bestow on an NPC you're in love with, a cultural milestone in a city builder, or even a way to assassinate someone—as with Oblivion's famous poisoned apples. Since every gamer is well-versed in the importance of food, I'm giving you a culinary challenge in today's quiz. Identify the 10 games below based only on a screenshot of their food. Time to see if you can cook! It's not as easy as it sounds—if you haven't played one of the games in the quiz, you probably won't recognize its edible items—but there should be enough context in the screenshots to give you some idea of what game it's from, even if you've never chowed down on it.

Rainbow Six Siege saw a big boost in player numbers earlier this year when the X update went live, from more than 66,000 concurrents on Steam on June 9, according to SteamDB , to more than 142,000 on June 10. But it's been a downhill ride ever since, and concurrent player counts now are actually lower than they were immediately prior to the free-to-play shift. User reviews have also taken a turn downward: The overall rating on Steam remains \"very positive\" but recent reviews are \"mixed,\" with an uptick in cheaters seemingly the most common complaint. Improving Rainbow Six Siege X's anti-cheat is the first priority for the dev team: Game director Joshua Mills and creative director Alex Karpazis wrote in today's update that \"our systems in Siege X did not keep pace with the surge of cheaters that followed the move to Free Access, though we have made some progress.\" The update doesn't go into d…",

As factions in RPGs often work, each vampire clan has a very different personality and goal and which one you choose will change your combat style and how other vamps treat you in conversations. There's a whole backlog of lore from the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop RPG including even more clans, sects, and other vampire hierarchy minutia, but I'll focus on what you need to know to choose which lunch table you're doing to sit at in Bloodlines 2 including combat style, abilities, and clan persona. The six playable clans in Bloodlines 2 are: Banu Haqim : the hunters and lawbringers Brujah : the rebellious brawlers Lasombra : the shadowy killers Toreador : the graceful seducers Tremere : the scholarly warlocks Ventrue : the aristocratic tyrants What does your clan choice change in Bloodlines 2? Abilities : You can unlock abilities from other clans, but they may cost more Ability Points if the Discipline they're from isn't one that your vamp's specializes in.

But when things start to get into the realm of cheating the system itself, and illicitly siphoning off money from the creator program, it turns out Epic's lawyers play a whole other ballgame. Fortnite has for many years hosted user-created experiences called islands, provides a suite of tools to make their creation as easy as possible, and then pays out money to the creators of the most popular maps. There are various metrics to determine payouts: session length, player count, and whether players go on to buy anything. This isn't chump change either: Epic says it pays out millions of dollars every year to community creators. So two miscreants took a look at that situation, and came up with a plan. Build some experiences, juice the player numbers through the roof with bots, and then sit back and profit. That's what Epic alleges in a new filing in Michigan against Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nas…",

You’re a tiny weakling moving forward through a hostile world. Where are you going? You just don’t know. Why are you there? It's a dream. Why do all these trauma-inducing monstrosities want to kill you? Because you’re there. These games are not works of narrative genius and that’s entirely to their credit. They’re cinematic platformers in the Inside mould, but they tell you nothing and rely entirely on implication. As far as we know, our freakish little protags have been on the run from diabolical terrors forever. In Little Nightmares 3 we can glean a lot about the sordid realities of the environments we move through, but we never learn with any certainty what that means to us, or how we fit into it.

PC Gamer: What was the top-level, guiding idea in designing Absolum's characters? Maxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead: As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them.

There are plenty of potential suspects you can point the finger at, and you have to choose one whether you've got damning evidence or not. Spoiler: you will never have damning evidence. Regardless of who you send under the headsman's axe, you'll always have a queasy feeling that they might not be the one who did it. In a chat with PCG at this year's GDC, Pentiment director Josh Sawyer said that's entirely the point. \"From the very beginning I said, 'I think that for this to be compelling in the way that I want it to be, there cannot be a right answer'\". In fact, it sounds like Sawyer himself doesn't have a clear culprit in mind for the game's evildoings. \"People on the team would ask me [who the culprit is], then people at Xbox would ask me, and I'm like, 'No!
