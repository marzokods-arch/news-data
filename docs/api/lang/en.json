The impeccable fusion between the organic and the electronic sounds, distinctive of the band led by vocalist Li Saumet, highlights the Caribbean drums, synthesizers and vallenato-style guitars converging at the same point.

Instead of glue, the hardware is held together with screws and gaskets, for easy service. Everything from the battery to the display is replaceable. Of all Google’s new hardware this season, could the breakout star be a lowly smartwatch? We maybe weren’t expecting a lot from the Pixel Watch 4 early on, when it sounded like it might be just a minor refresh of past generations. But as we started hearing more about the wearable we found a lot to start getting excited about, and ultimately came to appreciate it as the best-in-class model it really is. One of the big improvements Google’s been using to promote the Watch 4 is its reparability — a consideration that’s all too often overlooked for wearables. But did the company actually make real progress there, or have those claims been a little oversold? According to the latest iFixit teardown, the Pixel Watch 4 very much delivers when it comes to being able to service its hardware.",

Moving an eSIM from an iPhone to a Samsung one currently requires contacting your carrier. A One UI 8.5 beta is expected to kick off in November. Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

Despite this, phones in the US and in China will continue to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all models. If there’s something Samsung should be praised for, it is its grit and relentlessness. The company has experienced various setbacks but has recovered from them just as quickly. And it may now be working to remove another thorn by addressing longstanding issues with its Exynos lineup. The rumored Exynos 2600 is expected to be Samsung’s first chipset based on a 2nm process, and the company has already begun mass-producing it. While earlier reports speculated on the possibility of the chipset being used for one of the Galaxy S26 phones in certain regions, a recent report claims the strategy may already have been finalized.

This legendary feature has flown under my radar for many years, but I recently rediscovered it in my constant quest to streamline my smartphone setup. I’m so glad I tried it, as it has added significant utility to my minimalist, productivity-focused home screen. Let me offer a brief tutorial if you aren’t familiar with Edge Panel or have never used a Samsung phone. The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface. These devices offered a gimmicky tapered screen edge where icons were placed, effectively turning the side of the phone’s screen into a secondary display packed with shortcuts. The idea was solid, but I never appreciated the execution.",

Google is also testing new button configurations for its upcoming AI features that let you ask follow-up questions based on a translation. At some point or another, we have all relied on Google Translate to hold and continue conversations with people who don’t speak the same tongue as us. It’s truly a game-changer for international travel. Despite the slew of voice-based translation apps, or even dedicated devices , basic text translation — the app’s core functionality — might be what rescues you. To enhance this core functionality, Google is now testing a method to display translated text more prominently.

All P6 Pro variants feature a hybrid SIM/microSD slot with 5G data.

The Pro series marks a major leap for the lineup. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: SeeNebula TL;DR Anker’s new Nebula P1 projector is a budget-friendly alternative to the X1 Pro, featuring detachable wireless speakers. The projector offers 1080P resolution and runs Google TV for simple streaming access. While the speakers have a 20-hour battery, the projector itself requires an external power source. Portable projectors have long been a great space-saving alternative to a massive TV, but they often sacrifice audio quality to achieve their compact size. Anker’s Soundcore brand aims to solve that audio problem with its latest device, the Nebula P1 projector. The key feature of this projector is a pair of dual speakers that can be magnetically mounted to the projector or, crucially, detached and placed anywhere else in the room. This has the potential to bring you a wider soundstage and a more immersive sound experience, at least compared to most other projectors.",

When it comes to foldables, the hinge is one of the most important parts of the device. How the hinge is designed can dictate how the rest of the smartphone is made.

If the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are the future of wearable tech, that future’s going to be hard to fix. The teardown specialists at iFixit have taken apart Meta’s new $800 augmented reality specs and found cutting-edge optical engineering, but not much thought for repairability. According to iFixit’s teardown , every component of the glasses is sealed tight, with the entire frame glued and no easy way to replace the most obvious wear-out part: the battery. The teardown revealed a 960mWh battery, but the process of reaching it required specialist tools and a dose of luck to avoid damaging the delicate ribbon cable underneath. iFixit did say that “battery repair isn’t totally impossible here, provided you can get your hands on a replacement battery (which Meta hasn’t yet made available).”",

After all, Motorola’s flagship lineup already has an Edge over the others. The slim phone, likely called the Edge 70 globally, is set to arrive in China first as the Edge 70 Air . And while its decently sized battery and fast charging speeds have already been confirmed officially, a recent leak has spilled the beans on the rest of the specifications. The Edge 70 has already been listed for sale by the Polish e-commerce website X-Kom (via GSMArena ). The listing reveals the design of the Edge 70, along with different color options and a comprehensive list of specifications. It also echoes the officially revealed battery capacity and charging speeds.",

TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera.

This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much.

Google TV would run these checks if you haven’t used your remote in a while. The platform would then stop playing the channel if you don’t respond to the prompt. Some streaming services, like Netflix , offer a pop-up to check if you’re still watching a series. This is especially handy if you’ve fallen asleep. Now, we’ve discovered that Google TV itself could get a similar prompt. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
