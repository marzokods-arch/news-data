The demo video shows Mercedes’ Chief Software Officer, Magnus Östberg, and Google Cloud’s Head of Automotive, Steve Basra, take the Gemini-powered Mercedes CLA out for a drive. The duo interacts with Gemini in the car like one would with Gemini Live on their phones. The tech will arrive in the US before the end of the year, and the new Mercedes CLA will be the first production car to feature it. Just yesterday, we got an early look at Gemini inside Google Maps , and now, Google and Mercedes-Benz are giving us a first glimpse at how Gemini will soon be built directly into cars.

The projector offers 1080P resolution and runs Google TV for simple streaming access. While the speakers have a 20-hour battery, the projector itself requires an external power source. Portable projectors have long been a great space-saving alternative to a massive TV, but they often sacrifice audio quality to achieve their compact size. Anker’s Soundcore brand aims to solve that audio problem with its latest device, the Nebula P1 projector. The key feature of this projector is a pair of dual speakers that can be magnetically mounted to the projector or, crucially, detached and placed anywhere else in the room. This has the potential to bring you a wider soundstage and a more immersive sound experience, at least compared to most other projectors.",

The 960mWh battery could be replaced in theory, although Meta doesn’t sell spares, and the process is far from easy. A new geometric waveguide design addresses common AR issues, such as eye glow and rainbow artifacts. If the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are the future of wearable tech, that future’s going to be hard to fix. The teardown specialists at iFixit have taken apart Meta’s new $800 augmented reality specs and found cutting-edge optical engineering, but not much thought for repairability. According to iFixit’s teardown , every component of the glasses is sealed tight, with the entire frame glued and no easy way to replace the most obvious wear-out part: the battery. The teardown revealed a 960mWh battery, but the process of reaching it required specialist tools and a dose of luck to avoid damaging the delicate ribbon cable underneath. iFixit did say that “battery repair isn’t totally impossible here, provided you can get your hands on a replacement battery (which Meta hasn’t yet made available).”",

Update: October 9, 2025 (5:05 AM ET): Galaxy Techie on Twitter posted a series of screenshots highlighting this new call screening feature, which is apparently called Auto answer with AI . Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

We’ve just spotted early evidence of “Help me write” coming to the Docs Android app. Right now we don’t have much more than the appearance of that name, with the tool not yet functional. Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025.

This color has received a negative reception online along with claims that Samsung is copying Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro phones. We’d suggest you take this leak with a major helping of salt, though. Update: October 8, 2025 (9:22 AM ET): It sounds like the source of this image is more nebulous. Twitter user Najiulloh Berdiev , who claims to be the Redditor who first posted the image, stated that he took the picture from a “random X user” who had “many followers.” This tweet was in response to leaker Steve ‘OnLeaks’ Hemmerstoffer saying the image was likely an AI-generated picture. Either way, you should be very skeptical of this picture.",

The Galaxy S25 series could be among the earliest devices to be eligible for the beta. The final update may arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 early next year. After a laggard rollout of One UI 7 earlier in the year, Samsung turned the narrative in its favor with the speedy release of its One UI 8 interface . But even with One UI 8 in its initial phases, Samsung is gearing up to dish out another major update with a horde of visual and operational changes. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 is expected to arrive early next year, in line with the company’s usual launch cycle for the new Galaxy S series. However, the beta will kick off much sooner, and SamMobile indicates it could be as soon as next month.",

    "summary": "Could this mean emulation handhelds are finally ready to replace original 3DS hardware?",
    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",
