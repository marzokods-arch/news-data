According to leaker Ice Universe, the Galaxy S26 series is slated to feature a minimum of 12GB of memory across its different models.

The phone is apparently scheduled to launch on December 5, with sales kicking off immediately. You might have a tough time buying the phone due to its limited production run and Asia-only release. Samsung is expected to launch a so-called “TriFold” foldable phone before the end of the year, and the company has already shown off the phone’s design. Now, a new report has revealed a few more notable details. The Chosun Daily reports that the Galaxy Z TriFold will have a 5,600mAh battery. That would put it on par with HUAWEI’s existing “tri-fold” foldables, while also being larger than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . In saying so, this would be smaller than foldables like the HONOR Magic V5 (5,820mAh) and vivo X Fold 5 (6,000mAh). Nevertheless, previous leaks pointed to a smaller capacity than the Mate XT’s battery, so we’re glad to see Samsung apparently achieving parity with the first tri-fold on the market.",

Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this year, and it has an ultra-thin and light form factor following years of iterative designs. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 also delivered a thin form factor, but Samsung might go the extra mile with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The Bell (h/t: Jukanlosreve on Twitter) reports that Samsung wants to make the Galaxy Z Flip 8 much thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Flip 7. More specifically, the company is apparently aiming to reduce the Z Flip 8’s thickness and weight by more than 10%. This suggests that the upcoming Flip phone could be ~12mm thick when folded and weigh ~169 grams. However, the outlet added that it cannot rule out a further reduction in weight and thickness.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Disney and Google have been quarreling for the past two weeks over a YouTube TV deal that has fallen flat.

Google Maps is a mostly reliable and robust mapping application on Android, but its problems become apparent when used through Android Auto. Beyond its often questionable navigation suggestions, its UI frequently disrupts and distracts in an environment where information should be as legible as possible. This issue stems from Google’s reluctance to give drivers more UI control.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR The latest update to the Citron emulator now offers Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. This means your Snapdragon 8 Elite phone should see better performance and fewer bugs with the Switch emulator. This update also brings support for Windows on Arm devices as well as a variety of other optimizations and fixes. Citron is effectively a fork of the shuttered Yuzu Nintendo Switch emulator, and it received a major update earlier this year. Now, the Citron team has released another update, and there’s good news if you have a Snapdragon 8 Elite phone. The Citron team announced the availability of the v0.11.0 update this week, and the headline addition might be Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU support. The changelog specifically points to optimizations for the 8 Elite GPU, improved shader execution and compilation on Adreno GPUs in general, and an “optimized rendering pipeline” for high-end Android devices. These changes should result in better performance and fewer bugs if you have a Galaxy S25 series phone, OnePlus 13 , or another Snapdragon 8 Elite device.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google Maps is introducing a new Power Saving Mode, but the feature is exclusive to the Google Pixel 10 series. The mode displays a simplified, black-and-white layout on the Always-On Display to reduce power consumption. This can extend battery life by up to four hours by leveraging the AOD’s ultra-low-power display state. Update: November 12, 2025 (12:07 AM ET): We noted in our original article that the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps might work for walking or using two-wheeler directions. However, Google’s support page now makes it clear that the feature is only available in driving mode and doesn’t support other travel modes, such as walking or biking navigation. Once you start navigating, you can view a power-saving version of the navigation map right on your lock screen by pressing your phone’s power button. To exit this mode, simply tap the screen or press the power button again. If you want to return to the power-saving navigation view, just press the power button once more.",

While it’s more affordable than last year’s Cine Play 1, it’s still firmly in premium territory, starting at roughly US $1,670 for the base model or around US $1,950 with the optional stand bundle. The Cine Play 1 Plus delivers 3,500 lumens of brightness and claims 110% coverage of the BT.2020 color gamut, promising highly vivid colors. Its RGB laser light source is rated for approximately 25,000 hours, and the projector supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ for dynamic range playback.

Phones that “cheat” at benchmarks by unthrottling performance for specific apps can often be tricked by a simple name-change. This approach isn’t without its trade-offs, and not all phones will respond the same. Video game emulation has been pushing boundaries for decades, and it’s just as exciting to see a PlayStation 4 being emulated in 2025 as it was to first witness GameBoy games running on a 486. Because emulators have to do just so much computation to effectively simulate one computer inside another, we regularly see emulation targets lagging a generation or two behind the systems we’re running these apps on. But for Android-based emulators in particular, it turns out there’s a little trick that some use to squeeze more performance out of your device than might be available to the average app. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Subscribers have been offered a $20 credit for the missing channels, and they remain unavailable. Now a report specifically identifies ESPN pricing as the hurdle that’s holding up negotiations. YouTube TV and Disney are now solidly into week two of failing to work out a new coverage deal, with the consequence that the latter’s channel properties have gone dark on the former’s streaming service. The fallout’s been spreading to other streaming solutions, too, and although subscribers have been offered a $20 credit , what they really want are their channels back. As we wait to see if some compromise can be made, we’re getting a little new insight into what could be the core sticking point that’s in the way of an easy solution.

As opposed to other pass types — store loyalty cards or concert tickets, for example — private passes come with extra security features meant to help keep critical information attached to documents like government IDs or health insurance cards private. One of those security features is that private passes can only exist on a single device at one time, but it looks like that could be changing. Experimenting with the latest version of Google Play services, we spotted code that indicates Google Wallet might soon incorporate features that will allow users to transfer private passes between devices, or even sync them between multiple concurrent devices.",

One of the biggest roadblocks is the absence of proper software support, as Android still lacks a fully functional desktop mode. Google’s Chrome OS has aged better than most PC users would have anticipated, but its long run is nearing its end. Google has already confirmed its plans to merge Chrome OS with Android , and the driver behind this shift is the need to manage engineering resources more effectively and compete with Apple . While this is expected to be a multi-year transition, we may see actual laptops — not flagship tablets capable of serving as laptop replacements — running Android soon. Tech analyst known as @Jukanlosreve on X recently shared a rumor about Qualcomm testing Android 16 for its Snapdragon X series chips. What makes the development interesting is that while the Snapdragon X, X Plus, and X Elite chipsets feature an Arm64 architecture, similar to those found in phone chips, Qualcomm specifically designates them for thin and light laptops.

Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept.

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better. This has opened the door for the iPhone 17 Pro to make an impression on me. So, I swapped to iOS for a month, and here’s how it went.",

And unless you’re at odds with AI and uphold that it cannot replace true art, you’re likely to have participated in some of these trends yourself. To make things easier for people who create a large number of images, Google has recently introduced a “My Stuff” section in the Gemini on Android. It stores all your generated images in one place.

A cybersecurity firm said the hackers initially compromised devices by sending malicious files via KakaoTalk. It’s recommended that you enable two-factor authentication on your Google account and regularly change your password. It’s not uncommon for hackers to turn your favorite apps and services against you, and it turns out cybercriminals are abusing Google Find Hub to remotely track and wipe victims’ Android phones and tablets. Security firm Genians (h/t: Bleeping Computer ) reports that North Korean state-backed hackers were compromising victims’ Android devices by using malicious files sent via the KakaoTalk chat app. The malicious scripts would then lie dormant on a user’s device, while also installing additional scripts to monitor and control the system. This way, the cybercriminals are able to harvest credentials for a variety of accounts and services.",

The timing may just align with T-Mobile’s usual pre–holiday sales prep, discussing promotions, goals, or new initiatives like the T-Mobile credit card or T-Life rollout. Earlier this week, there were rumors that Verizon might be announcing some big changes later this month, as talks of potential layoffs are in the air. It’s still unclear if there’s any real substance to the claims, but it seems that they aren’t the only carrier with rumored changes ahead. As first reported by Visible-Bonus-9387 via Reddit , it seems T-Mobile stores around the country are set for a big meeting on November 23. According to the employee, it will be about “something big”.
