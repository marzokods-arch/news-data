When the latest frames where published Friday, Jan. 9, Dean’s sophomore album The Art Of Loving (via Universal) led the way for the sixth non-consecutive week, while “Man I Need” tops the singles tally for the eighth consecutive week. Ninajirachi (real name: Nina Wilson) finished 2025 in a flurry, nabbing awards left and right for her debut album I Love My Computer (NLV Records). The new year brings a new high for the collection, as it vaults 36-12, besting its previous peak of No. 18 from last August. I Love My Computer is the nation’s best-seller on vinyl this week, and it’s the highest-ranked of six homegrown titles on the ARIA Albums Chart. Ninajirachi’s impressive haul on the awards circuit include three ARIA Awards, the Australian Music Prize, the J Awards for Australian album of the year and the inaugural NSW Music Prize for breakthrough artist of the year.

    "body": "TL;DR We’ve managed to enable the upcoming “My Calling Card” feature in Google’s Phone app. You can now create your own Calling Card, choose a photo, customize fonts, and control who sees it. If someone hasn’t customized your card already, they’ll see your version when you call. Google introduced Calling Cards for Android last year. Just like iOS, Calling Card on Android lets you customize how incoming calls from friends and family appear on your phone. It’s a great feature, but has been lacking something big Apple offers with Contact Posters on iPhones since the feature came around. While you can customize how other people’s Calling Cards look on your device, you can’t control how your own Calling Card appears when calling other people. In October, we reported that Google is about to fix this limitation. We found that Google is working on a new “My calling card” option inside the Phone by Google app to allow you to set up your own Calling Card that would appear for other users when you call them. At the time, the setting existed, but it didn’t actually do anything. Now, we can show you exactly how you’ll be able to set up your own calling card.",

Unsurprisingly, T-Mobile has clarified plans to appeal the decisions it disagrees with. It’s no secret that AT&amp;T and T-Mobile’s rivalry has intensified significantly over the last half year or so. AT&amp;T not only unveiled an ad campaign around T-Mobile’s so-called Un-Truths late last year, but it also sued its rival over T-Mobile’s new Switching tool, and it even brought complaints of false advertising to the National Advertising Division (NAD). The NAD has now officially responded to the complaints, agreeing that T-Mobile might have gone a bit too far with some of its recent claims. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

That idea has been around for years on paper, but the reality is that it has taken much longer for robot mowers to live up to that hands-off ideal. The problem hasn’t been power or even cutting ability. Modern robotic mowers are more than capable of trimming grass cleanly and consistently. Where things have historically fallen apart is navigation. A mower that can’t reliably understand where it is or where to go will always need more babysitting than most people expect from an “autonomous” machine.",

With Android 16 QPR2 , which rolled out last month, Google introduced alerts every time your phone automatically switches to a new timezone .

Instead, it took a few months and a couple of quarterly updates, but it’s obvious to me now that Android 16 is the best Android version we’ve had in many years.",

Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

Compared to Clicks’ keyboard cases , the Power Keyboard has a couple of key benefits: 1) You can attach and remove the Clicks Power Keyboard much more easily than a case, and 2) it allows the keyboard to be attach to any phone that has magnets, whether built into it or via a compatible case.",

Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

You’ll be able to add AI-generated weather effects to your lock screen wallpaper based on local weather conditions. Effects like rain or snowfall realistically move behind visible objects or people, rather than simply sitting on top of the wallpaper image. Smartphone brands have been paying extra attention to the lock screen lately, treating it as more than just a place to check notifications or check the time. From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update looks set to continue that trend with a new weather-driven feature that adds a bit of magic to your wallpaper, and closely mirrors a similar idea Google already offers on Pixel phones.

Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees.

Google Pixel Watch 4: The best smartwatch for Android users When Google first entered the smartwatch space, the Pixel Watch line took a few generations to find its footing. The Pixel Watch 4 absolutely delivers. To start, the newest model offers the most complete Wear OS experience yet, pairing Google’s Tensor G4 chipset with the powerful Wear OS platform for faster performance, smoother navigation, and stronger integration across the Pixel ecosystem.",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Hindy / Android Authority TL;DR Google Play Store is working on a “Try before you buy” feature that allows users to play premium games for a set duration at no cost. Users can purchase the full game experience once their trial ends, and their progress will be carried over. The feature is likely to be an opt-in tool for game developers, helping them attract users who are hesitant about upfront costs. The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it. Google may be looking to address this issue, as the Play Store could soon offer a new “Try before you buy” feature for premium games.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section.

Kepler’s Supernova Remnant, named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was first spotted in the night sky in 1604. Today, astronomers know that a white dwarf star exploded when it exceeded a critical mass, after pulling material from a companion star, or merging with another white dwarf. This kind of supernova is known as a Type Ia, and scientists use it to measure the expansion of the universe. Supernova remnants, the debris fields left behind after a stellar explosion, of…",

    "body": "The operating system that powers every Android phone and tablet on the market is based on AOSP , short for the Android Open Source Project. Google develops and releases AOSP under the permissive Apache 2.0 License, which allows any developer to use, modify, and distribute their own operating systems based on the project without paying fees or releasing their own modified source code. Since beginning the project, Google released the source code for nearly every new version of Android for mobile devices, typically doing so within days of rolling out the corresponding update to its own Pixel mobile devices. Starting this year, however, Google is making a major change to its release schedule for Android source code drops: AOSP sources will only be released twice a year. Google told Android Authority that, effective 2026, Google will publish new source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4. The reason is to ensure platform stability for the Android ecosystem and better align with Android’s trunk-stable development model . Developers navigating to source.android.com today will see a banner confirming the change that reads as follows:",
