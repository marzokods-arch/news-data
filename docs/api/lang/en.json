Google knows that smartphones don’t exist in a world by themselves, and over the years the company’s shown its willingness to promote both Android itself and Pixel devices with the help of some timely media tie-ins. Maybe that means showing off its AR tech with some help from The Mandalorian, or using the cameras on Pixel phones to record the highlights from the NBA All-Star Weekend.

As the chorus of “Melt!,” a track from her 2020 LP Inner Song , began to descend, Owens would routinely point at one bright-eyed audience member on the barrier and cry out: “Girls love techno!” The floor would erupt in response. “People felt part of a special moment each time I did that,” she recalls, speaking to Billboard U.K. over Zoom from her grandparents’ home on the north Welsh coast, where she is recuperating from a busy festival season. “The idea of community is really important to me – I want to be able to live it out in …",

Samsung recently launched its Galaxy XR headset, but that’s not the only extended reality (XR) product we can expect from the company. Since 2024, it has been known that Samsung is also working on smart glasses that carry the codename “Haean.” A new report provides a few new details about Samsung’s next XR device.

A new analysis of data from NASA’s Cassini mission found evidence of previously undetected organic compounds in a plume of ice particles ejected from the ocean that lies under the frozen shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Researchers spotted not only molecules they’ve found before but also new ones that lay a potential path to chemical or biochemical activity. The ice grains studied were collected just 13 miles (21 kilometers) from the moon’s surface and mark the first time scientists have observed this diversity of organics in fresh particles ejected from the subsurface water of Enceladus. Published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, the findings signal an important step toward confirming active organic chemistry below the moon’s surface.

It uses instant AI 2D-to-3D conversion for movies, photos, and retro games, plus native 3D in supported games and media. The Kickstarter is now live, with early-bird pricing starting at $1,499. The first units ship in December. It’s been more than 15 years since James Cameron’s Avatar smashed box office records with its gorgeous 3D visuals, but since then, the technology has largely struggled to find an audience. The Nintendo 3DS brought an early version of the tech to video games, but a new gaming handheld is now set to revive, and modernize, the 3D viewing experience for gaming. The Abxylute 3D One, which launched today on Kickstarter , is the first Windows gaming handheld to feature glasses-free 3D. That means you can enjoy games, movies, photos, and more in full 3D, without the goofy glasses. It was first teased as the “ Sunday Dragon ” at CES 2025, where it was billed as a prototype collaboration between Intel and Tencent before Abxylute picked up the design.",

The flagship model, Gemini 3 Pro , replaces the 2.5 Pro model that was first unveiled in March 2025. Google’s announcement comes hot on the heels of OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 model, which only released a week ago for all ChatGPT users. Gemini 3 boasts better reasoning and multimodal capabilities. In fact, Google’s testing indicates that the new model beats OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 in almost every single AI intelligence benchmark. It’s also vastly better at coding as my colleague Mishaal showcased by building entire Android apps in little time.",

The two biggest flavors, Google’s Material 3 Expressive and One UI 8, couldn’t be more different. Samsung overhauled its operating system with One UI 7, opting for a subtle and iOS-like appearance that extends into One UI 8 .

Those big windows-slash-doors bring a level of luminosity we’d never experienced in our previous rental, especially during the gloomy winter months, but we soon discovered that they also had a potential disadvantage: insulation. Even though all of these are double-glazed and seem well-insulated, they’re still glass, which will always be less efficient than a properly insulated wall. These French doors seemed like the weakest link in our new home’s thermal isolation and the biggest culprit in our high energy bills last January and February. But I couldn’t really prove it. As winter time rolls around again, I’ve been wanting to get to the bottom of this. So I started making complicated plans with infrared thermometers, thermal cameras, and/or Zigbee sensors, until I came across a Reddit thread where people were explaining how they were using the Pixel Pro’s built-in temperature sensor to check their home’s insulation, and it was my aha moment.

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a new split-screen functionality for Gemini. This would allow Gemini to read the contents of other apps open in split-screen mode without an overlay or Gemini Live. The feature may be limited to book-style foldabes or tablets. Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini overlays have been two remarkable ways to let Gemini view content from other apps. But their application remains limited since the overlay closes as soon as we switch back to the other app. The other alternative is to share your screen with Gemini Live , but that may not match the regular interface in terms of functionality. Now, Google may be working to partially solve that by allowing Gemini to interpret another app’s content, though the application may be limited to a specific set of devices.

While Rebble and Core Devices had initially agreed to work together, the former now claims to disagree over the terms. Rebble alleges that Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, could build a “walled garden,” restricting further open-source app development. Update: Nov 19, 2025 (1:55 AM ET): Eric Migicovsky responded with a blog explaining his stance. He says while the agreement between Rebble and Core includes a licensing fee of $0.20 per user per month, Rebble assert a 100% claim on its app store data. He counter-accused Pebble of “attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016,” and added he’s “working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source.”",

Mobile phone thefts, usually snatch-and-grabs, are rising, but thieves reportedly prefer iPhones due to their enhanced resale value. Since thieves don’t want your Samsung Galaxy phone, you might get to keep it in the event of a robbery. It’s safe to say that, in 2025, the notion that Android phones are cheaper than iPhones simply isn’t true. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and that’s without getting into the foldable phone market, where Samsung charges $2,000 for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z TriFold could hit the $3,000 mark . Phone thieves apparently didn’t get the memo. Smartphone theft is rampant in the London, with the UK’s Metropolitan Police reporting 117,211 mobile phone thefts in the city in 2024 alone. While the Metropolitan Police doesn’t track theft data by smartphone brand, it appears thieves have a preference.

Google parent company Alphabet’s stock price has doubled this year as Google has built out AI efforts. The breakneck pace of investment in companies developing AI tech over the past few years has many onlookers convinced we’re currently in an AI bubble. Sundar Pichai knows the situation is serious: when the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune,” the Google CEO told the BBC . In an interview with the BBC at Google’s headquarters in California, Pichai drew parallels between today’s AI market and the 1990s dot-com boom, during which investment in internet startups reached a fever pitch before a crash saw tech firms lose trillions in market cap and shed tens of thousands of jobs. Back then, “There was clearly a lot of excess investment,” Pichai said, “but none of us would question whether the internet was profound.” Pichai said AI investment is in a similar spot today.",

For one, my job relies on technology and communication, and I can’t exactly turn off the dial on that. Moreover, most of us cannot simply retreat from the world.

DJI, a household name for drone and action cameras, has announced its newest 4K action camera for the global markets. The Osmo Action 6 introduces a few changes over the Osmo 5 Pro, and two of those changes stand out in particular. First, the Action 6 features a new 1/1.1-inch sensor, as opposed to the 1/1.3-inch sensor found on the Action 5 Pro and the Action 4. Despite the minor increase in sensor size, the more significant change is the shape. Action 6 now uses a square CMOS sensor, rather than a traditional one with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and that allows for more flexibility in terms of shooting.

I’ve carried these in backpacks through busy days, in my pockets while traveling, and in my rental car while driving around.

Last week, OnePlus unveiled its latest top-tier phone, the OnePlus 15 , but skipped a crucial element. Over the past few years, the company’s flagships have been accompanied by less premium but more value-for-money flagship killers, denoted by an “R” suffix. Naturally, we were also expecting the OnePlus 15R at the event last week. However, OnePlus made no mention of the phone, besides briefly stating it would be “coming soon.” Fortunately, the company has now begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, which is likely to raise our expectations for a launch soon. OnePlus’ sites for the UK and India have already begun teasing the OnePlus 15R, showcasing a silhouette of the upcoming phone. In the teaser, it can be seen in two colors: dark gray and metallic green.

The new ad once again features Billy Bob Thornton and has a somewhat similar vibe to AT&amp;T’s earlier ad. The recent rivalry began when AT&amp;T released an ad accusing T-Mobile of “Un-Truths,” allegedly misusing NAD materials in the process, which led to requests for a takedown of the ad, which AT&amp;T is aiming ot fight in court. The battle between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile continues, as the latter has released a new ad poking fun at AT&amp;T. The ad aired on live TV over the weekend, though T-Mobile provided us a copy (above). Billy Bob Thornton is back once again, this time defending the Un-Carrier and what it says are unfounded claims about its performance. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Samsung Members is an app that offers a grab-bag of functionality to Galaxy device users, from support and diagnostics to “exclusive perks” like device discounts.

A post by user GaryB82 on the US Samsung Community forums details the message that’s been circulating. In the scam, an account posing as an official Samsung channel says that the recipient’s account urgently needs “verification,” directing the user to click a link and supply personal info. Failure to comply, the message says, comes with a fine. It might go without saying, but if you’ve seen received of these messages, do not click the link.",
