While the change primarily affected Pixel users, Google is now testing a reversal of the original design. With the latest Android Canary build, Google is testing the same placement for the Live Caption toggle as before the change last year. Android’s Live Caption is a useful accessibility feature that enables subtitles for virtually any audio playing on your phone or tablet. It even works when the device’s volume is turned down to zero, allowing you to experience sound — while also emphasizing expressions — without needing to raise the volume. Its placement right under the volume slider makes it easy to access, unless you’re using a Pixel device, where accessing the toggle takes an additional step. Google now appears to realize that placement may not be intuitive and is working to improve it. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Update: September 26, 2025 (1:15 AM ET): Qualcomm has now confirmed some details about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. The company revealed to journalists, including Android Authority , that the chip has a 3nm TSMC design with custom Oryon CPU cores (3.8GHz Prime core and 3.32GHz Performance cores). The language suggests we’re looking at a 1+7 CPU layout as opposed to the 8 Elite family’s 2+6 setup. Otherwise, the company said this chip has a “next-gen” Adreno GPU, a “powerful” NPU, and a “superior AI-ISP powered camera.” That doesn’t tell us much, so we’re still keen to see exactly what this chipset is capable of compared to its Elite stablemates.",

At the time, it was unknown when the feature would be available. Now it appears Samsung is ready to start rolling it out. Home to Car In a blog post , Samsung announced it is finally launching “Home to Car.” This feature will allow SmartThings users to check on the status of their vehicle through the app. You’ll also have control over functions, like the air conditioning, door locks, engine start, and so on. On top of that, you’ll even be able to set up automated routines. For example, you could set it up so that your engine starts and the air conditioning turns on when you lock the door to your smart home .",

The service is reportedly frustrated with the high rates it pays, and wants to leverage its size for a better deal. If nothing is worked out by October, viewers face the proposition of channel blackouts. Is there anything more pathetic than when big companies take their petty spats public? You’d think that institutions with multi-billion-dollar valuations would be able to negotiate arrangements between themselves professionally (and behind closed doors, most likely), but sometimes us end users get unceremoniously pulled into the fights. That happens far too often with cable companies temporarily dropping channels after failing to work out deals, and right now we’re worried that YouTube TV could be headed for just that kind of confrontation. According to CNBC’s Alex Sherman, YouTube’s deal to carry NBCUniversal is expiring at the end of the month, and as of right now a smooth renewal doesn’t sound particularly guaranteed.",

A jailbreak specialist says the e-books are now tied to a hidden “account secret” only accessible with a previously jailbroken device. It follows earlier restrictions like removing USB transfers and blocking downloads on older versions of the Kindle Android app. Amazon just rolled out a change to its Kindle e-readers that could frustrate anyone who likes to keep permanent copies of their e-books . The newest firmware update, version 5.18.5, strengthens Amazon’s Digital Rights Management (DRM) — the copy-protection system that prevents people from freely backing up or transferring Kindle books. Goodereader reported the change, citing a post on the Mobileread forum that the publication identified as from one of the lead developers of a jailbreak method. In the poster’s explanation, they said the new system applies fresh encryption to any newly downloaded e-books, regardless of when they were originally purchased or published. Books where the publisher has opted out of copy-protection are not affected.",

Android also has some useful manual tools, like Remote Lock, and that one’s finally getting an important upgrade. Remote Lock was built to address an important need: Someone steals your device, but you don’t immediately have access to another device where you’re signed into your account to use the Find Hub and its security tools.

American Express recently overhauled its high-end Platinum credit card, and in the process, it increased the already hefty annual fee from $695 up to an eye-watering $895. American Express justified the higher price with new perks, such as a $400 Resy credit and a $200 Oura Ring credit, but there’s another new feature that topples all of them. If and only if you have the new $895/year Amex Platinum card — like yours truly does — you’ll now unlock something completely unheard of: a dark mode for Amex’s mobile app.",

There are three areas of focus: reducing AI slop, stopping impersonation, and disclosing whether AI was used to make a track. The music spam filter will be released this fall. AI music creators, like Suno AI , are on the rise. And with that surge in popularity, streaming services, like Spotify, are getting bogged down by increasing levels of AI-generated content. Whether the music is passible or just pure spam, the presence of this content is having an effect on the experience. Now Spotify is starting to take steps to address the problem. Today, Spotify announced it is rolling out new policies and tools to fight off spammy AI content. This initiative is focusing on three areas of concern: AI slop, impersonation, and disclosure of AI use. According to the company, the goal is to provide “listeners with greater transparency about the music they hear” and to protect artists from spam, impersonation, and deception.",

Apple maintains its anodization process exceeds industry standards. Apple’s latest phones hit store shelves last week, and the iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max are all available for purchase right now. The iPhone 17 series features some striking new designs, but early testing has revealed an issue: several of the new models seem especially prone to scratching in certain areas. Apple’s now acknowledged the problem, but its response probably won’t do much to soothe affected buyers. About five minutes into JerryRigEverything ‘s iPhone 17 Pro durability test video, the channel’s Zack Nelson clearly demonstrates the issue. While the 17 Pro’s anodized aluminum finish is mostly able to resist scratching when rubbed with a coin, the finish gives way around the sharp edges of the phone’s new camera plateau. Zack says this is down to a confluence of thin anodization applied over a sharp corner, making for an especially vulnerable finish in that area.",

Imagine that you’re in the market for a new vehicle. Your goal is to take your family on long road trips, exploring national parks and camping under the stars. You need space for people, beds, and maybe even a small kitchenette. A tricked-out Sprinter camper van seems like the perfect solution, which would cost you about $150,000. Unfortunately, your friend, a die-hard car enthusiast, scoffs at your choice. “A Sprinter van?

A few hours later, as I was browsing Twitter/X, I came across a viral post by one of the developers who worked on the original Space Cadet Windows port from the original Full Tilt! Pinball title. It felt like a sign that I should break my no-games-on-my-phone rule and install this oldie but goodie. I grabbed the Space Cadet Pinball APK , installed it, and was immediately taken back in time to 1999, sitting in front of my first PC, starting Windows 98, and discovering it came with a few games pre-installed. 3D Pinball Space Cadet was one of those games, and it quickly became my go-to time-waster during school holidays and on weekends. Now, more than 25 years later, would I still like it?",

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google is testing a “More like this” feature to search similar-looking images. The results display identical images in a grid, allowing you to easily sort or delete pictures. While results aren’t very accurate currently, we can expect them to mature as the feature nears its release. For most Android users, Google Photos is a great way to store and share photos across multiple devices. However, it also becomes the default dumping ground for unnecessary or unpicturesque, yet still useful, images, which can compound if you tend to keep automatic backups turned on. Finding those images can be challenging, especially if you don’t own a Pixel, which makes the process easier with the Pixel Screenshots app. Thankfully, that may be alleviated to some degree with an upcoming feature update.

Last month, Google rolled out Nano Banana , its newest AI-powered image editing tool, inside the Gemini app. Since then, it’s sparked viral trends online, from turning selfies into 3D figurines to erasing fences from photos, generating images from scratch, adding scenic backdrops, and even experimenting with new looks. The best thing about Nano Banana is that it isn’t locked behind a paywall. It’s available in every country, across personal, work, and paid versions of Gemini, so just about anyone can try it out. Now, it seems Google is preparing to bring the magic of Nano Banana to an even wider audience by building it directly into Google Photos.

Most recently, those efforts have taken the form of attempts to verify users’ ages, and right now it looks like enforcement is stepping up. Google announced this past summer that it would start targeting US YouTube viewers with these age checks , using multiple data points to try to automatically characterize users based on things like viewing history.

Naturally, that means we’re also looking forward to the next big thing in mobile connectivity: 6G. Yesterday, at the company’s annual Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gave a bit of a status update on that front: early 6G devices are indeed in the works, but we’ve still got a considerable wait ahead of us. Talking up Qualcomm’s 6G plans on stage, Amon told a Snapdragon Summit audience that we can expect 6G-equipped “pre-commercial devices coming as early as 2028.” That’s some serious hedging; “pre-commercial devices” are, of course, not meant for general consumers, and Amon’s “as early as” framing leaves wiggle room for those cutting edge devices to land after 2028, as well.",

    "body": "Android phones are wonderful gadgets that can do pretty much anything, but their screens are too small for some tasks. That’s why tablets make for great secondary devices, but choosing the right one can be a challenge. For years, I’ve been on the “bigger is better” train, using Android tablets with 11-inch or larger screens. But after recently trying a smaller, iPad Mini-sized Android tablet, I’ve started to question why I ever liked the larger models in the first place. The appeal of larger Android tablets is obvious: their large, vibrant screens make watching videos and playing games incredibly immersive. Media consumption is their forte, and no other product category does it better. However, few people want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just for media, which is why so many companies try to position their tablets as laptop replacements. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things. The problem, though, is that Android tablets all suck at doing laptop-like things.

For me, the best Android phones are the ones that not only lack any noticeable flaws but also have a unique hook that makes them special, whether it’s a clever AI feature or new hardware used in an interesting way. Xiaomi’s T series has generally ticked the right boxes for what makes a good smartphone, but it’s always lacked that one extra feature to make it exciting. The new Xiaomi 15T is a great device with solid all-around specs and some welcome generational improvements, like a better telephoto lens, a bigger battery, and a larger display. However, it also breaks from the T series mold by bringing a seldom-seen feature to mobile devices: an offline communication mode that effectively turns your phone into a walkie-talkie.",

I love the idea of my phone greeting me with immediately relevant information before I start my day. And, as it’s made by Google, I could expect all the relevant content from my many Google apps and services to be included, right? Not quite. The early version of Daily Hub was as useful as a wet piece of toast. As a result, the company quickly yanked it to polish it up a bit. This loss didn’t affect me too severely — I don’t own a Pixel 10, but I craved a similar feature, albeit with a few more customizations. So, naturally, to achieve my vision, I turned to Google’s generative AI for assistance. Could I use Gemini to serve me with a Daily Hub equivalent? I gave this idea a whack, and here are my findings.",

The issue is not the return to aluminum as a build material, but a design flaw in the sharp-edged camera plateau. This “spalling” damage should serve as a warning to Android brands who might try to copy the design. Apple recently launched the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air . While the Air is grabbing a lot of headlines for its slim physique, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are also in the news for their “scratchgate” controversy . Demo units in Apple Stores worldwide have been spotted with scratches on the phone’s frame. Now, we better understand what’s happening with the iPhone 17 Pro’s scratch resistance, and why Android brands should not copy the large camera plateau. iFixit tore down the iPhone 17 Pro to peek at its internals, but it also spent some time trying to scratch the phone and put it under a microscope.",

Not all users are eligible; the discount offer may be US-exclusive. Google jacked up the prices of its Nest Aware subscriptions in July, bumping fees by 25 to 33% on both monthly and annual plans. The move prompted backlash online, with commenters around the internet (including here on Android Authority) declaring that they canceled their service or planned to in response to the hikes. Now, though, you might be able to hang onto your subscription a little longer without overpaying. As reported by 9to5Google , Google’s trying to appease disgruntled subscribers. Some users who attempt to cancel their Nest Aware plans are being offered significant discounts to keep their subscriptions active.",
