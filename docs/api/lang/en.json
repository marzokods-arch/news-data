The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

It’s always been about respecting the music and trusting the process.” In 2025, Sean put that skill set on full display &#8212; flexing his lyrical muscles across more than 20 features, and reaffirming why his Detroit-bred motor still runs at championship speed. From lyrical sparring matches with Dave East and Russ to a heartfelt nod to childhood icon Will Smith, Sean’s elastic wordplay and technical dexterity continue to keep listeners locked in, anticipating his next verse. “Early in my career, it was always a dream to work with Nas, Eminem, Jay-Z, Ye and Wayne,” Sean says. “I’ve been fortunate enough to check most of those off — …",

But a music career isn’t only about music — it’s about the visual execution too. And though the age-old saying “don’t judge a book by its cover” is generally true, an album cover can play a big role in making it memorable. For Swift, a handful of her biggest albums feature some of the most memorable art. When 1989 was released in 2014, for example, everyone from Swifties to casual listeners attempted their re-creations of the iconic half-face Polaroid cover. And that album went on to win album of the year at the Grammys. At the same time, not all hit covers are hit albums, and vice versa. So Billboard decided to rank each of the pop star’s covers since her debut in 2006. Now, let&#8217;s be clear: This list is only taking album artwork into account – not the merit of the music itself.

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

AYANEO confirmed the delay in a new Indiegogo update posted today.

As color E Ink continues to try to escape the shadow of e-readers , the PicPak is the latest attempt to see where else the technology can go. The tiny E Ink display acts as a trendy, miniature digital picture frame you can fill up and forget about, thanks to extended battery life and storage for more than 500 images. In other words, it may just be the low-maintenance answer to the constant question of what to do with all the photos sitting in your camera roll.

New details reveal what makes the device stand out and help clarify its place in the current market. Rather than competing head-on with minimalist E-Ink tablets or fully fledged tablets, it’s designed to be faster and more flexible than E-Ink, but still easier on the eyes than a typical LCD slate. At the center, the device’s 11.5-inch NXTPAPER Pure display uses a 3:2 aspect ratio with a 2200 × 1440 resolution. It supports 16.7 million colors, reaches 300 nits of typical brightness, and refreshes at up to 120Hz, giving it a clear responsiveness advantage over E-Ink alternatives.

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit.

Last year, at CES 2025, we saw Roborock push the limits on what we’ve come to expect from robot vacuum hardware with the reveal of the Saros Z70 and its articulated arm for picking up small items.

These upgrades allow Bixby to access real-time information from the web and offer more relevant and detailed responses. The upgrade appears to be a part of the One UI 8.5 beta. Even after years of being outclassed by other rivals, Samsung refuses to give up on its smart assistant, Bixby . Now that all smart assistants are being upgraded with AI, Samsung has similar expectations for Bixby, too. But instead of developing a solution in-house, the tech giant is partnering with an OpenAI rival to execute complex commands given to Bixby, in a similar fashion to how Apple has integrated ChatGPT into Siri . Samsung has seemingly begun experimenting with Bixby powered by Perplexity AI, a ChatGPT rival that takes a research-first approach, accessing the web and blending other LLMs for responses. This integration was first mentioned last month by a leaker and now appears to be taking form. Based on a screenshot shared by user @achultra on X (via SammyGuru ), Bixby appears to be delivering some responses powered by Perplexity.",

Scott Brown / Android Authority While OnePlus may not be a household name in the US, it remains a strong option if you want something a little less mainstream than a typical Apple, Samsung, or Google device. The OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 15R might be the latest models from the company, but that doesn’t necessarily make them the best . If you prefer classic OnePlus design elements or are simply looking to save money, there are still plenty of older OnePlus devices worth considering, even as we head into 2026. Of course, not all older OnePlus phones are still worth your time. For example, you’re almost always better off with either a new mid-range Nord device over a used one. Some OnePlus phones are also too old to be suitable for serious use due to potential security issues. To make things easier, I’ve gathered up a list of some of the best OnePlus phones worth buying, even if they are no longer the latest and greatest.",

Samsung quietly listed the Exynos Modem 5410 on its website (h/t: r/Android ), and a leaker previously claimed that this will be the modem in all Exynos-powered Galaxy S26 variants.

That relic of a device that’s gathering dust in your drawer might still have a lease of life in it yet. Google officially stopped updating the Pixel 4 back in 2022, but the phone is now getting Android 16 anyway — just not from Google. As spotted by Android Police, the LineageOS team has officially added support for the Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL as part of LineageOS 23 . The Pixel 4a, 4a 5G, Pixel 5, and Pixel 5a are also now supported. That’s the project’s Android 16-based release, and the “official” status means the maintainers consider it stable enough for everyday use, with core features working as expected.",

OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

That’s pretty long range, and as a very, very, very amateur astronomer, I wondered whether OPPO’s lens kit would be a gateway to some even more amateur astrophotography. Given the rise of brilliant camera phones , computational photography, and dedicated astrophotography modes, I set out to answer whether smartphones are finally catching up to entry-level telescopes for casual sky-watching. Before I braced myself for the cold, I did some quick math to set my expectations. “My Newtonian telescope has a 750 mm focal length, just bright enough to make out nebulae and galaxies on a dark night, such as Andromeda, with a 28mm lens (27x magnification).",

So when I came across the Beryl AX — a Wi-Fi router claiming to disrupt the status quo on both, price and features — it piqued my interest. The device in question comes from a relatively young manufacturer, GL.iNet, that has mostly built its reputation on compact routers over the past few years. And on paper, it’s quite the disruptor: it can fit in a pocket, has 2.5Gbit Ethernet, uses USB-C for power, and packs more useful software features than routers that cost hundreds of dollars.",

Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared. This happened to me, too: I got the pop-up around early December, tried to click it, but it was immediately gone, never to reappear again. …",

    "body": "Galaxy Z Fold 4 Credit: Ryan Whitwam / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung is rumored to revive S Pen support for the Galaxy Fold. Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",
