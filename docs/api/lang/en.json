    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset has a hidden USB-C port under a cap on the right strap. The USB-C port works independently of the proprietary battery connector, so Galaxy XR can charge and use wired accessories simultaneously. Compared to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest headsets, Galaxy XR figures to handle wired accessories better thanks to the dedicated port. Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

Google is officially putting health-focused AI to work on users’ wrists. Beginning October 28, the company will open a public preview of its Gemini-powered Fitbit Personal Health Coach for Fitbit Premium users in the US. The feature was first announced in August, when Google launched the Pixel Watch 4 . It uses Gemini’s conversational smarts to blend fitness training, sleep analysis, and general health advice into a single chat-based experience. Rather than simply a new feature, the rollout represents a test drive of Google’s broader vision of personalized wellness, coinciding with a complete Fitbit app overhaul. The app’s redesigned interface divides everything into four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health , and shifts the focus from daily streaks to long-term progress.

While we’ve generally been fans of the changes, not every swing in this Expressive direction is going to be a hit. And even though we saw Google take a very slow, measured approach to deploying these updates, some of those less-than-successful tweaks have managed to slip through to public releases.

With Halloween week upon us, it probably isn’t the best time for your smart home to start suggesting that people you aren’t familiar with have been wandering your property. However, a couple of Reddit users claim their Google Home devices have started describing people they don’t know. According to a post on the r/googlehome subreddit , a user’s Nest camera described an activity summary saying “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” even though no one by that name lives there. When the user asked about it, Google’s assistant reportedly replied that its camera “can identify faces even if you haven’t explicitly named them,” and that it had spotted “Michael” between October 26 and 27. The user said they’d never entered that name into the system, but the actions described were what he himself had done. He found the response …",

    "body": "TL;DR The OneXFly Apex is a new premium Windows gaming handheld from One Netbook. It features an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, an 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, and an 85Wh external battery. More details will be revealed in a livestream tomorrow morning, but it won’t be cheap. While traditional Windows gaming handhelds, such as the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally , appear to be struggling with their releases, a new category of ultra-powerful handhelds has been surprisingly popular. The first was the GPD Win 5, which took the battery outside of the handheld and paired it with an unprecedented level of power in the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Now, another handheld is following suit, and it truly ups the ante. The OneXFly Apex is an upcoming handheld with a massive 8-inch 120Hz VRR display, even larger than the 7-inch display on the GPD Win 5. This could be the same IPS display used on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Legion Go S. We loved the display in our review of the Legion Go S , although it’s not as premium as the 8.8-inch OLED panel in the upcoming Legion Go 2 .",

The phone also loses Hasselblad branding, while the camera hardware could be a sidegrade. OnePlus has been teasing the OnePlus 15 for weeks ahead of its launch event, revealing battery info, some camera details, and more. Thankfully, the wait for a full reveal is over, as OnePlus has just launched the device in China today. We’ve already seen the phone’s design, featuring flat edges with curved corners and a redesigned rear camera bump. OnePlus says the phone also has IP69 and IP69K ratings, which are overkill but still welcome after years of IP rating disappointment. Take a closer look at the left edge of the phone, and you’ll see a remappable shortcut button in lieu of the trademark alert slider. That’s a significant move after years of OnePlus flagships using the slider key (with the exception of the OnePlus 10T). Nevertheless, this shortcut key can be used for ringing profiles, AI functionality, taking screenshots, and more.",

The phone may be initially limited to Asian markets — particularly South Korea, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. Despite previous reports of a launch in the US, Samsung may choose not to launch it beyond the “Greater China” region. 2025 appears to be the year of new products from Samsung. After experimenting with the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Samsung released its first XR (extended reality) headset earlier this month. Very soon, it may unveil its most hyped device of the year in the form of the triple-folding smartphone. And, as per recent reports, we may not have to wait much longer to witness this new marvel. As per industry sources, Samsung’s tri-fold is set to make its official appearance as early as this week. The Korea Herald reports the (supposedly named) Galaxy Z TriFold will be unveiled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, scheduled to take place in the Gyeongju province in South Korea.",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR The ARMSX2 emulator for Android has just received its V1.0 release on GitHub, with a Play Store release coming later this week. The app differs from NetherSX2 due to its open-source nature and its use of a more recent foundation. NetherSX2 still offers better performance, though, while this ARMSX2 release had a major bug for some. PS2 emulation on Android has been in a strange place since the pioneering AetherSX2 app was abandoned. Some developers took over this shuttered project and made impressive changes to it (resulting in NetherSX2), but the somewhat closed nature and aging foundation suggest this isn’t a long-term solution. Fortunately, the ARMSX2 emulator has been in testing for a while, and it’s finally received a version 1.0 release. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through.

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

This is the £1,300 phone’s penultimate scheduled Android OS upgrade, despite launching last year. Sony surprised us last month when it brought the Android 16 update to the Xperia 1 VII . Now, the company has followed up by bringing the new Android upgrade to last year’s flagship phone. Sony Xperia 1 VI owners on the Xperia subreddit have reported the availability of the Android 16 update. This release appears to be limited to the likes of Bulgaria and Poland right now. So owners in other markets might have to wait a few days for a wider rollout.",

Users will be able to assign higher priority to notifications from certain apps. The feature will also use AI to arrange notifications based on priority. Samsung is prepping for a significant step-up for its smartphones’ interface with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update. Ahead of the purported beta rollout starting late next month, we’ve already encountered nearly a dozen noticeable changes that could come to eligible Samsung phones and tablets with the update, including iOS-like summarization for notifications using AI . And now, we’re learning about another potential notification upgrade. With One UI 8.5, Samsung may let you assign a higher priority to specific notifications, based on the feature added to a recently leaked One UI 8.5 build. As spotted by Sammyguru , the “Prioritize notification” option could be toggled on to set certain notifications as important.",
