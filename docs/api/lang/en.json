Google’s Wear OS has been the choice of interface for several generations of TAG Heuer Connected series smartwatches. However, the luxury watchmaker is changing that with the latest generation of the series, replacing Wear OS with a custom operating system that plays well with the iPhone. TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

The issue persists across multiple apps, including third-party ones that utilize Google’s EIS API. Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.

New code suggests that users will have multiple control options to customize when automatic call screening is in use, similar to Pixels. The update could also let AI answer your calls after a certain amount of time. Update: October 9, 2025 (5:05 AM ET): Galaxy Techie on Twitter posted a series of screenshots highlighting this new call screening feature, which is apparently called Auto answer with AI . Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

Google TV would run these checks if you haven’t used your remote in a while. The platform would then stop playing the channel if you don’t respond to the prompt. Some streaming services, like Netflix , offer a pop-up to check if you’re still watching a series. This is especially handy if you’ve fallen asleep. Now, we’ve discovered that Google TV itself could get a similar prompt. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Both Ring users and non-users are uneasy about the feature because of potential legal, security, and privacy risks. The feature won’t launch in states with strict facial recognition laws like Illinois and Texas. Amazon recently announced a new facial recognition feature for Ring doorbells and cameras called “Familiar Faces.” The feature isn’t even out yet, but it’s already raising eyebrows because of how popular Ring security cameras have become over the years.",

It’s still as elegant as when I first saw it, with its reduced front bezel and larger display, and more specifically with its eye-catching Jade color. I’ve always loved green, so seeing the color come to a premium phone, even under this pastel shade, is a bit of a dream come true. At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025. What you can’t see are the two major upgrades under the surface, and in my opinion, even though they don’t justify upgrading from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to the 10 Pro Fold, they do mark a new era for foldable hardware.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

These new alerts aim to solve the service’s poor discoverability, as many users are unaware that Health Connect exists on their phones. The prompts come as Google prepares to expand the platform with new features, such as native step tracking in an upcoming Android update. There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022. Although the number of compatible apps and its feature set have grown steadily since its debut, many people still don’t know it exists. That’s why Google is sending alerts prompting users to connect their apps to Health Connect. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR Some Android gamers are running the Xenia emulator inside GameHub or Winlator to play Xbox 360 games on their phones. Many tested games have very poor performance, although a few titles do seem to run at a playable frame rate. The good news is that an Xbox 360 emulator is in the works for Android. There’s no shortage of quality emulators on Android today, allowing you to run everything from NES and PlayStation 3 games to PC titles. But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",

In a recent interview, Google Home’s Chief Product Officer promised that the company would soon have news to share. That said, it’s unlikely Google will launch a new smart display this year. It’s been four years since Google launched a new Nest Hub. The most recent one — Nest Hub (2nd Gen) — came out in 2021, and since then, we haven’t seen a true-blue smart display from Google. This is also partially because in 2023, Google launched the Pixel Tablet, which doubles up as a smart home display when docked. However, even when Google introduced its tablet refresh, the company never explicitly said that it’s killing off the Nest hub line. Now, it looks like we may finally have some clarity on the future of Nest Hubs and how Google is thinking about them.",

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",
