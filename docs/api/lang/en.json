The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands. The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the “mane of a lion.” Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in Küsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs “Nutbush City Limits,” “Proud Mary,” “Private Dancer,” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero,” from the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.”…",

In the 12-second clip shared to Instagram , Wallen appears in a war-torn setting, sporting a backward baseball cap and a green long-sleeve shirt while wielding an intimidatingly large automatic rifle. &#8220;For the bad guys out there,&#8221; Wallen says as he cocks his weapon. &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m the problem.&#8221; The line is a direct nod to Wallen’s latest album, I’m the Problem , which spent 12 nonconsecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 following its release in May 2025. The teaser ends with a message revealing that the full live-action trailer for Battlefield 6 will drop Sunday (Sept. 28). Wallen isn&#8217;t the only celebrity joining the Battlefield 6 campaign.

It will conclude in Kópavogur, Iceland, on March 15, 2026. Laufey (it’s pronounced LAY-vay, for those still catching up to her) won a Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album in 2024 for her sophomore album, Bewitched , and she could be headed for another win in that category on Feb. 1 for her third album, A Matter of Time . The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 4. It has topped Billboard ’s Jazz Albums chart for the past four weeks. ( Bewitched logged 102 weeks at No. 1 on that chart.)
