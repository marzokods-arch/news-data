That's because today I stumbled across Pinball Map , an open-source, crowd-sourced map that documents publicly accessible pinball machines across the globe (via MetaFilter ). Beginning in 2008, the map now covers over 51,000 machines situated at more than 12,000 different locations. They're not all in pubs or bars, with some even being legitimate museum pieces. If you're on the go, there are even free Android and iOS app versions of the map . Taking a gander at what's close to home for me, it looks like I could easily hop on a train, pour a heap of coins into a machine the next city over, and then be back before my colleagues even got too suspicious.

    "body": "The thrill of every great roguelike deckbuilder is, at its core, a simple one: make the numbers as big as they can go. It's surprisingly bold, then, that upcoming game Talystro turns that entirely on its head. On this little mouse's quest, the goal is instead to make specific numbers. Enemies don't have health, they simply are a number—as low as one or, in my experience so far, as high as 55 (terrifying!). To kill them, you need to generate an attack that meets that number exactly—only an 11 will beat an 11, or a 23 for a 23. In other words precision, not power, is king. (Image credit: Filiokus) Each round you roll a set of dice and draw a hand of cards. Dice slot into spaces on the cards, which add or subtract from their result in different ways. All cards with dice currently slotted contribute to your total attack number—once it's where you want it, you can launch it and destroy an enemy. It's partly a game of maths—faced with a set of numbers and modifiers, you're looking for the most direct ways to reach specific results. But it's also about resource management. With only so many dice and slots each round, the trick is using what you have as efficiently as possible. (Image cre…",

However, you won't have access to Memories immediately. You've no doubt seen the prompt in the inventory screen to 'find the Forgotten Temple'—yeah, that's for the Memories.

If you're anything like me, your natural instinct will be to immediately start hoarding every new thing you find and inevitably fill up your stash. That's where the backpack upgrade comes in, letting you handily increase your inventory size. Chances are, you've inspected your inventory and seen the small prompt about the backpack upgrade next to your character, but have no clue how to get or use it. I'll go over all of that below, as it's not even clear how the backpack upgrade works once you've crafted it. How to craft the backpack upgrade in Hytale (Image credit: Hypixel) You can unlock the backpack by crafting the upgrade in the 'tinkering' section of the Workbench. This requires: Eight iron ingots 16 medium leather Iron is located in deep caves in all biomes, including the starting Emerald Wilds area, and you'll get medium hide from predators like wolves, which you can turn into leather at a Tanning Rack.

So that you're not running around for an hour, mercilessly killing random animals in the hopes they drop the type of leather you need, I'll go over where you need to look below.

To save you the hassle that I went through, below I'll cover how to get softwood planks. It's not as simple as just chopping down the right type of tree, either, as you need to process the logs, too.

As entertaining as Robb and Hansen's well-established rapport is, the full 40-minute interview is also eye-opening . For a start, while we already know AI is a big reason why we're experiencing a supply crisis , Robb eloquently communicates the sheer scale of the industry's hunger for memory.

They're just wafers.\" And what's even wilder is that a lot of that stock may not even be in active use, instead hoarded in storage as the industry struggles to find sufficient power to fit out functional data centers.

The latest security update, KB5074109 , will start a process of checking whether a PC is using the expiring Secure Boot certificates (2011 CA) and provide the newer certificates (2023 CA) if so. As Microsoft notes, many existing PCs have these newer certificates already.

Right now, Samsung somehow has both the most reasonable OLED gaming monitor in both the US and the UK, so it's a great time to get that upgrade. For $380, you can pick up Samsung's Odyssey G50SF at Amazon , which only launched a handful of months ago. That's a $170 saving on a monitor that's already a reasonable price at MSRP. Join us on WhatsApp for daily deals , direct to your phone. If you've had the joy of gaming on an OLED monitor, you will know why this asking price is worth it. If not, you are getting the truest of blacks and the most vibrant colors with this panel technology.

When the company increased prices for laptop memory late last year , it managed not to crank up Desktop and Mainboard prices. But no longer. In an updated blog post , Framework says that memory prices from its suppliers \"continue to increase rapidly\". Apparently, 128 Gbit chips have been hit hardest by the price spikes. And it's those chips that go into 128 GB configurations. And thus it's the 128 GB option that's been hit hardest. By way of example, until these price changes, Framework was charging $799 / £799 for a 32 GB Framework Desktop Mainboard with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 chip . Now it requires $839 / £839, so not too painful a premium. Step up to the 64 GB variant with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 and $1,299 / £1,299 has become $1,339 / £1,339. Again, that's not entirely catastrophic. So, the real pain is reserved for the 128 GB option with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395. That was $1,699 / £1,699. But it's now $2,159 / £2,159.

He decided to retire or take a break back in 2023, but has since popped up again solely to stream Arc Raiders. (Image credit: Embark Studios) The sin that Tfue committed? He was one of the many raiders who accessed the console command exploit. During a stream , Tfue's chat was pointing him towards this exploit that could remove any shadows from the map, which he then tried out in the training range and on Stella Montis. From what I've seen, that's all Tfue did—he just walked around Stella Montis, talking about how bright everything looks and then dipped.

A not-insignificant reason for this is the Steam community awards system.

But, you won't be able to tame these animals. Instead, we can only unlock dogs and cats as pets in Heartopia, and we've got to put in the work to get there first. Heartopia is all about hobbies, and caring for cats and dogs comes as two separate tasks. You need to make your way through a number of D.G. Member levels before you can get there, but it's well worth the effort once you lay eyes on these fuzzy friends. Here's how you can unlock pets in Heartopia. How to unlock pets in Heartopia You'll unlock the ability to care for pets when you reach Level 12 as a D.G. Member. As soon as you've hit this milestone, you'll be given a quest that tasks you with talking to Mrs. Joan in her adoption centre in the middle of town. When you speak to Mrs. Joan, she will talk you through the process of adopting an animal. Unfortunately for dog lovers, you will have to go with a cat first as part of the quest, but if you speak to Mrs. Joan straight after, she'll start talking to you about the dogs.

After breaking out of Vault 31, Norm and the rest of Bud's Buds travel the Wasteland and arrive at the old Vault-Tec HQ, where Norm manages to find a working terminal and hacks in to discover what the company had planned for Vault 31, 32, and 33.

Despite the lack of a battle, it is nice to see typically too-cool-for-school Ghoul absolutely terrified, and we know why: he was maybe the first person to ever see a deathclaw in the wild in Alaska, and even after 200 years they still make his irradiated blood run cold. It's not a great sign for New Vegas that deathclaws have moved into the Strip, though on the other side of the fence at least Freeside is looking busier and more bustling than it ever has. Those deathclaws are now between The Ghoul and Hank MacLean, who's holed up in the secret management Vault-Tec vault The Ghoul has never managed to find—the one he believes contains his missing wife and daughter.

Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is strictly prohibited in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement. The announcement comes after a surge in awful AI-generated music acts last year. The most infamous was probably The Velvet Sundown : at its peak the non-existent psych-rock four-piece was attracting 500,000 monthly listeners, but now generally only attracts around 160,000. Mind you, that is still a heck of a lot, especially for music so bland it sounds unmistakably like AI (though the same could have been said for Wolfmother in 2005, had generative AI existed back then).

So it's genuinely great news that Hytale, which was cancelled last summer by Riot, beat the odds and had what sounds like a massive launch today , with preorders securing enough funds to support several more years of development . No matter what, that's a remarkable achievement for a game that was all but dead and buried just a few months ago. And after spending some time today in Hytale today, I can already see the years of work that went into it. I can also see, as the devs warned us before launch, that it's got a long way to go. Back in November, Hypixel Studios CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme said the adventure sandbox ' isn't good yet ', but it already feels pretty good to me.

If you're in the same boat, don't worry—I'll set you on the easier path to survival with a quick rundown on how to get iron in Hytale , including what you'll need to mine deposits and process your ore haul. Where to find iron in Hytale Look along cave walls for small deposits of iron. (Image credit: Hypixel Studios) You can find iron in Hytale by exploring underground caves in any of the Emerald Grove biomes. I found plenty of iron deposits close to the entrance of a few deep tunnels near where I spawned in the grassy meadows. It also seems like the deeper you go into the caves, the more iron you'll find, but be prepared for tougher cave-dwelling monsters and pitch-black darkness. It's also pretty easy to get lost, so take extra care if you're still in the early game. I've died to just as many spiders as bears thanks to \"just one more node\" greed.

The classic desktop designed for mouse and keyboard was gone, based on a prediction that soon everyone would want to use all their devices in the same way (this has still not come to pass). At the same time Microsoft's UI designers performed an all-time beefing-it maneuver, its business geniuses rolled out a new Apple-inspired Microsoft Store and method of locking down apps that spurred Valve's Gabe Newell to declare \"Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space\" and start investing into Linux development. It was truly the nadir of Windows' 40 year history—and is now proof that there's an audience for literally everything, because someone has made a Windows 8 desktop environment for Linux.

Minor spoiler warning (maybe, I guess??) for Fallout season 2 (Image credit: Prime Video) Images of Funko Pop's new line of figures based on Fallout season 2 have started to pop up online, and they appear to spoil a pretty major part of the Legion plotline (spotted by Eurogamer ). We first get to see the Legion towards the end of episode 2 when Lucy leads an injured slave back to the barracks, where what remains of Caesar's troops are split in two, warring over the next rightful successor. This is also where we meet Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate for the first time. We then leave the Legion in a state of disarray in episode 3 . After the Ghoul rescues Lucy by bargaining her life for the whereabouts of NCR's last camp, the pair leave the barracks only for some explosives to go off (presumably set by the Ghoul), triggering an all-out war between the two…",

DLSS 4.5 can draw a ton more power from your graphics card. Nick has been going to town testing DLSS 4.5 since the Nvidia App beta released, running presets across different games and across both an RTX 5090 and an RTX 3060 Ti , just to see how hefty the performance difference is between the GPU generations. While editing his article I've been scrubbing through the video benchmarks on the page, and while you're not always seeing a huge performance difference in terms of frame rates, you're often seeing a big delta between the power draw of the two DLSS models. That there is a power differential at all isn't a surprise; when Nvidia introduced DLSS 4 at CES 2025 it explained the transformer model had allowed it to be more computationally expensive than the convolutional neural network model, and so it was using four times more comp…",

But the impact of the buyout was incommensurate with its cost. For years, GOG has marketed itself as the videogame storefront with values: preserving games, keeping them DRM-free, and letting you actually own them. But values have a tendency to fall by the wayside in the tumult of a corporate sale. Players were concerned. But perhaps there's comfort to be taken from the fact that GOG's new boss is, quite literally, the same as the old boss. The store was acquired by Michał Kiciński, its original co-founder, under the explicit banner of preserving its integrity and mission statement. (Image credit: GOG) \"I think it has a very solid foundation as a company,\" Kiciński tells PC Gamer. \"Good results, a very good brand—known, respected—with very clear values, and customers love it and stand behind it.\" Plus, Kiciński has a sentimental attachment: \"The less business[-y] reasons [for buying GOG] were: I'm kind of a parent of the company.

So rather than another day of doom and gloom talking about the rise of AI and the memorypocalypse , let's look at some positives. Probably the most important area we saw really exciting developments in was OLED monitors. One of the biggest problems with these that has probably stopped a lot of people from taking the plunge and buying one—alongside high price tags and worries about burn-in—is text fringing. OLED panels look fantastic for gaming, but for other things, they haven't always been the best choice, because small, thin, and wriggly little shapes such as letters (the most common little digital wrigglers) have tended to look a little fuzzy when displayed on an OLED panel. That's because of the way OLED displays its pixels. As a refresher, there are two main types of OLED panels: QD-OLED, from Samsung, and WOLED, from LG. These do things slightly differently at the sub-pixel level—QD-OLEDs have square red, green,…",

With version 4.5, Nvidia has introduced three new elements to its AI-powered suite of rendering technologies: a second generation transformer neural network for DLSS Super Resolution (aka upscaling), dynamic Multi Frame Generation (MFG), and a 6x mode. However, only the first one is available to use right now, as the new frame gen stuff won't make an appearance until spring. How to use DLSS 4.5 in games In order to force games to use the new upscaler, you'll need to use the 591.74 GeForce Game Ready drivers , plus the latest beta version of the Nvidia app (though a full release may be released by the time you're reading this). To get that, click on the Settings option in the Nvidia app, then select About, and finally check the option to opt into betas.
