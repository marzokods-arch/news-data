A team of researchers has shown that even major carriers like T-Mobile were broadcasting calls and text messages over satellites without encryption. All it took to intercept them was around $800 worth of off-the-shelf hardware. According to a study by researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Maryland, as reported by Wired , roughly half of all geostationary satellite signals they scanned were sent unencrypted. Over the course of three years, the team, led by UCSD professor Aaron Schulman, pointed a standard satellite dish at the sky from a building in La Jolla, California, and recorded data from 39 satellites.

Making sure your phone is running all its latest software updates is supposed to be how you keep it operating at peak performance, right? After all, fixes and patches are designed to take care of bugs and ensure system stability. That may be the idea, anyway, but every once in a while we hear about an update that inadvertently introduces a few new glitches of its own, and somehow ends up breaking just as much as it fixes.

Whether you like it or not, Google isn’t backing down on its attempts to increase engagement by automatically translating audio into your native tongue. Now, following continuous and unwavering stabs at simply translating audio with autodubbing, YouTube may take it a notch higher with realistic-looking audio dubs with accurate lip sync in an attempt to make videos more appealing with AI . YouTube’s product lead for Auto-dubbing, Buddhika Kottahachchi, recently detailed the technology behind lip-synced autodubs in a conversation with Digital Trends . Kottahachchi informed the publication that the system makes intricate pixel-level changes to modify the speaker’s mouth, ensuring the dub looks realistic.

When you consider that all of these phones were released in the United States, it makes you think that — finally — folding phones are not only becoming more mainstream in the country, but that the innovation for them hasn’t died either.",

Gamifying the investment process makes it look less daunting and more fun, which is a great way to attract new customers. Robinhood also came under public scrutiny years ago when it imposed trading restrictions during the meme stock frenzy, a move that many of its clients took to heart.",

The update is based on Google’s latest Wear OS 6 platform. Samsung is also testing a beta for the Galaxy Watch 6 and is expected to also release the update for the Watch 5 and Watch 4. Earlier this week, Galaxy Watch 7 joined the list of watches running Google’s latest Wear OS 6 interface. It arrived with the stable One UI 8 Watch update, which, until yesterday, was limited to beta testers in Korea. Shortly after, however, Samsung also made the update available to a select set of users in the US, signalling the beginning of a broader release in the region. Two simultaneous reports indicate that the One UI 8 Watch update for the Galaxy Watch 7 is now live in the US. The first comes from Reddit user akaGustavo , who received the update on their 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 with LTE. A few others replied to the same thread, confirming the release. Meanwhile, Verizon has also officially confirmed the release for both the 40mm and 44mm variants of the Galaxy Watch 7.",

Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

Some early users say the feature isn’t functioning accurately, reporting ghost sightings and misidentifying animals and objects. The feature is still in early access and costs $10/month as part of Google’s Home Premium plan. Google recently rolled out a major update to Google Home . Home Brief is one of the new Gemini-powered features that arrived with that update. It’s designed to give users a quick overview of their day by automatically identifying key household events and summarizing hours of footage into a short, easy-to-digest recap. The idea sounds promising, but it appears the feature isn’t working the way it should for everyone. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support.

While many rival devices let you change the entire look and feel of the UI with single-click custom themes , Pixel phones lack this convenience, requiring you to manually configure the home and lock screens to achieve your desired look.",

Before I talk about the new app that I’ve found, I should clarify what widget stacks are. On a Samsung phone, you can long-press a widget that’s already on your home screen and tap a Create stack button. This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there. Once you’ve selected the second widget, One UI stacks it on top of the one that was already on your home screen. Now, you can scroll horizontally through those widgets.",

    "body": "TL;DR Code in a leaked One UI 8.5 build shows Samsung is working on a utility to transfer eSIMs from iOS to Galaxy phones. Moving an eSIM from an iPhone to a Samsung one currently requires contacting your carrier. A One UI 8.5 beta is expected to kick off in November. Using eSIM to move your phone number between two Android phones or two iPhones has been a pretty simple procedure for some time now, but moving from iOS to Android or vice versa is a little more involved. Apple and Google have worked together to streamline the process in iOS 26 and Android 16, but getting your phone number to jump from an iPhone to a Samsung device using eSIM still requires contacting your carrier. It seems like that could change soon, though. We’ve found evidence that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update will include the option to port an eSIM phone number from an iPhone to a Samsung one without having to get your carrier involved. Given Samsung is the leading Android manufacturer, this change could end up benefitting a lot of Android converts.",

Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
