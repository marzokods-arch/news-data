As games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said this week , no one really knows, but the speculation we're hearing from analysts and corporate finance experts is that EA's new owners aren't likely to shake things up in the immediate future, and will probably do what you'd expect: focus on its existing live service moneymakers as it pays off that $20 billion in debt. Philip Alberstat, managing director at DBD Investment Bank, doesn't foresee a Toys 'R' Us-style descent into bankruptcy so long as that live service business stays strong. \"EA generates approximately $7.5 billion annually from franchises like Apex Legends, Battlefield, and FIFA [now EA Sports FC],\" said Alberstat. \"That flow of cash gives EA a real capacity to service the $20 billion in debt. The Toys 'R' Us comparison gets thrown around, but in reality that was a dying retailer. EA has sustainable revenue from live services across multiple platforms.\" Beyond i…",

I don't understand why Bandai Namco hasn't shamelessly ripped off the latter with a My Hero Academia game that'd make approximately one billion dollars, but its latest videogame adaptation is at least inching in that direction. At last week's Tokyo Game Show I played about half an hour of My Hero Academia: All's Justice, which is out on Steam next February. It's following a pair of games (One Justice and One Justice 2) that took one of the two default paths for an anime adaptation. They aren't gacha games, which means they're arena fighters like Jump Force : 3D beat-em-ups with relatively simple fighting mechanics compared to a Street Fighter or Tekken, where there's not a lot of meat on the bones beyond the simple pleasure of playing as your favorite characters.

There's no one culprit for this widespread problem, but the industry's obsession with graphics is looking guiltier every day. Devs are increasingly happy to sacrifice acceptable performance at the altar of Unreal Engine 5's bells and whistles, serving up games that look slightly better than a handful of years ago (if you squint, and provided you drop a grand on a new video card).

It's a fun rabbit hole to dive down, if you've got a few hours to kill. If, on the other hand, you're really just here for the games, we can do that too. The Waaaghtober!

Preloading ensures that players can jump into the game quickly on day one, which is especially beneficial for titles with large downloads.\" Preloading is a practical feature but not very glamorous as these things go; what makes it notable here is that it's been available for years on Steam. Yet Epic, despite being hell-bent on breaking Steam's nigh-monopoly on the PC digital market, hasn't seen fit to add it until now. And it's not as though Epic isn't aware that the absence of preloading, and other such mundane but useful features, is a problem.

Forden's first game credit, for sound, is on the 1989 Midway arcade basketball game Arch Rivals. He's most famous for being the voice (and face) of one of the most random but iconic soundbites in gaming history: yelling \"Toasty!\" when you uppercut someone in Mortal Kombat. \"Wednesday was my last day at Netherrealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff,\" Forden wrote in a farewell post on Instagram . Forden was part of the tiny team that created the original Mortal Kombat in 1992, alongside designers Ed Boon and John Tobias and artist John Vogel. When they set to work on Mortal Kombat 2, Foden was again responsible for the game's sound and music, and credits Boon with suggesting they add an image of him appearing in the corner and saying \"Toasty!\" as an inside joke; the catchphrase started as a taunt when the two of them were working on Midway …",

Released on September 22, the patch \"fixed faulty spam filters on Simon’s PC,\" according to the patch notes , which warned that \"users may still receive suspicious correspondence due to treemail 0.1 filtering process issues.\" Players immediately began checking Simon's email and quickly discovered a link to hotelsamsara.com , \"a new investment opportunity promising an out of this world experience.\" \"Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond,\" the site says. \"Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious.

When the EA buyout was still a rumor, Vincke quipped that \"Someone really wanted to get the rights to Murder on the Zinderneuf,\" referring to one of EA's first games from back in 1983, an 8-bit detective mystery for personal computers of the time like the Apple II and Commodore 64. Probably a good time to remind people that making games faster and cheaper while charging more has never worked before. October 2, 2025 Vincke had a more serious message today , following confirmation of the deal, as well as serial studio-closer Microsoft's announcement of a Game Pass price hike: \"Probably a good time to remind people that making games faster and cheaper while charging more has never worked before.\" Vincke doesn't name names, but this can pretty clearly only be commentary on the biggest stories in gaming right now.

At the time EA was at least gracious towards its former partner, but FIFA wasn't in any mood to play nice. \"I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans,\" thundered FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the time. \"The FIFA name is the only global, original title.

I always thought the most logical next step for FIFA would be partnering with Konami's eFootball, which remains the most likely competitor to EA Sports FC (even if it's currently in the doldrums).

While the two share a common genre, the real reason behind this team-up is much simpler, as Bucky said they're \"just big fans\" of the game.

That's a $200 billion jump up from its last valuation back in late March this year . The latest valuation (via Reuters ) follows on the heels of a deal in which current and former employees at the company sold about $6.6 billion worth of shares. According to an anonymous source that spoke to Reuters, these shares were sold to a number of interested investors at SoftBank, Abu Dhabi's MGX, Thrive Capital, T. Rowe Price and Dragoneer Investment Group. SoftBank has previously invested about $22 billion into the company and last month, Nvidia also joined the AI investment feeding frenzy by signing a deal to ultimately send $100 billion OpenAI's way . This latest $500 billion valuation makes OpenAI the world's largest startup, according to Bloomberg , seeing the company outpace even Elon Musk's SpaceX and its own $400 billion valuation .

Rhythm Doctor is unlike any rhythm game I’ve played before—while I’m used to four, five, or even eight-button spreads, Rhythm Doctor only requires one finger and the humble spacebar. Notes skirt along an EKG to different rhythms, sometimes throwing multiple notes for me to keep track of each beat. The real joy of Rhythm Doctor, though, comes from its visuals. Each level has some wonderfully unique storytelling through its art and the things that are happening between (and often during) my button presses. From levels that play out like those dodgy mobile ads that flood the screen with notifications and glitches, to one level that’s so special I don’t want to spoil it here. Seriously, it’s one you have to play for yourself.

If you've been spending a lot of time with Cogsworth and completing duties or doing the task you allocated to him at level two, you'll hit this milestone in no time. If you're struggling to unlock this quest, make sure that you've made good progress with Elsa and Anna, and you have a relatively high friendship level with them both. You'll also need complete access to the Frosted Heights, but if you've come as far as unlocking Cogsworth then you've probably already got this covered. Once the quest is available and you've hit that friendship milestone, this is what you need to do. How to complete On Her Majesty's Festive Service in Disney Dreamlight Valley Speak to Cogsworth once you've unlocked this quest and he will express that since the Beast doesn't need serving, he's at a loss of what to do with himself. You suggest tending to the needs of the villagers, but he's hesitant to serve royalty. This means you have to take him to Anna, since she's the Queen of Arendelle. Unsurprisingly, when you speak to Anna she won't have any duties…",

Before that? 2022—a few months before I even began working here—when we informed you that Amazon Prime subscribers could now access Devil May Cry 5 in their browsers . It never set the world on fire, is my point, but fear not, because Amazon knows exactly how to revive it: an \"AI-powered\" social game starring Snoop Dogg. Obviously. What else could it possibly have been? To be fair, AI judge Snoop isn't the sum total of Amazon's plans for Luna. It's the flagship title for its pivot into a couch co-op-focused service. The \"all-new Amazon Luna\" will still have big-budget games on it, but the emphasis will very much be on more casual stuff you can play with friends and family.

The upside is it's fantastic; the downside is it's got me playing Counter-Strike again. Those games ain't quick (especially since they removed the short game mode), and my aim ain't what it once was. But that's improving quickly, in part thanks to the Sabre V2 Pro. I first got my hands on it at Gamescom, though I had to keep schtum about that at the time.

I'm used to my Logitech G Pro X Superlight for competitive gaming, and I do still love that mouse , but it weighs 63 g, almost double this Corsair one. Part of what impressed me about the Superlight when I first fell in love with it was how it managed to achieve such a light weight while keeping its shell intact—sturdy, and free from holes.

You're not alone: 32% of Steam gamers surveyed in September 2025 have yet to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

The B580 is a value-oriented GPU, so you'd expect it to be a good option as a drop-in upgrade for older machines, yet it infamously runs poorly on ageing CPUs. Luckily, Hardware Unboxed recently pointed out that performance has gotten significantly better as of late. Back in April, when paired with a Ryzen 5 5600 playing Spider-Man Remastered on High settings, the B580 received an average fps around the mid-80s. Now, months later, with the same CPU but on the Very High setting, it manages to achieve an average fps of 118. So not only is it getting better scores, but it is also achieving that on a higher-quality graphic preset than previous B580 testing. It's worth noting the Ryzen 5 5600 isn't even a particularly old chip, originally launching in the middle of 2022. Where the B580 was once outshone by the 8GB AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT in the same test, they now stand neck and neck. However, it's n…",

In case you're not Saja Boys-pilled, here's a quick rundown on K-Pop Demon Hunters: Rumi, Zoey, and Mira are part of girl group Huntr/x—and also happen to be demon hunters, hence the name—with the movie following their story against demon boy band, the Saja Boys and protecting folk through strengthening the anti-demon barrier known as the Honmoon. It all sounds rather daft when I try and put it down on paper, but K-Pop Demon Hunters is wonderfully witty, both cribbing from and poking fun at K-Pop and K-dramas. It's a refreshing original story wrapped up in the excellent animation work seen in some of Sony's other recent ventures like the Spiderverse films. And, as someone who grew up deeply entrenched in second-generation K-Pop back in the late 2000s, the Saja Boys give me all the same fuzzy feelings that BigBang did back then. K-Pop Demon Hunters went straight to Netflix back in June and, well, has become a bit of a smash …",

Windows 11 is run by 63.04% of those surveyed, up from 60.39% last month. Windows 10, on the other hand, has dropped by 2.9%. You'll notice that's not the same number of users that have jumped to Windows 11, which maybe would suggest some have switched to other OS platforms, primarily Linux, for their gaming machines. However, Linux only saw a small 0.04% increase in the past month, so that's not exactly popping off. It's more likely we're just seeing the imperfect methods of the Steam Hardware Survey. The survey is far from a perfect representation of the userbase of Valve's platform—it's more akin to \"guidelines\" than actual data, to loosely quote Captain Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean.

With Monster Hunter Stories 3, Capcom finally seems to be giving its RPG spin-off the scope and budget it deserves to really pop off. This light turn-based RPG series, which casts you as a young monstie rider instead of a monster hunter, didn't come to PC until last year, even though it debuted on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. There was potential even then, but the YA story and rock-paper-scissors battle system seemed guided by the mistaken impression that the audience for Pokémon-likes is still first and foremost kids, and not the thirty/fortysomethings who grew up with them.

Sure, Steam reviews aren't always the most helpful, but who says they need to be? Scrolling Steam reviews is a great way to see what people are happy about, furious about, or sometimes just have a little chuckle. Steam reviewers can get pretty creative, too. A review on PC Gamer can contain a thousand words (often, quite a lot more), but sometimes a Steam reviewer can sum up a game in just a sentence or two, almost like poetry. (Keywords: sometimes and almost. ) In the quiz below, I'm willing to bet you can guess what game the Steam review blurb is from . No images, no paragraphs, just a few quick words that should clue you in to what game they're reviewing and how the reviewer feels about it. And when you're done, let us know how you did in the comments below! What game is this Steam review blurb from?",

It's a surprise for everyone who had assumed the rollout would happen more slowly to let players adjust to life without third-party tools telling them when a boss is going to do a dangerous attack. Professional raiders and casual players alike have relied on combat addons to assist them with the MMO's endgame dungeons for decades. But starting in Midnight, they'll have to rely on the default UI and their knowledge of the fights. Wowhead attended a group interview with game director Ion Hazzikostas and UX designer Crash Reed where they were asked about addon support going forward. Hazzikostas didn't explicitly say when addons will go away, but his answers imply it will happen in the final patch before Midnight launches. Hazzikostas said a blog post for addon authors is coming \"in the next day or two\" that will explain how some combat information will be stored in a black box of sorts, preventing addons from accessing it. \"The UI and addons can know that box exists, they can display info…",

If the deal earns shareholder and regulator approval, it'll be the largest leveraged buyout in history—and it's already inspiring dread in fans and EA developers alike. (Image credit: Electronic Arts) To understand why the buyout news seems dire to so many, we first need to understand private equity and what exactly a leveraged buyout entails. The PIF, meanwhile, is its own troubling wildcard. Since 1990, EA has been a public company: Like other publicly traded businesses, its ownership—or equity—has been determined by the distribution of shares of capital stock that are bought and sold through stock exchanges. Being a publicly traded company offers advantages, the most obvious being the ability to raise funds by selling shares of stock. But public companies have their disadvantages, too—particularly for consumers in creative and entertainment industries. Shareholder primacy, the theory that deliveri…",

He's known for being a quiet, very stoic sort of guy, but also someone who gets things done. \"Endure. In enduring, grow strong\" was his maxim, and also the character in a nutshell: He endured The Nameless One's bullshit, and by the end of Planescape: Torment would grow to become a very powerful character himself—although not powerful enough to keep his treasured Zerth blade from ending up in Baldur's Gate 2 a few years later. Dak'kon was voiced by television character actor stalwart Mitch Pileggi, who has no direct connection to Henry as far as I can tell.
