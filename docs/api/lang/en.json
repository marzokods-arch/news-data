    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro Max is rumored to feature a bigger battery than the current generation. The international variant of the iPhone 18 Pro could feature a battery capacity ranging between 5,100 and 5,200mAh. This will be higher than the battery capacity expected of the Galaxy S26 Ultra. With the launch of the iPhone 17 Pro last year, Apple flipped the narrative around minimal upgrades to its flagship phones. Even though the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were only slightly refashioned, the changes were enough to make it the highest-selling phone series of the past quarter. One area where it clearly shone was its impressive battery life. Meanwhile, Samsung has also faced the same criticism but remains in limbo with the same cameras and battery packs, especially on the Ultra, for nearly four generations. With the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the inertia could be more damaging, especially as Apple could surpass the Ultra. Famed leaker Digital Chat Station recently suggested that the next-generation top-tier iPhone could have its battery capacity bumped up over the current generation. According to the leaker, the iPhone 18 Pro Max’s battery could exceed …",

This is especially true for Samsung , which has been doing less each generation to set its devices apart. It is rumored that the situation will get even worse, as the Galaxy S26 is expected to be virtually identical to its predecessor, beyond a minor processor upgrade and a few other small refinements. I get the urge to feel like manufacturers are phoning it in (pun semi-intended), and that a change is needed. Still, I’m starting to realize it might be hardcore fans, and people like me, who need to change their perspective.",

The upcoming redesign will also add the ability to reorder passes and sort them alphabetically or by recently opened. Last week, we showed off Google Wallet’s upcoming home screen redesign , which centers on starring passes. It appears to be a nice change that focuses on the passes you think you’ll need the most. There was also a “View more” button, which we presumed would house the rest of your passes. The button didn’t work then, but with the latest Google Wallet v26.5.862583415 release, we now have a better idea of what this “View more” button on the upcoming home screen redesign would do.

With just a few weeks to the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series, we’re now approaching the point of marketing material leaking out. After a seemingly official poster emerged earlier in the week, followed by a short-lived listing with multiple colors on a low-profile e-commerce website, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is cropping up again, this time in a bold 360º video. The latest Galaxy S26 Ultra leak comes from leaker Evan Blass on X and flaunts the phone’s different side profiles in Cobalt Violet color. This is also perhaps the clearest, highest-quality leak for the Galaxy S26 series, so much so that it looks like Blass snagged it directly from the top marketing teams at Samsung headquarters.",

Metals are the materials most commonly used in welding, but it&#8217;s also possible to weld thermoplastics or wood. Welders use their hands, skills, and problem-solving abilities to create something new. At NASA, welders use different types of welding processes to assemble spacecraft and rocket components. Welders also put their expertise to work on equipment and facilities that make space exploration possible, such as launch pads, fuel tanks, propellant lines, and buildings where rockets are assembled. What are the different types of welding? Welding can be done in many different ways. Here are some of the types of welding used at NASA: Arc Welding: Uses electricity to melt metals and fuse them together. There are many types of arc welding, including TIG and MIG welding, described below. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding: Uses a protective gas like argon or helium to keep the metal from reacting with air. TIG welding doesn’t leave behind splatter or residue, giving a clean, precise weld. Metal Inert Gas (MIG) Welding: Whi…",

If you wanted smooth handheld footage without hauling around a full camera rig, its Pocket cameras and smartphone gimbals have often been the go-to option. That corner of the market may soon get a little more crowded. According to Jiemian News (via innoGyan ), vivo has confirmed it is working on a dedicated vlog camera aimed at taking on DJI’s Pocket lineup. The company says the project was initiated internally toward the end of 2025, with a commercial release planned for 2026. The product name hasn’t been finalized yet.",

Foley (UC Santa Cruz), Dark Energy Survey/DOE/FNAL/DECam/CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA; Acknowledgment: Mehmet Yüksek This new Hubble image, released on Jan. 30, 2026, is the sharpest taken of NGC 7722, a lenticular galaxy located about 187 million light-years away in the constellation&nbsp;Pegasus. A lenticular, meaning “lens-shaped,” galaxy is a type whose classification sits between more familiar&nbsp;spiral galaxies&nbsp;and&nbsp;elliptical galaxies. It is also less common than spirals and ellipticals — partly because these galaxies have a somewhat ambiguous appearance, making it hard to determine if it is a spiral, an elliptical, or something in between.

An Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan lowers monthly pricing while also reducing trade-in credits. The Loyalty plan is cheaper for large accounts, but cuts data, perks, and long-term price guarantees. T-Mobile isn’t making a big song and dance about it, but it has started offering two new plans designed to keep existing customers from drifting away . The catch is that neither plan is universally available, and because they aren’t advertised, you may not even know they exist unless you ask. Even then, it isn’t clear if they’ll be revealed. As The Mobile Report reports, citing internal T-Mobile sources, the new plans began rolling out today and are limited to certain “segmented” accounts selected by T-Mobile using undisclosed criteria. In short, it sounds like availability depends on who you are, how long you’ve been with T-Mobile, and maybe even which department you end up talking to. The image below shows how these two new plans compare to the standard ones.",

This year’s headline act is Bad Bunny, making him the first solo Latin artist to lead the prestigious halftime show. If you’ve somehow avoided his music until now, Sunday night might just change that. The Puerto Rican singer is heading into the halftime show on a serious high. He recently picked up Album of the Year at the Grammys for Debí Tirar Más Fotos, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to win the award, and his music has been everywhere in the run-up to the game. With tens of millions of viewers expected to tune in to Super Bowl LX, a lot of people are about to hear his songs for the first time.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

Our most likely interpretation, however, suggests this probably isn’t anything worth getting excited about. Tips about upcoming smartphones can turn up anywhere, and as we try to sort through all the rumors and theories surrounding upcoming devices, that can often mean looking at tips that don’t originate in a language we natively speak.

In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI.

The device is expected to launch in China around March, but we’re yet to see if and when it will come to other global markets. With the proliferation of specialist handhelds and more powerful gaming phones, compact Android gaming tablets don’t come around very often these days. However, Lenovo is determined not to give up on the idea. The company has now officially teased its next-generation Lenovo Legion Y700, offering a closer look at the device’s design ahead of its expected debut this year. The teasers were shared on Weibo (via NotebookCheck ), where Lenovo posted promotional images showing the tablet in both black and white finishes. In the accompanying text, Lenovo refers to the device as the “Lenovo AI Tablet Legion Y700,” with the AI part feeling almost obligatory in 2026.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority TL;DR Google’s latest app version includes code suggesting users may be able to attach map regions to prompts in Gemini. This functionality would enhance location-based queries by allowing users to visually select areas rather than typing place names. “Explore this area,” and similar commands hint at an integration that enables users to discover nearby places with one-tap interactions. One of the biggest advantages of Gemini is its conversational ability . Users can ask questions in natural language and imperfect commands, and Gemini will do its best to return a result. Google built on this advantage by allowing users to attach all sorts of files and media to Gemini to get even better, more personalized answers. Soon, Gemini could allow users to attach a map region to their prompt, opening the door for Gemini to become your personal travel guide.

    "body": "TL;DR Code from the latest Google app beta sheds light on Gemini’s upcoming agentic features on Android. Gemini could help you place orders online or hail rides without you needing to actively touch the phone. While these may be the initial applications, we could see more, as previewed by Google in its Project Astra demo last year. Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks. While Project Astra is still under development, we’re seeing evidence detailing some of its aspects. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

How many smartphone brands will be left by the end of 2026? We are living in what feels like a dangerous time to be a smartphone company, with manufacturers either closing up shop , backing away from flagships , or denying reports of business trouble . It’s almost enough to make you think there won’t be anyone left but Samsung and Apple before you know it. And as we wait to see what fate has in store for these companies, we’re getting some small reassurance that at least one minor player intends to keep going with new phones.
