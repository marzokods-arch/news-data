Amid efforts to cap profits on ticket resales, StubHub shares are down 47.1% from the company&#8217;s Sept. 16 IPO price, and Vivid Seats shares have fallen 91.8% this year. Ticketmaster operates a secondary market, but the company encourages artists to raise the price of primary tickets to capture revenue that would otherwise go to scalpers. This week, the 19-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) added to its woes by falling 2.1% to 2,542.64, marking its ninth decline in the last 11 weeks.
