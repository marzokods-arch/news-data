The Lite plan’s best rate requires an active Verizon voice line; otherwise, it costs $10 more per month. Speeds are capped at 25Mbps and aimed at rural users who previously relied on DSL or satellite connections. It seems every cellular carrier is pushing home internet hard these days. Even Mint Mobile recently announced plans for its own low-cost home internet service starting at just $30 a month when prepaid annually. Not one to be one-up in pricing in seems, Verizon has now announced a more competitive Lite plan that starts at just $25 a month. Unlike Mint, you don’t have to pay annually for this rate either.

An Infoblox report states that it behaves like malware, with keylogging features and disabled security tools. The browser has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, with ties to illegal gambling sites. A web browser claiming to keep your data safe may be doing exactly the opposite. According to a new investigation, an app called Universe Browser, which has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, surreptitiously installs dangerous software and routes your internet traffic through servers in China. The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The researchers say the ‘privacy browser’ behaves a lot like malware, with features that resemble keylogging, secret connections to external servers, and background activity that alters device settings. It even blocks features like right-click menus and developer tools, and disables key browser security protections.",

Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",

    "body": "If you’re a Samsung fan and have $1,800 burning a hole in your pocket, the South Korean tech giant just announced a brand new way for you to spend that money. On Tuesday, Samsung announced the Galaxy XR as its long-awaited XR headset to rival the Apple Vision Pro. As a VR/XR headset in the current market, the Galaxy XR does look promising. It’s got impressive hardware, capable specs, and powerful software with Android XR. But at the end of the day, the Galaxy XR is still very expensive. The headset itself costs $1,800, and if you buy the controllers and carrying case, you’re looking at an additional $500 .",

There’s no word on the length of the postponement, but we’re guessing this means a February or March release. This also comes after a recent leak that Samsung won’t offer a Galaxy S26 Pro. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series launched in January, much like the Galaxy S24 series last year. It stands to reason that the Galaxy S26 phones will launch in January 2026. However, a reliable tipster has now claimed that a delay is on the cards. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The feature, currently referred to as “Me Meme,” allows users to insert their face into meme templates. It requires a backed-up reference photo, preferably a clear selfie, to work. Google Photos is inarguably one of the best apps that you could have on your Android flagship. What makes Google Photos better is that Google has been constantly and tirelessly working on adding new features to the app, making it useful in the present times. We’ve spotted Nano Banana integration in the works, as well as improvements to the photo-to-video generator . We’ve now spotted Google Photos working on a meme generator, but with a twist: it will use AI to make you the meme.

The new phone will have a 1.5K resolution screen running at 165Hz, compared to the OnePlus 13’s QHD+ 120Hz display. The company says this is because it’s not possible to have a QHD+ screen running at 165Hz. The OnePlus 15 is scheduled to launch in China on Monday, and we know the phone has a 165Hz refresh rate. We previously heard rumors that the device would have a lower-resolution screen, though, and OnePlus has now confirmed this. OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

It hasn’t been released yet, but the creator may share it based on the community reaction. We thankfully don’t live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland just yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t wear a Pip-Boy on your wrist. A Reddit user has designed a Fallout-inspired Pixel Watch 4 watch face that’s not just for show, but actually pulls real data straight from the watch and Google Weather . The creation comes from u/Neo4114, who shared their homemade Pip-Boy face on the r/PixelWatch subreddit . They said it was their first watch face and that it took “many hours” to perfect, and we certainly think the result looks impressive enough to pass as an official release. The thread is full of praise for the design, preferring it to the existing Pip-Boy faces that one commenter repeatedly alluded to.",

    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

    "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH_7CeVVxDY Last week, I got to spend some time with Samsung’s newest device, a mixed reality headset called the Galaxy XR. This is the “Project Moohan” product Samsung has been working on for ages to take on the Apple Vision Pro. It’s an important launch for the company, and it’s even priced to compete — well, sort of. At $1,799 , it’s about half the price of Apple’s headset, which is certainly good news, but still a massive amount of money. I’ve already talked extensively about what the Galaxy XR is and what it’s like to use it. In this article, though, I want to talk about something I realized almost immediately after my demo with the headset: this isn’t really a Samsung device.",

If you’re on the fence about throwing down the best part of $2,000 or more, this hefty dent in your bank balance can at least come with a multi-part silver lining, as early adopters of the device can score an “Explorer Pack” worth as much as $1,000.

I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way.",

At the cost of some battery life, your phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature lets you see the time and new notifications at a glance. While most Android phones have an AOD, it doesn’t behave the same way on every device. Some phones let you schedule the AOD to benefit from its glanceable information without unnecessarily draining the battery. Pixel phones , however, offer no such controls — the AOD is either on or off during the day. Fortunately, Google is working on a new setting that will soon give Pixel users more control over this feature.

Samsung hasn’t shared when we should expect the update to resume. Samsung’s in the process of rolling out the Android 16-based One UI 8 across its wide range of compatible phones. The update started hitting the Galaxy S23 just a couple of weeks ago — but now, Samsung has halted that distribution. As reported by SammyGuru , Galaxy S23 phones aren’t currently able to download One UI 8. The S23 series is just the latest to have its One UI 8 rollout stopped: The S24 and S22 series both had the plug pulled on their respective rollouts, too (though SammyGuru says the S22’s update is “partially resumed”).",

This is the equivalent of Google’s incognito mode on its iOS app. There are many ways to perform an incognito search on your Android phone, but Google is working on adding another one that is both more intuitive and easier to remember. The option might have the less obvious name of “History Off Search” instead of a simpler “Incognito” and will appear straight in the main Google app. This will finally allow the Google app on Android to catch up to the iOS app, which has had an incognito mode for many years.

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
