Beating them all for sheer out-of-this-world coolness, though, is Doom on a satellite, orbiting the Earth. Well, it was . The European Space Agency (ESA) deorbited its OPS-SAT device back in May 2024, but before it was turned into dust motes, Georges Labrèche (engineering manager at ESA) contacted Ólafur Waage, a Norwegian software engineer , to see if he fancied a little challenge. Waage is no random coder, though, as he's a highly experienced game developer , working for Massive Entertainment—makers of Far Cry 6, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, and countless others. The challenge was simple on paper: port Doom to run on OPS-SAT. This satellite was an experiment by the ESA, which could be used by members of the public directly over the Internet. Essentially, if your access was approved, you could upload code to the little satellite (just 10 x 10 x 30 cm in size) and have it do stuff for science. Of course, there's…",

Well, EA is trying to allay some of those fears (via Polygon ). In a new FAQ for employees from October 30, the company promised that it was still \"in a strong financial position\" despite the small matter of $20 billion in debt and that it will \"maintain creative control\" over its projects even in its new era of private ownership. It also promises to maintain \"a thoughtful, steady approach to AI,\" after stories circulated about the new owners planning to make heavy use of the tech . What does that mean in practice?

I'm fighting a never-ending war with my inner hoarder—something I think we all have in extraction games. Well, that was until I realised that your inventory has a few tricks up its sleeve to cut down on clutter. Something that really helped me was the merge stacks button, which, I'll admit, took me way too long to realise even existed. When you're back in Speranza, just open up your inventory and you'll see the option to the right of the category filter.

By nature of it being an extraction shooter, however, it's not a matter of simply equipping the best gun in your loadout and venturing out topside. No, you'll have to find, craft, or buy higher-quality weapons. That takes time, and you can always lose them in a matter of seconds. With that in mind, below, I'll recommend the best weapons for each 'stage' of Arc Raiders, beginning with the strongest cheap weapons, and moving all the way up to the rarest, which aren't necessarily the best in all situations. Generally, if you lose a shootout against other players, it's probably more so down to your strategy and positioning than your gear, as most high-end guns are designed to improve versatility or handling over pure DPS.

That's the studio that made the brilliantly charming Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun , so it's a promising team-up. The footage looks cool, perfectly translating Warhammer into the iconic Vampire Survivors pixel art style and throwing in gags and easter eggs for the hobbyists out there, such as including a pot of Nuln Oil paint as a weapon.

The fix for this annoying reboot glitch already featured in October's optional update, KB5067036. If you happened to skip that—and who could blame you —the fix will also ship as part of Microsoft's regular Patch Tuesday update. This rolls out on the second Tuesday of every month, with the next one falling on November 11.

If there's one thing that can end your Minecraft session early, it's a Creeper. Fortunately, a mod has come to fruition that forces Creepers to ask you permission before they blow up, which is great for anyone lacking as much spatial awareness as me and doesn't often see them coming. As posted to YouTube by SectorFive , the Creeper Consent mod is exactly what it says on the tin. If you have a close encounter with the mob, just as they are about to explode, a screen will pop up, essentially asking you whether or not they can explode. Obviously, the immediate and only appropriate answer is no, which will make the Creeper disappear entirely when selected. Of course, if you let the Creeper do its business, you'll have to deal with the repercussions as normal, too. As satisfied as I would be with the consequences…",

Ayaneo, arguably one of the best handheld gaming PC makers, is finally taking a step into the mobile market, and early signs suggest it could be pretty unique. The Ayaneo Phone just got its first-ever teaser on the Ayaneo YouTube channel , opening with the phrase \"When mobile phone meets handheld soul\". The marketing language isn't done here, though, as Ayaneo calls it \"a mobile phone truly made for gamers\" and suggests it will be coming soon. This teaser only shows the back of the phone, which includes two camera lenses and a flashlight, but it certainly looks sleek under the intentionally low lighting.

That's probably longer than any human has ever lived, and they show no sign of letting up, despite the many letters I've written to the government. And wouldn't you know it—the Golden Joystick Awards return for their 43rd annual show this November 20, hosted by none other than actor Maggie Robertson (who you almost certainly know as the alarmingly tall Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil 8 , or possibly as Baldur's Gate 3's Orin the Red). Joining her are Alix Wilton Regan (Alt Cunningham from Cyberpunk 2077 ), Doug Cockle (Geralt in The Witcher games ), Ciara Berkely (the new voice of Ciri in The Witcher 4 ), Ben Starr (Verso in Clair Obscur , that one meme where he is impassive and bright), and Shai Matheson (the upcoming Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight). Which game will end up taking home the Ultimate Game of the Year award? Well, that depends on the whims of democracy— voting is live now , if you want to make your voice heard—but it'll be one of 12 games on the official shortlist. Those games are: Blue Prince Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Donkey Kong Bananza Ghost of Yōtei…",

But what is the most satisfying weapon in gaming history? That's an interesting question, and one that when asked by Apogee Entertainment's X account, was answered by none other than the grandfather of FPS games, John Romero, he of Doom fame. Super Shotgun. https://t.co/TikpaEHwhr November 3, 2025 Romero's response was the objectively correct one in my opinion, too, with Romero voting for the 'Super Shotgun', as introduced to gaming originally in Doom 2. Many other gamers agreed with the FPS legend, with comments replying with sentiments such as, 'Agreed! Double barrel in Doom 2', as well as 'it's a scientific fact' and 'it's the Super Shotgun for me too'. One reply simply states, 'I strongly agree, Mr Romero'. How polite. Naturally, there are plenty of other suggestions for most satisfying weapon in gaming, too, ranging from Doom's Plasma …",

    "body": "World of Warcraft is finally adding player housing in the next expansion, a feature I've seen people begging for since I started playing back in 2006. According to the players trying it out on the Midnight alpha, it's designed with almost no caveats to what you can create. There are years and years of decorations from various parts of the game that Blizzard is making available to stick in your house, which is why it's always seemed like a no-brainer for Blizzard to add. But there will also be new decorations, some of which are going to cost you real money, and now we have evidence of how that's going to work. Wowhead recently dug up a new premium currency in the Midnight alpha build called Hearthsteel. Datamined images depict Hearthsteel as silver coins with the swirly housing logo, which is based on Hearthstone's item art. Judging from the images that show different amounts of the coins, it seems pretty obvious that they're going to be a premium currency related to housing. While I doubt anyone will be surprised to see Blizzard preparing to charge for housing stuff this quickly, it's actually a first for WoW to have a distinct premium currency. Right now, cosmetics on WoW's shop …",

Maybe so, but that's about to change, as 400 players will be flown to Miami to sit at poker tables playing Solitaire on iPads (at least according to the video on that page). Can you feel the excitement? Not really? Let me up the ante, then: they'll be competing (at Solitaire on iPads, remember) for a chance to win $150,000, and it's all being presided over by notorious ESPN loudmouth Stephen A. Smith. If you're still not excited, you must at least be curious about how you could possibly make Solitaire interesting to watch, even with the boisterous Smith tapped to host.

Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire added a turn-based mode as an update after launch, but my worries about retrofitting a real time with pause game in this way were compounded by the fact that you were locked into one or the other at the beginning of a playthrough. In addition, turn-based's design changes effectively nerfed some builds and buffed others, meaning you'd have to relearn an already complicated RPG. Obsidian touts \"significantly increased\" combat lethality to help avoid the unintentionally overlong fights you could run into in turn-based Deadfire⁠—Sawyer cited Deadfire mods that accomplish the same thing⁠—while the \"Unbound Turns\" and \"Smarter Free Actions\" line items look like they could avoid the sharp balance differences we saw in Deadfire.

Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points.

Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS.

Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element.

No, I personally don't care much for any of that AI nonsense. In Preview Build 26220.7051 , the real headliner for me is Shared Audio, a new feature that allows for two folks to watch the same movie or listen to the same playlist via two separate Bluetooth devices. It's the little things. For Windows Insiders, it works much like connecting your Copilot+ PC to any singular Bluetooth audio device. Just navigate over to the 'shared audio (preview)' tile in the quick settings menu, select two compatible, already paired audio devices, and then hit 'share'. Now, there truly is no escape from my Miku Hatsune playlist. Well, that is unless my put-upon pals can avoid placing themselves within about 30 paces of a compatible device. There's a more in-depth Windows blog post about extending Bluetooth Low Energy Audio on Windows 11 and its role in this new shared audio feature, but the bottom line is that it's only supported on \"select Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs\" right no…",

Chances are, this is also where you headed for the earlier Scrappy upgrade that required lemons and apricots , though the olive trees are slightly larger than the fruit trees.

The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch.
