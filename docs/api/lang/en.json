On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift&#8217;s biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele’s 25 , which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015. Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2&nbsp;million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department , sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.
