    "body": "TL;DR Facer watch faces now support hourly chime sounds on Wear OS 6. The feature has to be enabled by watch face creators. Facer’s also got a new Fallout-themed Pip-Boy 3.0 watch face, complete with Face Chime sounds. At CES last week, smartwatch face platform Facer announced, among other things, a new feature it calls Face Chime , which lets watch face makers add custom chime sounds that play at the top of the hour to their faces. That feature is now available on Facer watch faces on Wear OS 6. Face Chime sounds are applied to watch faces by their creators, so only faces with sounds added support the feature — this update won’t let you add hourly chime sounds to watch faces on your own. Facer says there’ll be thousands of watch faces on its platform updated with Face Chime sounds over the next few weeks, though as of writing, it only highlights a couple dozen compatible faces.",

As the legend turns 80 on Monday (Jan. 19), Billboard reveals all the U.S.&nbsp;album charts that Parton has topped, and it is likely more than you think. Parton’s span of No. 1 albums extends more than 45 years, starting in 1977 and—so far— ending in 2024. The superstar has recorded and written music in several different genres, proving that her gorgeous, evanescent voice and unparalleled writing pen know no boundaries when it comes to musical styles. It took a full decade after her first album, the introductory 1967’s Hello, I’m Dolly, peaked at No. 11 on the Country Albums chart for Parton to reach the pinnacle. But then she was unstoppable: 11 of her albums have reached No. 1, sprawling across seven charts. Rockstar , which Parton said she made in response to being inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, hit the top of most charts at four, but she routinely hit multiple charts. For all her chart success, one major milestone has eluded Parton’s grasp so far: incredibly, she has never taken an album to the top of the Billboard 200. The closest she has c…",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year, Google announced that developers would have to register even when users are only sideloading their apps. Eventually Google backed down, and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Changes are coming to how Android users install apps outside the safety and protection of the Play Store. Google sounded the alarm last summer, warning the Android community that starting in 2026, even developers releasing apps for sideloading would have to register with Google . Following some immediate pushback, Google softened its stance a bit, ultimately agreeing to give informed users the option for an “advanced” installation flow that would support even unverified apps. And as we wait to see exactly how that’s going to work, we’re starting to spot some early pieces of it.

One streaming exec says only about 10% of Android users still cast content. Casting still matters to some people, but Netflix no longer seems to see it as essential. Netflix still hasn’t explained why it removed casting from its mobile apps last month , but a new report offers a pretty convincing answer. It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore. This speculation is based on reporting from Janko Roettgers of Lowpass , published via The Verge , who suggests declining usage might be behind the move. Roettgers writes that a streaming service operator told him at CES that casting was once essential to their service, but only around 10% of Android users still cast today.",

    "body": "Credit: Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority TL;DR A PDF document detailing promotions related to Samsung’s products was found on the company’s Colombian website. The document reveals the names of every model in the Galaxy S26 series. It confirms that neither a Galaxy S26 Pro nor a Galaxy S26 Edge device will launch with the S26 series. Leaks suggest that February 25 will likely be the day when Samsung launches the Galaxy S26 series. When that day comes, what devices will we see? In previous months, there was a lot of talk about a Galaxy S26 Edge replacing the usual Plus model. There were also leaks that suggested the base model could be rebranded as the Galaxy S26 Pro . We now know the answer thanks to a leak that came from none other than the phone maker itself. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These will be the worst phones of 2026 on an expectation-to-reality scale; we all expect Samsung to do better. The lack of significant upgrades also makes waiting for the regular Galaxy S26 a huge waste of time, in my opinion.

Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch. And while you can’t buy this phone, the engineering behind it offers an interesting glimpse of what highly specialized smartphones could be like in the future.",

    "body": "TL;DR Democratic lawmakers have asked the FTC to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising. The request centers on the still-unshipped T1 Phone and Trump Mobile’s handling of preorders and marketing. Lawmakers say the case should be treated like any other consumer protection issue, regardless of politics. My colleague C. Scott Brown ordered the T1 Phone back in June. Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices. The request comes in a letter (h/t The Verge ) from 11 Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Garcia. It focuses on Trump Mobile’s still-unreleased T1 Phone, announced more than six months ago and still accepting deposits despite not yet shipping anything to customers.",

It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device.

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

    "body": "TL;DR Researchers have found a vulnerability in Fast Pair implementation that could let bad actors connect to audio devices to eavesdrop or track victims’ locations. Google says it has “worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities.” Updates from audio device manufacturers are required to patch the vulnerability. It’s recommended users update their devices ASAP. The researchers say “many manufacturers have released patches for their impacted devices,” but to check with your device’s manufacturer to be sure. There’s a significant security vulnerability in many manufacturers’ implementation of Google’s Fast Pair protocol that could affect a wide variety of popular audio accessories. Security researchers at Belgian university KU Leuven have made public information about what they’ve dubbed WhisperPair, a set of cyber attacks that, leveraging a flaw in Fast Pair implementation, can be used to hijack audio devices, letting bad actors potentially track user location or eavesdrop on private conversations. As reported by Wired , researchers with KU Leuven’s Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group (COSIC) managed to exploit Google Fast Pair to connect to target dev…",

It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

This would be €50 cheaper than the Pixel 9a ‘s launch price. Now, there’s no guarantee that the new Pixel will be cheaper in the US as well, but it’s still encouraging news.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon.

Parents whose children are using supervised YouTube accounts can control these features on their kids’ devices, and today, YouTube announced some new options to let parents further restrict their kids’ viewing. In a blog post, YouTube outlined new limits on Shorts videos for supervised teen accounts (the YouTube Kids app doesn’t have a Shorts tab). Parents are able to set a daily limit on time kids can watch shorts videos, with the option to set that limit to zero — disabling the Shorts feed altogether — coming “soon.”",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",
