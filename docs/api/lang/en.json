The beloved international pop star finally joined TikTok this week and she did it in the most Celine way possible. In a 17-second video posted on Monday (Jan. 5), Dion officially launched her TikTok era with a fun clip in which she reintroduced herself. &#8220;My name is Céline,&#8221; Dion, 57, said while wearing a black hoodie from the French fashion house that happens to share her first name before rhetorically asking how old she is. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got kids,&#8221; said Dion, perched in front of a glowing skyline and adopting a cool kid pose as she channeled her 14-year-old twin sons pleading with her, &#8220;&#8216;We have to get you on TikTok!'&#8221; Miming confusion, Dion, said, &#8220;On TikTok?,&#8221; with a sampled voice behind her yelping &#8220;WHAT?!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of that before. Suddenly I&#8217;m becoming cool,&#8221; she added as a Seinfeld-like bass thump bubbled up behind her and digital sunglasses were superimposed on her face. &#8220;Céline Dion is cool. That&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; she announced with the perfect amount of winky incredulity. &#8220;TikTok here I come!…",

The rumored device is expected to arrive in Q4 2026, in line with the company’s conventional yearly release cycle. OnePlus had an interesting 2025. The company started strong with the OnePlus 13, 13R, and 13s, but then came along the OnePlus 15 and 15R , which left behind some of the highlights of their predecessors. While the new phones are only a few months old at this point, leaks have already begun to emerge for the successor to the OnePlus 15, and it appears the company could right some wrongs this year.

While it’s understandable to restrict video playback to prevent it from distracting users, there’s no reason it should restrict playback when the car is stationary or has its ignition turned off. Google, if it wanted, could place curbs on watching videos when it detects the car in motion. It already does that by preventing users from using the physical keyboard to search for a destination in Google Maps when the vehicle is in motion, and instead only allows using voice for search.",

In 1995, when defect rates for Samsung’s phones hit an all-time high, Lee figured out that all those speeches about quality he was making weren’t having the effect he was hoping for.

In addition to the already-leaked black and white colorways, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro may also come in an “Apricot” colorway. The special color appears limited to the Pro variant for now, with no hints for the regular model. Unlike its phones, which get updated every year, Samsung maintains a longer upgrade cycle for its premium wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 3 series was released nearly 18 months ago, which means the Galaxy Buds 4 should arrive soon. Although we aren’t clear on the timeline just yet, we’ve been seeing several references to the Galaxy Buds 4 and the Buds 4 Pro in Samsung’s One UI firmware for phones. While we recently learned about changes to the earbuds’ battery capacities and new head gestures , the recently released One UI 8.5 beta 3 provides more details.

According to new Luminate data, the song experienced a spike of nearly 500% in streams after soundtracking the end credits of the series’ final episode. Over the previous five months, “Heroes” had averaged approximately 94,000 daily streams. That figure jumped sharply in the days following the finale’s release, reaching roughly 342,000 streams on Jan. 1, 456,000 on Jan. 2, and 470,000 on Jan. 3 — representing a 3.6- to 5-times increase over its typical daily performance. The placement marked a full-circle moment for the series, which has become closely associated with 1980s music throughout its run. In earlier seasons, the show famously used a cover of “Heroes” by Peter Gabriel, making the finale’s use of Bowie’s original recording a deliberate callback. In an interview with Netflix’s Tudum, Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed that the idea to use Bowie’s version came from cast member Joe Keery, who plays Steve Harrington. “It was actually Joe Keery who suggested that we do…",

The display reportedly features a new metal plate design that reduces stress during folding, thereby removing the visible crease. This panel could show up in the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and may also be used in Apple’s first foldable iPhone. Foldable phones have come a long way, but there’s one design flaw that refuses to go away — the crease in the middle of the screen. At CES 2026 , Samsung Display may have finally cracked that problem. At its booth on the show floor of the tech show, Samsung Display is showcasing a brand-new foldable OLED panel that appears to have no visible crease at all. According to SamMobile , the difference is immediately noticeable when the new display is placed next to the one used on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 .",

The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series.

With uncompressed wireless 4K, up to 165Hz, G-Sync and FreeSync, and a much brighter OLED panel, the W6 doubles as a capable gaming display. LG is bringing back a product it quietly retired years ago, and this time, it’s addressing the issues that held it back. At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar. This was a disappointing design choice, especially for anyone with a high-end custom audio setup, since the soundbar became a useless extra you couldn’t get rid of.",

The telephoto camera is expected to remain largely the same, though the periscope zoom could receive a wider aperture. These rumored changes follow years of criticism regarding Samsung’s minimal hardware evolution in its flagship imaging systems. Samsung’s flagships have undergone minimal hardware evolution over the years, particularly in the camera department. The upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to disappoint with the same camera hardware, and super early leaks for the Galaxy S27 Ultra also painted the same picture. However, a new leak suggests that Samsung might finally stop being so lazy and actually provide us with a camera upgrade in the Galaxy S27 Ultra.

Now, the company is back with a smartphone. Say hello to the Clicks Communicator. The Clicks Communicator is a full-fledged Android smartphone, featuring an integrated physical keypad and a nearly square 4.03-inch OLED screen (1,080 x 1,200 pixels). Clicks explains that the phone can be used as a standalone device, but added that it was also designed for people who use two phones. In fact, the company says it envisions the Communicator as a communication-focused device (surprise) while your other phone is focused on entertainment and content capture.",

XREAL is a big player in the burgeoning AR glasses space, and today, ahead of CES, the company’s announcing a “mid-generation refresh” for its XREAL One glasses from late 2024. The new XREAL 1S glasses improve on the older pair in a lot of little ways, all while shaving a few bucks off the previous model’s price tag. Like the XREAL One, the XREAL 1S glasses plug into anything with USB-C video output, showing that output on micro-OLED displays just behind the glasses’ lenses to create a sort of virtual display. Compared to the older model, the 1S comes with better resolution 1200p per eye (up from 1080p); a wider, 52-degree field of view; and brighter micro-OLED displays that are now 16:10 rather than 16:9.",

There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

With the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset offering incredible performance in the year’s flagship phones , it’s great to see games finally take advantage of all that power. We also saw a few great lightweight mobile games released in 2025, although again, they were mostly ports. The Steam Frame hasn’t even been released yet, and we’re already seeing a blurring of the lines between Android games and PC games, and that trend is set to continue in the new year.",

After pushing back its deadline for installing the Bluetooth firmware twice, today is looking like the last official day you’ll be able to use Google’s flashing tool. Even after Google takes its tool offline, third-party efforts have preserved the Bluetooth firmware and allow you to host the flashing tool yourself. Cloud-based gaming is bigger than ever right now, whether you’re using services like Xbox Game Pass or just streaming games on your Switch . But despite this clearly being a viable business model, Google just couldn’t figure out how to make it work, and now we’re quickly coming up on the three-year anniversary of the company shutting down Stadia . While that was a very public failure for Google, the company still tried to make the best of the situation by giving Stadia hardware a new lease on life — and if you haven’t taken advantage of that yet, there’s an important deadline we’re running up against.

Even if you have the means to pick one up on a whim, just being a very fast car doesn’t necessarily make it the ideal vehicle for every occasion — god forbid you need to store anything in the trunk. That same situation applies to smartphones and the chips powering them. Every year, we see companies like Qualcomm introduce their latest silicon, trying to wow us with performance metrics that make the previous generation’s chips look positively glacial in comparison. That’s an important part of progress, absolutely, but just because there’s a new super-high-end option out there doesn’t mean it’s the best chip for the phone you need.",

The global race for 6G is slowly getting underway. But after 5G has so far failed to deliver on the truly next-gen experiences used to hype up its development cycle, the real question isn’t whether 6G can provide speeds in a lab — it’s whether it will meaningfully improve battery life, coverage, reliability, or monthly bills. On those fronts, the case for excitement is far less clear. Here’s everything that you need to know.",
