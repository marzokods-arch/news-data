If you long for the simpler times back when enemies just smoked you and got it over with, you might take a shine to Classicvania and Zelda-inspired adventure game Mina the Hollower , the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games. Speaking with Knowledge, Yacht Club co-founder Sean Velasco highlighted the game's simple control setup intended to \"take something old and rejig it,\" as reported by GamesRadar . \"There are limitations, but the limitations are what provide the fun,\" Velasco told Knowledge. \"Every game has a parry now. I played that new Doom, and even Doom has Dark Souls stuff in it … We didn't want to do something with a simple dodge-roll. We try to take something old and rejig it, do something interesting with it.\" To that end, Mina's maneuverability is limited; she can jump and burrow, and the rest is \"about getting that neutral space and playing it like a Castlevania or a Bloodbor…",

    "body": "Rory Norris, Guides Writer (Image credit: Future) Last week I was: getting stuck into Battlefield 6, testing out weapons and all the new maps in the launch version. This week I've been: trying to unlock every weapon in Battlefield 6 before Season 1. It's been almost four years since the last Battlefield game, 2042, and nearly a decade since the last truly great one. The multiplayer FPS landscape has changed a lot in that time, flip-flopping on concepts like 'hero' characters, movement, and more, but Battlefield 6 's insistence on returning to its series core was certainly the right thing to do. For one, it stole the Call of Duty Black Ops 7 beta's thunder, hitting a peak of 747k concurrent players on Steam alone. Despite this sweeping success, one criticism is shouted louder than all else: \"We want large maps\". It was, rightly so, a contentious topic during the beta, and it's only worsened since then, now that we've had our hands on what Battlefield Studios considers to be a big map. As a series veteran, I think it's safe to say that none of these maps are particularly large, and I do hope we get more diversity going forward. That said, I'd say Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and N…",

The technology's experimental use in the arts has already seen the advent of AI \"musicians\" like The Velvet Sundown , and you might wonder whether a veteran like Uematsu would be allured or even threatened by the ability to spin melodies so quickly with generative AI tools. As reported by Automaton , Uematsu told JASRAC he \"never used AI and probably never will … music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections.\" Uematsu has shared concerns about the changing face of videogame music before. Last year, he said there's a worrisome wave of game directors content with \"Hollywood-style\" music, adding even then that AI tools would prevent composers from \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\" More recently, he lamented a perceived stagnation in game music, with too many composers aping John Williams.

Now, Necesse is not done, exactly, but feature-complete as far as Fair Games' main plans for it went. The 1.0 update introduces multiple significant changes to its fantasy world, the biggest of which is, well, the world. Up to this point, Necesse's world was built from a limited scattering of islands. But the 1.0 update introduces a completely new system that generates an infinite, seamless map, letting you explore freely across a vast continent, journeying between its many biomes that are now designed to blend into one another rather than being separated out. Handily, Necesse supports migrating your existing world to the new generation format, though the developers encourage players to start a new game to experience the world afresh.

    "body": "Techland has released its post-launch roadmap for its free-running, zombie-dropkicking spinoff Dying Light: The Beast . As gaming roadmaps go, it's closer to what you'd scribble on the back of a packet of ciggies than the cartographical masterpieces produced by Ordnance Survey , with Techland's plans stretching over just 11 weeks. But this pencil-scrawl to your local newsagent nonetheless has a few landmarks worth visiting between now and the end of the year. The most significant of these is probably new game plus, which Techland describes as being \"highly anticipated\" in its Steam post detailing the roadmap. Personally, the absolute last thing I want to do after putting a 30+ hour game to bed is immediately start playing it again, but it appears I am in the minority on this. Elsewhere, the next few weeks will also introduce 'Legend Levels', a new nightmare difficulty, extra weapon executions, and ray tracing on PC. Techland doesn't specify precisely when each of these updates will arrive, but my guess is they'll be drip-fed alongside the roadmap's initial reveal—a series of weekly community challenges Techland has dubbed 'Call of the Beast'.

    "body": "Final Fantasy 7 Remake took the first eight or so hours of Final Fantasy 7 and expanded them into a 30-hour prestige RPG that, while it contained some quite skippable sidequests, added to the story in ways that made it even more impactful. The additions deepened character relationships and made you feel more attached to the setting. By contrast, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth took the original's second act and bloated it into 50+ hours of open world RPG filler. It wasn't just the optional tower-climbing and chocobo-stealthing stuff that made Rebirth feel stretched. Even if you stuck to the critical-path story you'd have to slog through Cait Sith throwing boxes around, an overlong final dungeon, and a plot you had to move through at a crawl—sometimes literally. Screenrant recently spoke to Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, and brought up some of these complaints. \"Regarding time management in certain sections,\" he replied, \"especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly.…",

Joe McGinn, who was senior game designer, gave it his seal of approval in the comments beneath the trailer . \"As the lead designer of the original game, I can only say ... this looks awesome! I want to play it\", he wrote. A demo of Futurama: Hit & Run will be available from October 19.

That Arc playtest compared favorably to a parallel Marathon playtest, as Morgan pointed out at the time , and was praised for its technical soundness. But the plan then was to release Arc in October (although the date hadn't yet been announced) and it stayed that way, because despite the fans angling for a surprise drop, it was \"absolutely not ready,\" design director Virgil Watkins told PC Gamer in an interview this week. \"It was interesting to see how many people wanted us to drop it, or even shortly after [the playtest], expected us to drop the game,\" said Watkins. \"But on our end, the game was absolutely not ready. I'm happy that a lot of people thought the game ran well, but we had a lot of optimization to still do. We had a bunch of features we still needed to finish.

That leads me to a second problem: The odds of Arc Raiders ever getting a first-person mode are basically zero. That little spot of disappointment comes from Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins, who told PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde in a recent interview that the game was built around the third-person perspective, and that shifting to a first-person view doesn't \"give us a benefit of any sort.\" \"I think so much of our immersion and world and the interactions that your character has with the things in the world, the enemies, the other players, is so amplified by the quality that's come from our animation team and our audio team and our environment team, that it works together as this very nice package that you can really place your character in that world,\" Watkins said. \"That's not to say that's not possible in first per…",

Even games in big, mainstream series often sound bizarre the moment you stop to actually think about them. Resident Evil Village? Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2? Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below? Nonsense, the lot of it. I've decided to run a little test of how silly things have gotten. In this quiz, you just need to find the real game titles sprinkled among my ostentatious fake ones. Are my lies as convincing as the average Steam new releases page?

When that suit was filed, the team behind the private server issued a statement: \"Turtle WoW is here to stay.\" Yesterday, October 17, they issued another: An open letter to Blizzard itself, requesting a licensing framework for fan mods and private servers. The letter, which you can find in full on the front page of the Turtle WoW website, gets into the history and arguable inevitability of fanmade mods. \"Many successful games have a modding community. It is a part of gaming culture and a testament to the game's quality, and the community's passion,\" The Turtle WoW team argues. \"The World of Warcraft modding community is flourishing, and as more tools become available, it will only continue to grow.

    "body": "Metal Gear Solid 5 isn't exactly short of options for approaching its open-ended stealth scenarios. But encouraging players to use every tool at their disposal can be difficult once they've found a loadout that they like. Its Subsistence rule was one of Kojima's solutions to this, allowing players to re-enter previous missions without a specific loadout and forcing them to scavenge weapons and equipment on the fly. But this solution didn't go far enough, at least according to MGS 5 modder mohtalgear. And to celebrate the sequel's tenth anniversary, they decided to do something about it, resulting in the Definitive Subsistence Update . The Definitive Subsistence Update aims to be the equivalent of the Substance and Subsistence updates for MGS 2 and 3. \"Definitive Subsistence adds new content and new meaningful gameplay mechanics that'll make you feel like you're playing MGSV for the first time,\" mohtalgear says in its Nexus Mods description. It does this by layering in substantially more detail to the Subsistence system, as well as several other mechanics central to how Metal Gear Solid 5 functions.

If you haven't seen Sorcerer, I strongly recommend you check it out. But in the meantime, you can think of Nitroglycerine! as a mix of Snowrunner and Baby Steps . The playable demo skips the surprisingly long setup of Friedkin's film, planting your straight in the cabin of a snorting, grunting '70s flatbed loaded with a single crate of pure liquid concussion. You're then tasked with navigating a twisting morass of slippery, crumbling dirt tracks with nothing but a crude map and nerves of steel. You get three trucks and three opportunities with which to complete the journey, while gas stations you pass serve as checkpoints.

The studio has worked minor miracles with handheld ports too, most notably the Nintendo Switch version of 2020's Doom Eternal . That said, The Dark Ages was the first Doom game to be fully and constantly ray-traced, making it a less obvious candidate for handheld gaming when it launched. While it ran well enough on most PC hardware and could even deliver reasonable framerates on a cheap gaming laptop, as Andy Edser noted in his PC performance analysis , the Steam Deck nonetheless struggled to meet its minimum requirements, and as such performance was underwhelming. But that's all changed, apparently. Update 2.2 introduces several handheld-centric optimisations and quality-of-life features.

Specifically, you're a house who eats furniture, loves fishing, and even knows how to jump. As a house, you roll around this island at sometimes ridiculous speeds, chatting with different buildings and going on dates with them. I saw Building Relationships at Gamescom Asia x Thailand Games Show on Saturday. It's a funny game but, crucially, it's not just funny because you're a building. It's also funny in the same way Baby Steps is: there's something inherently comical about the moment-to-moment movement, the bonkers physics, and the sense that you're always in control but only just. When the seductive protagonist does find a date—perhaps with a charismatic windmill, or a friendly manor, or a \"himbo\" tent—the process proceeds as a mini-game. For example, as my house dined with a grand old abode, I had to put together a flat-pack table for my romantic interest to eat (because buildings eat furniture, obviously). Building Relationships is predominantly the work of Thai developer Tanat Boozayaangool, who cites A Short Hike as inspiration. \"It's a he…",

Yeah, Garland is currently busy with 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, but that's due to be released in January 2026, and while a third movie in that trilogy is planned, it's not a guarantee. Elden Ring could—and please keep in mind I am basing this on absolutely nothing but my …",

That number, courtesy of SteamDB , is good enough to put Arc Raiders in the number four spot on Steam's most played list , ahead of PUBG, Rust, and Bongo Cat. It's even more impressive when you consider that the server slam is also available on the Epic Games Store as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, meaning the actual number of people playing is higher—likely much higher. Despite the enviable crush of players, the test seems to be going very well. Embark Studios pushed a hotfix shortly after the playtest started to address crashes and errors, which unfortunately required a \"full redownload\" of the game, but said that \"should not be the norm moving forward.\" Since that patch, though, there's been no indication of big issues: Two of our best men, Morgan Park and Lincoln Carpenter, are apparently spending their Friday, uhh, testing the game , and say they haven't run into any issues.

Sora has been used to produce videos featuring Dr. King's likeness delivering the \"I have a dream\" speech while making monkey noises ; another video shows him fighting his contemporary and fellow activist Malcolm X. OpenAI has admitted this sort of stuff amounts to \"disrespectful depictions\", which is putting it mildly, and says it's stopped users being able to generate videos featuring Dr. King's likeness \"as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures.\" Dr. King is far from the only historical figure to have been reanimated in oft-tasteless fashion.

The answer came in July 2025 when Sony filed suit , shortly after which Tencent did something unusual: It purged most of the Horizon-like content from the game's Steam page, and delayed its launch target from late 2025 to late 2027—all without saying a word about why, or even acknowledging it was being done at all. The \"why\" seemed obvious enough: Light of Motiram really did look an awful lot like Horizon: Zero Dawn, in some very overt ways. Despite Tencent's lack of comment, I assumed the store page changes, and the huge two-year delay, represented a fairly complete walkback and rework. But it seems that Sony isn't buying it: As reported by Games Fray , Sony has now filed for a preliminary injunction against Tencent's use of any material \"copied or derived\" from the Horizon games. That covers a lot of ground, but the filing focuses heavily on Tencent's use of a character in Light of Motiram promotional images who looks a lot like Alo…",

When the housing system launches, players will earn decor relating to achievements and existing in-game content: but this will also work retroactively, so achievements earned now will count toward furniture when housing goes live. The housing system is already live on WoW's Public Test Realm for the early birds, so players know what these achievements are. I'm sure you can see where this is going. A new add-on called Home Bound by Bettiold ( available on CurseForge ) essentially tells players which achievements they should be gunning for in the runup to the release of the full housing system, whereupon they'll be showered with all their hard-earned furniture.

They just do their thing and we rarely give them a moment's thought, until they ruin a Steam download, of course. I felt very much the same way until I recently reviewed three new devices from TP-Link: two mesh systems, the Deco BE68 and Deco BE25 BE5000 , and the Archer BE9700 . Using two Intel Core Ultra 200S gaming PCs to test the wireless performance of them, I came away seriously impressed by just how easy they were to set up, how ridiculously quick they were, and perhaps most importantly, how affordable they were compared to the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 gaming routers. Take the Archer BE9700. You can buy one of those for $200 at Best Buy . That's genuinely very little money for such a capable Wi-Fi 7 router.

It's not a guarantee of a smooth-sailing launch day (Dune: Awakening also reminded us of that ), but it's at least an attempt, and also a way of rooting out any overlooked issues that might trigger surprise headaches.

The term 'AI PC' has always been a struggle to define, ranging from Microsoft's earlier assertion that an AI PC must have an NPU with at least 45 TOPS of processing power to meet the qualification (that rules out most AMD-chipped desktop machines, then) to whether it's got a physical Copilot button on the keyboard. The good news is, MS seems to think we'll all have an AI PC soon, thanks to Copilot. Well, as long as you're running the latest version of Windows 11, that is. If I were a cynical man, I'd say it was almost like the term had no viable definition in the first place and merely served as a marketing tool to boost new PC sales.

Surprisingly well, that is, compared to just not working at all or being entirely unplayable, which is what I would have expected for such an old card in most modern, good-looking games. We do, the YouTuber explains, need to make \"some pretty big visual sacrifices\" to achieve a relatively solid 60 fps. To my eyes, though, those visual sacrifices aren't ones that make the game unplayable. They essentially mean dropping the resolution down low, which will, of course, make the game look quite jagged and pixelated, but even on the lowest settings, the actual visuals, such as textures, still seem to look half-decent. The AMD Radeon RX 570 has just 4 GB of VRAM, but Battlefield 6 doesn't use more than this when it's set to the lowest settings at 1080p.

Ghouls 4 Games will take that good work in a pair of stick-on vampire teeth for the spookiest season with three major events between October 24 and November 7. First up is the Halloween Bash Showcase, which'll be airing October 24 at 12 pm PT / 8 pm GMT. This scare-infused showcase will feature only the best games from the crypts of its featured developer's web-stricken mausoleums (some might call them 'studios') in a proud display of artistry, innovation, and diversity. Joining the showcase as a guest host is Samantha Beart, who you might know as Karlach from Baldur's Gate 3—you know, big, tall, capable of punting a mindflayer thirty feet with a well-placed boot. That one. The second part of the event will take place over on Steam with the Halloween Bash Steam Event—live from Octobe…",

    "body": "As a man who lives with one foot firmly in the past, little excites me more than an old game suddenly getting some out-of-the-blue new update. Obsidian suddenly returning to Pillars of Eternity 1 earlier this year? Pretty much the best thing that's ever happened to me. And now Nightdive has sprung up to slap a \"definitive\" update on ancient adventure game I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. This is a year of three Christmases for ol' Josh. A point-and-click adventure based on Harlan Ellison's novel about a group of humans subjected to eternal torment by a misanthropic AI, voiced in the game by Ellison himself, I Have No Mouth has become a bit of a cult classic since its release in 1995. This is Nightdive's first patch for it since 2018, and the patch notes are actually pretty few. That doesn't mean they're not significant, though. In essence, the patch updates the PC version of the game to match the console editions released in March this year. That means navigable menus, improved controller support, and in general an experience more suited to 2025 than 1995. It feels good! I've messed around with it a little, and the experience of playing a PC point-and-click adventure on a gamepa…",

And people have been waiting for your return. You wake up in 21st century Seattle, bound by a curse and weighed down by the expectations of modern bloodsuckers. Amid all this, you must carve out a place for yourself in this new city, along with an identity, even as you're nudged into deals and alliances, bending and adapting as you try to become what Seattle's nighttime residents need: a big scary vamp who can fix everything. Or break everything. The story of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2's lost protagonist eerily encapsulates the state of the game itself: a long-awaited sequel with years of hopes and doubts and assumptions bearing down on it; an RPG that has to be an RPG, has to be a sequel, that strains against its bonds.
