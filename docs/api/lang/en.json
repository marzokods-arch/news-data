Of course, a lot has changed in the last eight years — Apple has finally embraced AI, albeit with mixed results, and Google has obviously leaned heavily into its Tensor Processor Unit for everything from imaging to on-device language translation. Ask any of the big tech companies, from Arm and Qualcomm to Apple and Samsung, and they’ll all tell you that AI is the future of smartphone hardware and software.",

It wasn’t just the premium choice, it was the safe choice, and frankly, the only choice that made sense if you needed a solid balance of hardware and software. But over the last month, I’ve done something that would have seemed unthinkable to me a year ago. I left my iPad at home and have been carrying around the OnePlus Pad Go 2 instead. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 isn't just cheaper, it might actually be better for what I do. At roughly $400, this really should not be a fair fight. My iPad setup cost nearly three times as much once you factor in the keyboard and Apple Pencil. Yet, for my specific workflow, which revolves heavily around on-the-go learning, research, and capturing spontaneous ideas, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is not just a cheaper alternative — it honestly might just be the better tool. Making the switch from an iPad to a utilitarian mid-range Android tablet might not please my brand and ecosystem-conscious mind, but the reality is that it does everything I …",

Eventually Google backed down, and offered to give advanced users an option for manual installs from unknown sources. Ahead of that rolling out, we’re seeing Google Play begin to prepare for this system’s arrival. Changes are coming to how Android users install apps outside the safety and protection of the Play Store. Google sounded the alarm last summer, warning the Android community that starting in 2026, even developers releasing apps for sideloading would have to register with Google . Following some immediate pushback, Google softened its stance a bit, ultimately agreeing to give informed users the option for an “advanced” installation flow that would support even unverified apps. And as we wait to see exactly how that’s going to work, we’re starting to spot some early pieces of it.

It wasn’t going to ditch a popular feature, so the most likely reason is that not many people are using it anymore.

Despite their new names, the chipsets repackage designs from previous generations with minimal upgrades. The move appears inspired by Qualcomm’s recent launch of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. Over the years, MediaTek’s flagship Dimensity chips have improved enough to put up a tough fight against Qualcomm’s Elite mobile chips. The latest Dimensity 9500 proved to be too close to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 in our testing. Now, just a few months after its release, MediaTek is launching a slightly less powerful variant, the Dimensity 9500s, likely geared towards affordable flagships. Along with it, MediaTek has also launched the Dimensity 8500, which might be geared towards the upper mid-range. Dimensity 9500 The Dimensity 9500s is built on TSMC’s N3E 3nm process, the same as the 9500, and maintains the same CPU architecture with “all big cores.” But instead of deploying Arm’s flagship and the newest C1 cores, the Dimensity 9500s uses older Cortex-X925 at 3.73GHz for the prime core, complemented by three Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Arm Cortex-A720 cores at undisclosed clock speeds.

The design features a unique trifold form with three separate displays, allowing a streamer to view chat, gameplay, and metrics simultaneously. While the bill of materials is ~$1,838, the total R&amp;D to bring it to life is estimated at a staggering $55 million. Imagine if a phone company really paid attention to its wildest customer ideas. That’s exactly what Nothing did. In a recent video, it took a suggestion from popular streamer IShowSpeed ( like it recently did with YouTuber MrWhoseTheBoss ) and turned it into a full phone concept, complete with a 3D model and a surprisingly high estimated price. The video presents the project as a fun challenge rather than a product launch.

    "body": "TL;DR Democratic lawmakers have asked the FTC to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising. The request centers on the still-unshipped T1 Phone and Trump Mobile’s handling of preorders and marketing. Lawmakers say the case should be treated like any other consumer protection issue, regardless of politics. My colleague C. Scott Brown ordered the T1 Phone back in June. Seven months later, he still doesn’t have the Trump phone , a shipping date, or much clarity on what he actually paid a $100 deposit for. Now, that long-running mess may be about to draw federal scrutiny, after Democratic lawmakers asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile over alleged false advertising and deceptive practices. The request comes in a letter (h/t The Verge ) from 11 Democratic lawmakers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Garcia. It focuses on Trump Mobile’s still-unreleased T1 Phone, announced more than six months ago and still accepting deposits despite not yet shipping anything to customers.",

It also seems to want to be a bit more than that at times, so we decided to poll you about how you feel about it. We’ve already made our feelings clear on the subject after our own Joe Maring spent some hands-on time with Project Ava at CES 2026. While he found parts of the tech genuinely interesting, like its ability to quickly scan game menus and suggest loadouts, the overall experience left him more creeped out than impressed. The giggling, the attempts at playful banter, and the clear push toward forming a “bond” with the AI overshadowed the more practical gaming-assistant side of the device.

The carrier bundles for the beta suggest Apple has added a new setting that would allow carriers to enable encryption for RCS for secure conversations between iPhone and Android. However, it appears that only four carriers (all residing outside of the US) have this line of code, and none of them have flipped the switch yet. Shortly after the GSMA announced new Universal Profile 3.0 specifications for RCS last March, Apple committed to adding support for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in future updates. While that was good to hear, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far in the future Apple is talking about. We spotted code back in August showing that Apple was testing the same Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption in iOS 26 that Google added to Google Messages. But here we are, still waiting for the feature to arrive. However, a new leak suggests that secure cross-platform RCS messaging between iPhones and Androids is another step closer to reality.

It’s the emulator’s biggest update yet, with many improvements across platforms. One of the most significant changes finally reduces input latency on Android devices. Nintendo 3DS emulation has seen a major resurgence in interest with dual-screen gaming handhelds like the AYN Thor and Pocket DS coming out, but its best emulator hasn’t seen a new stable release in five months. Today, that streak ends, with Azahar Release 2124 dropping what its developers promise to be its “largest update ever.” One of the most significant changes for Android users is a simple default settings tweak, which yields a noticeable decrease in input latency. Previous versions had Vsync enabled by default as a way to reduce screen tearing in games. However, Android has its own frame pacing feature that performs a similar function. It has now been disabled by default, with the code around it cleaned up and consolidated.",

    "body": "Credit: Adamya Sharma / Android Authority TL;DR We were able to get our first look at Android’s upcoming Intrusion Logging feature. It records security incidents and logs key activities that could be linked to data breaches. The feature is designed to help users who deal with sensitive data, such as journalists, government officials, or business owners. Android typically gets bashed for being less secure than iOS, which can often influence those who deal wth sensitive data to choose an iPhone instead. To clear itself of this reputation, Google announced Intrusion Detection last year as a feature that helps users track whether their private data was exposed to hackers or whether their device was compromised. Despite being announced before Android 16’s launch, the feature has yet to roll out to users. But we have our first look at Android’s Intrusion Logging features, along with some information about how it could work.

With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

    "body": "Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) has little to no competition for those of us who prefer the Android platform. The only reason we don’t recommend it in our list of the best smartwatches is that it may be overkill for most people, and the retail price is excessive. What if you could get it for nearly the same price as a Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, though? Buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 for just $329.99 ($320 off)",

The Documents section is where your Deep Research reports and Canvas creations will be stored. In December 2025, we conducted an APK teardown of the Google app, which revealed that some tweaks to Gemini could be coming in the future. These tweaks involved a new layout for the “My Stuff” folder. Instead of everything you’ve created being lumped together, this new layout would introduce separate sections for “Media,” “Documents,” and “Purchases.” It appears this update is starting to roll out now.

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung quietly updated the footnotes of its Galaxy AI support documents to confirm basic features will remain free forever. This shuts the door on a subscription or paywall being added to basic Galaxy AI features, something that was a possibility under the old language. Samsung could still offer new, paid Galaxy AI features in the future. This updated language doesn’t cover third-party features, either. Samsung’s Galaxy AI suite first launched alongside the Galaxy S24 lineup, and it includes a mix of on-device and cloud features powered by Samsung and Google. Some, like Circle to Search, have since made their way to other Android phones, while many remain a Samsung exclusive. While these features have been free for owners of eligible devices since Galaxy AI debuted, Samsung always left the door open to making them paid tools in the future. The company appears to be closing that door with a quiet update to the footnotes of its Galaxy AI landing page . Originally, the first footnote clarified that “use of AI features is complimentary through 2025.” It also noted that a “purchase may be required after the complimentary period.” These statements were listed on the Galaxy AI pag…",
