    "body": "Rolling Stone ’s Musicians on Musicians took over the Beacon Theatre in New York City Thursday (Oct. 23) night for its third annual edition. Hosted by Saturday Night Live ’s James Austin Johnson (whom you know for his spot-on impersonations of President Trump), the night brought the magazine’s latest issue – which features 10 musicians paired off in twos having frank, revealing conversations with each other about art and the music industry – to life on stage. Of the pairings who hit the stage at the Beacon were RS cover stars Hayley Williams and Jack Antonoff as well as Role Model and María Zardoya of the Marías. Each musician-on-musician duo sat down for a chat (the stage was done up to resemble a living room—chairs, coffee table, even a potted plant) before picking up their guitars and ripping through five-or-so songs apiece. Zardoya’s ethereal, assured voice was a revelation in the venue’s recently improved acoustics, and Role Model’s band did justice to the Marías’ songs in the absence of her bandmates. Role Model himself was reserved and coy in the conversation portion of the night, but he had the audience on its feet and eating out of the palm of his hand when he grabbed the…",

If YouTube TV and Disney can’t come to an agreement before the end of October 30, subscribers will face a blackout. Google successfully managed talks with NBCUniversal, Fox, and Paramount previously in 2025. YouTube TV is a popular live TV streaming service that helps subscribers cut the cord, but it’s struggling to keep legacy channels on board. It wrangled with NBCUniversal earlier this month, and had similar public battles with Fox and Paramount over distribution rights in 2025. Now, YouTube TV is undergoing similar negotiations with Disney. Google this week announced it is negotiating with Disney to keep networks like ESPN and ABC available on YouTube TV. The company’s current distribution deal expires on October 30 at 11:59 PM ET, and both sides are warning of a blackout if a “fair deal” isn’t reached.",

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

The smartphone has become our modern Swiss Army knife, bundling practically unlimited disparate functions into a single pocketable device.

In emergency situations, the phone part of the smartphone is all the more important — but Google’s phones are reportedly having a hard time there. Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through. These reports are anecdotal, but any failed call to 911 could potentially have disastrous consequences.",

YouTube recently introduced a new player UI on the web , with stark changes, especially to the icons. While YouTube calls these new elements “more expressive,” many users can’t resist calling them unsightly and cartoonish . Regardless of the latter group’s views, YouTube is starting to roll out a similar design refresh to its mobile apps.

Based on the name, you might think this is just a basic refresh with maybe a smaller size or a new minor feature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Plus model does everything the original TWO did, yes, but brings in a new capability that makes it pretty much indispensable for anyone: Apple CarPlay support. Finally, multi-OS families won’t need two different dongles or need to fight over whether Android or iOS gets preferential treatment in the car. Now, everyone can live in harmony.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

With One UI 8.5, Samsung may let you assign a higher priority to specific notifications, based on the feature added to a recently leaked One UI 8.5 build. As spotted by Sammyguru , the “Prioritize notification” option could be toggled on to set certain notifications as important.",

But it’s still lacking some key features, like multiple profiles and tab groups, which OpenAI is now working to fix.

For as useful as these systems can be when it comes to organizing information, and as impressive as the content is that generative AI can seemingly pull out of nowhere, we don’t have to look far before we start noticing all the blemishes in this otherwise polished facade.

The Lite plan’s best rate requires an active Verizon voice line; otherwise, it costs $10 more per month. Speeds are capped at 25Mbps and aimed at rural users who previously relied on DSL or satellite connections. It seems every cellular carrier is pushing home internet hard these days. Even Mint Mobile recently announced plans for its own low-cost home internet service starting at just $30 a month when prepaid annually. Not one to be one-up in pricing in seems, Verizon has now announced a more competitive Lite plan that starts at just $25 a month. Unlike Mint, you don’t have to pay annually for this rate either.

An Infoblox report states that it behaves like malware, with keylogging features and disabled security tools. The browser has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, with ties to illegal gambling sites. A web browser claiming to keep your data safe may be doing exactly the opposite. According to a new investigation, an app called Universe Browser, which has reportedly been downloaded millions of times, surreptitiously installs dangerous software and routes your internet traffic through servers in China. The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The researchers say the ‘privacy browser’ behaves a lot like malware, with features that resemble keylogging, secret connections to external servers, and background activity that alters device settings. It even blocks features like right-click menus and developer tools, and disables key browser security protections.",

While Verizon and T-Mobile seem engaged in an active and dynamic battle for our cellular souls, AT&amp;T is a bit different. It continues to build out a stable cellular and fiber network and has even managed a few important acquisitions, but it does it in a way that’s much quieter and pretty boring on the surface. Now it seems it’s finally ready to make a little noise, as AT&amp;T has announced a massive new campaign designed to go after T-Mobile for its so-called “Untruths”.

Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations.

I’m kind of surprised that we haven’t seen this yet considering that an integration like this would give YouTube Music a leg up on Spotify , helping it close the market share gap that’s huge at the moment. A flawless AI experience within YouTube Music would help me find what I’m looking for faster and would just create a better experience overall.",

Not because GrapheneOS doesn’t deliver on its promises, but because it practically requires you to buy Google’s Pixel line of smartphones to use it. For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",

Eartips are $20. Replacements were previously available through a self-service support tool. Google’s been working to gradually make its hardware products a little less wasteful: its latest Pixel 10 is more repairable than previous models , and after three generations of smartwatches that more or less couldn’t be repaired at all, Pixel Watch 4 repairs can even be done at home . Tiny earbuds are a little trickier to service, but Google’s taken a step to make sure you don’t have to throw out a whole set of Pixel Buds if you lose any individual piece of it. 9to5Google has spotted that replacement parts for Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a are now available on the Google Store, replacing a more cumbersome self-service support form.",

The creation comes from u/Neo4114, who shared their homemade Pip-Boy face on the r/PixelWatch subreddit . They said it was their first watch face and that it took “many hours” to perfect, and we certainly think the result looks impressive enough to pass as an official release.

    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

In this image, taken by the JunoCam instrument from about 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) above the moon, Io’s night side [left lobe] is illuminated by “Jupitershine,” which is sunlight reflected from the planet’s surface. This image is the NASA Science Image of the Month for October 2025 . Each month, NASA’s Science Mission Directorate chooses an image to feature, offering desktop wallpaper downloads, as well as links to related topics, activities, and games.
