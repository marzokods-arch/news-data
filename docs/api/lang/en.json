Credit: NASA A new NASA study of its Apollo lunar soils clarifies the Moon’s record of meteorite impacts and timing of water delivery. These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith . They learned that even under generous assumptions, meteorite delivery since about four billion years ago could only have supplied a small fraction of Earth’s water. The Moon serves as an ancient archive of the impact history …",

At the time, enabling this look took some tinkering — but now, the new light theme is rolling out publicly in multiple versions of the Photos Android app. The editing view for Google Photos has historically featured a dark gray background. That’s easier on the eyes when using your phone in a dark room, but it might not always be what you want. After an apparent server-side update that’s hitting users this week, that background will match your device theme: dark gray on dark mode, light gray for light mode.",

The off-Sun angle of the solar arrays resulted in a slow discharge of TESS’s batteries.

However, as it grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage or sort, which is why Google has been building search functionality for Wallet for quite some time.

REDMAGIC 11 Pro: The best gaming phone overall If you want the best performing gaming phone on the market, look no further than the REDMAGIC 11 Pro. I was blown away by the performance on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and it’s the only phone I’ve tested so far that can handle the thermal load of Qualcomm’s latest chipset. The realme GT8 Pro provided wildly inconsistent results under stress, and the OnePlus 15 simply shut down in the middle of our benchmark test (although this was fixed in later updates ).",

Despite how they divide opinion, the majority of you in that survey did think they offered some benefit, and Duolingo is far from the only option on the market. Whichever you favor, we wanted to know more about your habits, so we polled you again on how often you actually engage with your language learning app of choice. That question was prompted by Stephen Headrick’s recent article about trying Speak , a Duolingo alternative that takes a very different approach to language learning. Rather than leaning heavily on gamified drills and fill-in-the-blank exercises, Speak puts speaking front and center, using AI-powered conversations to push you to actually say things out loud. Stephen found that focus particularly useful for building his confidence to practice in the real world.",

General availability starts in March. Need another device in your home to make noise at you throughout the day? Nintendo’s got you covered. Following an initial tease in September, pre-orders are now open for the company’s Talking Flower toy. Based on a chatty character from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the gadget will pipe up every half hour or so to tell you the time, quote lines from the game, or just kind of say whatever. An overview video published by Nintendo today explains what the Talking Flower can do. The video says that when active, the toy will talk “about twice per hour.” It’ll say different things based on the time of day or the temperature of the room it’s placed in, or on demand when you press its button. It seems, well, annoying — and if you’ve played Wonder, you’ll know that’s a faithful adaptation of the character.",

Watching an epic action movie with the sound off just isn’t the same — the right music can really elevate an experience to the next level. Not all of us are musically inclined, though, which is why we were so excited when Google introduced a new feature for its Recorder app with the Pixel 10 that used AI to help us create music . Late last year, we saw access extend to Pixel 9 handsets , and now we’re checking out what could be an even bigger expansion for tools like this.

    "body": "Rumors around Samsung’s upcoming midrange Galaxy A57 have been circulating for months, but the last few weeks gave us more clarity about what to expect, including a full-blown spec sheet that shows an impressive set of features like 45W charging and a large 4,900mAh battery in a slim 6.9mm body. All of this is excellent news for the Galaxy A57, but guess what? These upgrades trample all over the upcoming Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus. This got me thinking: Has Samsung essentially given up on its Galaxy S series? Not the Ultra, of course, but the basic S and S Plus models? Is innovation dead for these phones?",

Additionally, the “Contribute” tab could also receive a UI update that harmonizes colors and hides the bio input box for existing profiles. Part of what makes Google Maps such an excellent tool for travel and commuting is the abundance of crowd-sourced data. Features like incident reports help add a layer of real-time, community-based input to the navigation service. However, users have little control over the incident reports they’ve submitted, as there is no option to delete them later. Incident reports “fade” over time as other users confirm or deny them, but, generally speaking, there’s no way to delete submitted reports.

With that in mind, we set out to discover which feature from another brand you want on your Pixel. Android Authority contributor Zac Kew-Denniss got the ball rolling by giving you some options. His article last month broke down the seven features from other phones he wanted to see on his next Pixel , and he turned that shortlist into a poll to see which ideas resonated most with you. His suggestions included everything from motion gestures to widget stacks, and you should check out his article to understand his reasoning.

The irony is that the best UST projectors still require something many homes don’t have: space. After a week with AWOL Vision’s Aetherion Max, it became clear that I don’t have a room with a wall large enough, or a layout flexible enough, to fully take advantage of what this projector can do. And if a review unit can genuinely make you contemplate the whole layout of your home to try and keep it in use, that’s a really good sign. If you have the room, the Aetherion is one of the most technically impressive projectors I’ve used.",

On Android, however, I struggle to find apps with uniquely designed experiences. As long as the app technically does what it’s intended to do, it gets a passing grade for most people. I’ve long wanted to see that change, and I think the only way that happens is if Google leads from the top. Material 3 Expressive shows Google is recognizing design’s importance more than ever before — I prefer it to Apple’s Liquid Glass — but it only matters if the design system is applied to the apps we use every day.

To get the ball rolling, our own Hadlee Simons gave his breakdown when we ran the poll, ranking major Android brands from worst to best based on how their 2025 played out. He obviously considered the hardware side, but also things like software support, strategy, and whether the brand actually seemed to be moving in the right direction. He ultimately concluded that no OEM deserved the top spot, but second and third positions went to Samsung and OnePlus, respectively. More on the latter of those a bit later, but first, let’s see how closely (or not) you agreed with Hadlee’s analysis by looking at the outcome of that poll.",
