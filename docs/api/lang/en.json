The union results in a colorful, rhythmic and festive song that celebrates the spirit of Santa Marta and that city, the oldest in Colombia, on its 500th anniversary. The impeccable fusion between the organic and the electronic sounds, distinctive of the band led by vocalist Li Saumet, highlights the Caribbean drums, synthesizers and vallenato-style guitars converging at the same point. The lyrics, meanwhile, reflect the emotional bond of its performers with that mystical land at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, and the nostalgia they feel every time they return.
