    "body": "Music executive Ángel Del Villar is asking a judge to let him stay out of prison while he appeals his felony convictions for doing business with a concert promoter linked to Mexican drug cartels. With a four-year prison sentence set to start on Dec. 1, attorneys for Del Villar argue that his appeal could very well overturn his March convictions – and that he should remain a free man until a higher court rules on his case. “Del Villar has demonstrated since this case began that he is not a flight risk,” his lawyers wrote in a Wednesday court filing. “He poses no danger to the community. And he intends to present substantial questions on appeal that, if resolved in his favor, are likely to result in reversal or a new trial on all counts.” Related Drake Lawsuit Ruling, Maverick City Case, Taylor Swift Song Debate &amp; More Top Music Law&nbsp;News Solange Appointed First Scholar-in-Residence at USC Thornton School of Music Sia&#039;s Estranged Husband Wants $260,000 Per Month to Maintain &#039;Upper-Class Lifestyle&#039; Del Villar, who built his Del Records into a top record label for regional Mexican music, was convicted in March of violating the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designati…",

The promo seems targeted mainly at legacy Simple Choice users, giving older plan holders a rare chance to qualify for a major deal. Unfortunately, it isn’t listed in the T-Life app for most users, and must be confirmed through a rep (call or text 611). T-Mobile might offer a wide range of phone deals and promotions, but most of the time, there are clear restrictions on who is eligible. Some deals require a higher-end plan to qualify, but nearly every offer requires at least a current entry-level plan. This usually means customers with older, legacy plans are left out in the dark.

In an exclusive with Billboard , Kota revealed on Thursday (Oct. 16) that he will serve as the halftime performer during the Nets opening game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Oct. 24. &#8220;Performing at the Brooklyn Nets home opener feels like a full-circle moment,&#8221; Kota tells Billboard in a statement. &#8220;It’s crazy because I went to high school literally just a few blocks away in one direction, and I grew up just blocks away in the other direction, at a time when I was dreaming big and making music in my room. Being on the Barclays Center court right here in my hometown &#8212; that’s what Brooklyn energy is all about.” While the Nets have always taken pride in elevating local talent and spotlighting artists with direct ties to the borough, Kota&#8217;s performance will come as part of a broad strategy this season to celebrate Brooklyn in a massive way. The Nets announced they&#8217;re collaborating with the estate of The Notorious B.I.G. on a series of Biggie Nights for this season. The campaign will kick off on Nov. 11 at Barclays C…",

Initially funded via Kickstarter, it will be available later today to pre-order for $149.99 on the Ohsnap website. Mobile controllers have become more popular over the years as more controller-compatible Android games, emulators, and cloud gaming applications have hit the market. Most are simple telescopic controllers, but MCON is the first option in years with an entirely new design. With a look that harkens back to sliding handhelds like the PSP Go, Xperia Play, or even the recent ANBERNIC RG Slide , MCON attaches to the back of your phone via MagSafe magnets, then slides out with a spring-loaded “switchblade” mechanism in the back. This allows it to tuck away neatly when not in use, while still providing full-size controls when you need them.",

Shockingly, mere five months after its launch, reports suggest that Samsung has killed the Edge line . That means no further production of the Galaxy S25 Edge beyond existing stock, and no plans to launch its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. One can argue that five months is too short a period to judge the performance of a phone line. So, was Samsung right to cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge? Reports suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge sold only 1.31 million units since its launch in May, up to August. The first three months after launch are where most smartphone sales are concentrated, so this was seemingly enough of a runway for Samsung to assess the S25 Edge’s sales performance. In contrast, the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra sold 8.28 million, 5.05 million, and 12.18 million units, respectively, as of August.

In addition to the glass slab becoming widely accepted as the standard design for a big chunk of smartphones made and sold today, the fast lane launches and the constant battle to uproot competition have led manufacturers to focus on other areas than design.

It won’t be long until we can share our full initial impressions, but we can talk a bit about the new camera setup, and it’s certainly shaping up to be impressive. That’s not particularly surprising. I highly rate the Find X8 Pro — my current daily driver — in no small part for its stunning pictures. But OPPO plans to take things up a gear this year with a new 200-megapixel telephoto camera, co-developed with Hasselblad once again. The company also has a Hasselblad telephoto extender lens that takes the 200MP camera’s 3.3x zoom / 70mm focal length and blasts it up to a longer-range 9.6x zoom with an equivalent 230mm focal length. Paired with crops and upscaling from that huge 200MP camera, it can take photos all the way out to 40x (920mm).",

In most cases, you’ll get a higher offer with postpaid trade-ins, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still get a good trade-in offer as a prepaid customer. Let’s take a quick look at the biggest differences between prepaid and postpaid trade-ins and what to look for if you are interested in prepaid service but want a good trade-in offer. You can get a decent trade-in value, but condition matters much more with prepaid",

According to the report, there will not be a Galaxy S26 Edge. Instead, Samsung will stick to its tried-and-tested lineup of Galaxy S26 (Pro), S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. A previous report had suggested that Samsung has already resumed development on the Galaxy S26 Plus. Samsung took a giant leap of faith with the Galaxy S25 Edge , a flagship smartphone that was ready to compromise on some core specifications in the pursuit of a thin and light body. The Korean company one-upped Apple before it could launch the iPhone Air , and even several other Android OEMs before they could jump onto the thin-and-light bandwagon. However, it’s no surprise that the Galaxy S25 Edge isn’t selling well, and the latest report out of South Korea indicates that Samsung has already canceled its successor, the Galaxy S26 Edge.

It packs a 5,000mAh battery, a triple-rear camera setup, 16GB of RAM, and a MediaTek chipset. There’s a lot of talk about de-Googling these days. The movement essentially advocates cutting Google’s access to private information on people’s devices. That’s why many privacy-focused operating systems, like GrapheneOS , are gaining traction among users who want to avoid Google’s tracking and data collection and protect their information from reaching the wrong hands. Now, a new smartphone called the HIROH Phone is promising all those things, and it even adds a hardware kill switch for extra peace of mind.",

The company has updated its product FAQs to note that while its Colorsoft screens deliver a “high-quality reading and writing experience,” the black-and-white Kindles, such as the Paperwhite and Scribe, still offer slightly crisper text. As spotted by Good e-Reader , Amazon added near-identical wording to the FAQ pages for both the new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and the cheaper 16GB Colorsoft model . The company explains that the color layer responsible for bringing illustrations to life also changes the screen’s texture and brightness. If you’re after the sharpest black-and-white reading experience, Amazon suggests checking out its monochrome Kindles instead.",

Live Updates allow apps to provide persistent progress updates in the status bar, on the always-on display, and at the top of the notification panel. The feature wasn’t fully ready in Android 16’s initial release, which is why the Easter egg is only now being updated to support it. One of the biggest new features in Android 16 is Live Updates. Live Updates are basically Android’s version of iOS’ Live Activities, and they allow you to quickly get progress updates from applications without stopping whatever you’re doing. For example, a navigation app could use Live Updates to show your next turn in a status bar chip, or a food delivery app could use it to tell you that your food is about to be dropped off. There’s a lot of potential ways that apps can use the Live Updates feature, but unfortunately, developers had to wait a bit to actually use it. That’s because the Live Updates feature wasn’t ready until last month’s Android 16 QPR1 release , which added full support for it. The initial release of Android 16, in contrast, just added support for the new progress-cent…",

Google’s hoping its big Gemini for Home upgrade and new hardware will turn things around, but after so many false starts, we wanted to know if people are willing to wait around for that revival. We polled our readers to find out. My colleague Karandeep Singh expressed his personal views on this recently, making his article the perfect place to run our poll. For his part, he admitted his loyalty to Google Home had finally run out. He explained how years of reliability issues and patchy updates had worn him down, and how learning that Gemini for Home won’t launch in India anytime soon was the final straw.

The new Single Wireless Charger and Car Wireless Charger are both Qi2-certified and designed to work with Samsung’s latest flagships, provided you use a compatible magnetic case for the whole Qi2 experience.

JOD is a lease plan that allowed subscribers to swap their leased devices out as frequently as once a month — an appealing proposition for folks who want to try out all the latest phones without spending thousands of dollars a year to do it. T-Mobile has announced that that plan is going away in a few weeks, but it’s offering subscribers a pretty decent consolation. As spotted by The Mobile Report , T-Mobile is ending the JOD program on December 1. But as T-Mobile spells out in support documentation, existing JOD subscribers will get to keep their current device when the plan goes away.

At only 5.99mm thick and weighing about 159g, it blends style with substance, packing a 4,800mAh battery, Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, and triple 50MP cameras into a chassis thinner than most flagships.

The iPhone 17 series has been well-received by customers, and it’s even enough to tempt many Android users into making the switch . Apple has made some meaningful upgrades to the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras, but Android flagships, especially those from Chinese OEMs, show us that there is still room for significant improvement.

The Play Store returns a “Can’t connect” error despite the device having a working internet connection. Clearing the Play Store’s app data seems to resolve the issue for most affected users. Android TV 14 is over a year old, but this platform update has barely rolled out to the sea of Android TV devices . Still, most consumers have learned to live with their Android TVs as long as the TV can still open their favorite streaming apps, and let them download the occasional new app. However, this also appears to have hit a roadblock, as some users are complaining that they can no longer open the Play Store on their Android TV and Google TV devices.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed.

Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet.
