Based on the name, you might think this is just a basic refresh with maybe a smaller size or a new minor feature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Plus model does everything the original TWO did, yes, but brings in a new capability that makes it pretty much indispensable for anyone: Apple CarPlay support. Finally, multi-OS families won’t need two different dongles or need to fight over whether Android or iOS gets preferential treatment in the car. Now, everyone can live in harmony.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole. However, it seems T-Mobile has caught on, and the free ride is now coming to an end for them. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

While Atlas is available on Mac, OpenAI is working to bring it to other platforms, though not anytime soon. The overbearing success of agentic browsers, such as Comet and Dia, recently inspired another AI pioneer to take a plunge into the arena with its own browser. Yes, I’m referring to OpenAI’s recent launch of the Atlas browser , which already makes Chrome seem archaic in comparison. But it’s still lacking some key features, like multiple profiles and tab groups, which OpenAI is now working to fix.

The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Users can fix the issue by rolling back to an older version (9.9.106.773153235.19) of the app or by using sandboxed Play Services on GrapheneOS. Earlier today, we reported that the latest Pixel Camera update (version 10.x) was crashing on de-Googled operating systems like GrapheneOS . The issue stems from a newly introduced dependency, with the app now requiring Google Play Services to function. Without Google Play Services, it simply crashes or refuses to fire up.

Indiegogo is one of the most popular crowdfunding platforms, hosting everything from Android gaming handhelds to creepy AI pets . However, a recent change has significantly impacted the public image of the platform, affecting both buyers and creators. Earlier this year, Indiegogo was purchased by the board game crowdfunding platform Gamefound. At the time, it was announced that the two would remain independent but have new integrations. For example, login credentials would be shared across both sites, and Indiegogo would soon switch to Gamefound’s “proven technology” on its website.",

For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical. There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.",

Phone makers do improve graphics performance through periodic updates, but major GPU updates can be rare. Google has confirmed that the Pixel 10 will receive GPU driver updates in the future. In response to Android Authority’s query about potential driver updates for the Pixel 10 ‘s Imagination GPU, a Google spokesperson said:",

    "summary": "It's $1,800 for the headset, but the accessories add another $500. What's your view on the price?",
    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

Scrolling can be resumed at any time, and Shorts will still appear throughout the app while the main feed is paused. This timer is rolling out beginning today, but you may not have it just yet. Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",

    "body": "A few months ago, I couldn’t really imagine ditching Chrome. I had been using the browser for over a decade, and I had become reliant on many of its features. However, at the same time, I was growing dissatisfied with the experience, especially after Google’s switch to Manifest V3 . The lack of extensions and certain native features on the mobile app also pushed me further, and I finally started making the transition. I can now say that I don’t use Chrome on any of my devices. Here’s how I made the switch easier.",

    "body": "Credit: Reddit user DakAttack316 TL;DR The popular Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max is reportedly changing to a rose gold or pink hue for a small percentage of users. Several users report that their phones have changed from orange to a rose gold hue, possibly due to solvent use or UV exposure. Apple has quietly replaced affected units. Official response is still pending. The iPhone 17 series is one of Apple’s most successful releases in recent times. Despite the phones being available for over a month now, many models are still routinely out of stock, indicating continued strong demand. Case in point, the new Cosmic Orange color on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max still has a shipping wait time of one to three weeks, depending on the storage variant. The saturated orange color is catching the fancy of many users, but if you have one or are considering buying, you should be aware of the possibility that it may turn rose gold, potentially by accident.
