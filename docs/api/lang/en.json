    "body": "Credit: Mitja Rutnik / Android Authority Robinhood is loved by many, but the app has received its fair share of criticism over the years. Some have accused the company of using game-like features within the app that may result in risky trading behavior. It’s not the only broker that does this, though. Gamifying the investment process makes it look less daunting and more fun, which is a great way to attract new customers. Robinhood also came under public scrutiny years ago when it imposed trading restrictions during the meme stock frenzy, a move that many of its clients took to heart.",

The update is based on Google’s latest Wear OS 6 platform. Samsung is also testing a beta for the Galaxy Watch 6 and is expected to also release the update for the Watch 5 and Watch 4. Earlier this week, Galaxy Watch 7 joined the list of watches running Google’s latest Wear OS 6 interface. It arrived with the stable One UI 8 Watch update, which, until yesterday, was limited to beta testers in Korea. Shortly after, however, Samsung also made the update available to a select set of users in the US, signalling the beginning of a broader release in the region. Two simultaneous reports indicate that the One UI 8 Watch update for the Galaxy Watch 7 is now live in the US. The first comes from Reddit user akaGustavo , who received the update on their 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 with LTE. A few others replied to the same thread, confirming the release. Meanwhile, Verizon has also officially confirmed the release for both the 40mm and 44mm variants of the Galaxy Watch 7.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google broke the Pixel IMS app that enabled VoLTE/VoWiFi on unsupported carriers, but the developer has already released a new workaround. Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

T-Mobile is no stranger to increasing pricing, with some legacy plans getting a price hike earlier in the year.

The issue seems to be affecting the Pro Pixel 10 models more than others. Some users found a temporary workaround involving Google Play Services, but it may be a risky maneuver. Google rolled out the October Pixel update just last week, but it’s not going down smoothly for Pixel 10 owners. Users are reporting random app crashes after installing the update, with multiple threads on Reddit pointing to the Pixel 10 Pro as the most affected model. Since the update is still reaching more devices, it’s possible the issue extends to the standard Pixel 10 as well.",

The console also borrows its design from the classic Nintendo DSi, with colors inspired by the DS and 3DS. The beauty of Android is that it dynamically adapts to various formats and screen sizes almost seamlessly (surprisingly, it took Google so long to realize it would also work well on laptops !). This virtue has allowed Android to drive the resurgence of various ignored or abandoned form factors, such as decade-old Blackberrys . For Nintendo DS and 3DS fans specifically, it has led to the emergence of Android gaming handhelds armed with not one but two screens . After products from noted portable console makers, including AYANEO and AYN , another manufacturer — ANBERNIC — is throwing its hat into the ring with a new dual-screen handheld. And it is much more affordable than any of the existing options. ANBERNIC just dropped a teaser for its upcoming dual-screen handheld, called the “RG DS.” Unlike its bland name, however, the handheld is shown in jazzy colors, including a glossy red, a lustrous blue, a retr…",

This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support.

This will pull up all of the widgets on your phone that fit in the same grid size as the one that’s already there.

AI is impressive, but it’s genuinely not accessible for all — not just for its cost, but also for the grit and constant iteration of prompts to master the result. However, if there’s one product that has reshaped my views, it is NotebookLM, which has truly transformed how I consume information, for reasons other than the fact that it takes excessive prompt engineering out of the question. I have offloaded the unexciting aspects of learning to NotebookLM . That includes boring marketing or business newsletters, research papers, and video essays that I want to imbibe the best of, but without watching the idle chatter that those presenters engage in before getting to the point. You name it, and NotebookLM helps sort it out. And, one NotebookLM feature that particularly does most of the heavy lifting for me is Audio Overview . I’m inclined to believe it is also NotebookLM’s star performer — the feature that gets used the most.",

Turns out, it can also make some unhelpful changes to your Echo Show’s home screen. In a post on the Amazon Echo subreddit, user Setati complains that their Echo Show 5 has recently become less fit for one of their primary use cases: telling the time. Setati writes that “about the same time as Alexa+,” their Show 5 started showing content that it didn’t before, replacing the full-screen clock with “news briefs and things it thinks I want to see.”",

This year, the Galaxy S26 Pro and S26 Plus are reported to arrive with Exynos 2600, while the Edge and Ultra will have Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Despite this, phones in the US and in China will continue to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all models. If there’s something Samsung should be praised for, it is its grit and relentlessness. The company has experienced various setbacks but has recovered from them just as quickly. And it may now be working to remove another thorn by addressing longstanding issues with its Exynos lineup. The rumored Exynos 2600 is expected to be Samsung’s first chipset based on a 2nm process, and the company has already begun mass-producing it. While earlier reports speculated on the possibility of the chipset being used for one of the Galaxy S26 phones in certain regions, a recent report claims the strategy may already have been finalized. Following last month’s news establishing the likelihood of Samsung’s Exynos 2600 to be used inside the Galaxy S26 Pro — the smallest and most affordable of the lot , SamM…",

The Edge Panel was initially rolled out on Samsung’s early Edge smartphones, which ran the much-maligned TouchWiz user interface.

LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
