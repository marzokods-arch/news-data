Via the Game Workers' Branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), 93 staff and ex-staff allege \"systemic mistreatment, mismanagement, and mishandling of the redundancy process\" by studio bosses Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies.

Its failure was followed by layoffs at the studio, which the IWGB now says hit over 250 devs at the (formerly) 500-dev studio. BARB's handling of that process is a key point of contention here. At the same time as publishing the open letter, the IWGB announced that it is filing legal charges against BARB for mishandled redundancies. \"Employees have received misinformation, been handed dismissal notices with the wrong notice periods, and been put in the wrong teams so that their performances were scored by the wrong people\", reads …",

I've had a chance to perform some early testing of Battlefield 6's performance on two of Nvidia's mid-to-upper-mid range GPUs, the RTX 4070 and RTX 5070 Ti , and I've got even better news for you—not only does the game look great, but it seems mercifully light on modern graphics cards at everything but the very top setting. Which is appropriately named \"Overkill\". Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. Jumping into the Battlefield 6 graphics settings screen reveals two preset menus for Performance and Graphics Quality, both of which default to Auto. The first switches between Balanced, Performance and Custom settings, while the second allows individual pre…",

    "body": "With Sony's PlayStation 6 now only a few years away (according to Sony), we have just received a whole new batch of information on the tech AMD is working on, and it makes me excited for what it will do for PC gamers. Shared to the official PlayStation YouTube account , AMD's senior vice president and general manager, Jack Huynh, had a brief conversation with Mark Cerny, the lead system architect for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. They talk about future tech for PlayStation and the advancements AMD is making with its RDNA architecture to support that. AMD has been a long-time collaborator with Sony, with the PS4 using an AMD Jaguar CPU, and the PS5 housing an 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU. Intel was reportedly in the running to develop the PS6's APU, but disputes over profit margins allegedly pushed them out of the competition . Both the PS5 and PS5 Pro are built on RDNA 2 architecture, with the latter landing \" somewhere between RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. \" There are three central updates shared in this presentation. The first is Neural Arrays . As Mark Cerny puts it, this collection of compute units (the compute blocks in an AMD GPU) pushed together to work as a single AI engine will \"allo…",

    "body": "The US government has had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with, well, most of the world around the export of chips, thanks to the exponential growth of AI and the uncertainty of tariffs. Large datacentres need technology to keep growing, and America clearly wants to sit at the top of the AI pile. The United Arab Emirates may just sit on that pile alongside it, according to recent agreements. As reported by Bloomberg , the US and the United Arab Emirates have reached an accord for the UAE to start taking in Nvidia processors for AI development. The Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security reportedly issued a license to Nvidia to export chips, but the specific number of processors has not yet been announced. The US was previously in talks to approve up to 100,000 chips a year to the UAE, but that number jumped up to 500,000 a year until 2027, after talks. The current figure of exported chips under the new license has not been disclosed. The original agreement earlier this year suggested that, of the 500,000 export figure, a fifth would be going to G42, a large AI company based in Abu Dhabi, with much of the rest going to American operations (like datacenters) in the re…",

You play a noble god of the forest protecting trees from old-timey woodcutters and hunters who have come to cut down Old Man Willow and shoot all the wildlife. Fortunately, you can build an army of mythical creatures including satyrs and half-naked giants who rend and stomp loggers with abandon. Maybe you are a bit villain-adjacent. The demo I played at PAX Australia gave me a home tree and a single hut to protect, but let me grow more trees each night to produce the resources I needed to summon defenders. Willows are expensive and finicky about being planted near water, while the spruce don't give a damn where they grow, but produce less of the magic juice I need to cast spells and summon goblins and vodyanoy. Once I'm done with a night's planting and summoning I press the button to begin the day, and waves of humans with axes and bows start marching in. As well as just selecting a blob of monsters and right-clicking on them, I have access to a handful of spells. Meteors crush enemies, runes heal my guys, and kelpies…",

But it is the 15th anniversary of developer MachineGames, and that's a pretty big deal in its own right. So, to the update : The New Game+ mode will unlock once you've completed the game, enabling you to replay the entire adventure with all your collected and unlocked Adventure Books, as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and medicine bottles from your previous playthrough. You will of course be a lot more powerful all kitted out like that, so MachineGames suggests increasing the difficulty for the NG+ playthrough, but you do you—as long as Nazis are getting socked in the chops, all is well. As a reward for your efforts, completing the Great Circle in NG+ will unlock an all-new ending sequence that rolls after the credits.

The good news amidst the bad is that a demo for HOMM: Olden Era is now available on Steam , offering players access to the game's tutorial and three different singleplayer modes, using four \"very different factions\" of the six planned for the early access release.

During my many hours putting Battlefield 6 through its paces in early access, I had the chance to face off against and team up with content creators and other journalists. That's cool and all, but some of the most fun I had was against Battlefield 6's bots. Not because they're incredibly easy to farm for kills (though that's also true), but because they're so…interesting. It's hard to truly grasp just how dumb BF6's AI-controlled bots really are, and that's a shame because you're unlikely to ever witness it for yourself outside of the campaign. These bots only ever joined in on the action whenever the server couldn't be fully populated by real players. During a limited review period, that's an inevitability.

Paradox and Colossal Order announced today that the big, twice-delayed DLC will finally go live on October 29. Bridges and Ports was originally expected to launch in mid-2024, a few months after the release of the Beach Properties asset pack earlier that year. But Beach Properties was such a mess that Paradox eventually apologized for the whole thing and just gave it to everyone for free, and ultimately delayed the expansion into the second quarter of 2025 so it could focus on the main game, which was also a mess. Then it delayed Bridges and Ports again, to near the end of 2025 , because everything was a mess. But apparently now that's all been sorted, at least enough that the expansion can be unleashed on the public. The Bridges and Ports expansion will add 20 new drawbridges and lift bridges, customizable ports, a new Ferry Transport System, \"expanded maritime industries\"—fishing, offshore oil rigs, that sort of thing—and three new maps, more than 100 assets, and new achievements.

Think of getaways as an extra layer of customization that merges travel and generic lots, but instead of trusting your sims to roam free, you can give them a to-do list that they'll (usually) follow. Your sims can fill roles you design and specify, or the game can supplement gaps with random assignments. I like using it to send child sims off to camp for a weekend while knowing they'll come home better for it, or for keeping bigger households busy and on-task so I can focus elsewhere.

But regional pricing on Steam supports an awful lot of other currencies, allowing for local costs that are, ideally, better for consumers in other parts of the world than converting to US dollars. In reality, though, the system works out better for some gamers than others: Some regional prices end up being cheaper than a converted price, but others can be significantly more expensive. The price of Battlefield 6 in Chinese yuan, for instance, is ¥268 according to SteamDB , which works out to a little under $38, quite a discount on its $70 price in the US; at the other end of the scale, though, are gamers in Israel, who are going to have to fork over 299 new shekels, which converts to nearly $92.

Mass production has apparently begun, and 400,000–600,000 units are expected per year. Deckard, for those unaware, is Valve's long-, long-, long -anticipated VR headset that's expected to be a standalone device not requiring PC power, unlike the Valve Index . We first caught wind of it back in June 2022, thanks to a December 2021 patent application . Since then, we've had rumour after rumour, including that 'Roy' controllers for Deckard were being tooled last year, that Valve was importing VR manufacturing equipment into the US earlier this year , and that some influencers recently travelled to Seattle and were a little cryptic about it. It's one of those things that has been on the cards for such a long time that it has somehow seemed to be imminently approaching, and yet also a little like a fable we'll never see the real sight of.

Series vets are gobbling up this sequel as if we haven't eaten for weeks while patting DICE and its Battlefield Studios cohorts on the back for managing to execute a normal Battlefield game. DICE's last effort tanked expectations, but that's not why Battlefield 6 is impressive. It's the wider multiplayer culture of 2025—wrung out by years of battle royale banality and meta-pilled ranked modes—that created the conditions for an ordinary Battlefield to be the most exciting FPS of the year. Place your palm on the pavement, and you can feel the low rumble of a hobby yearning for the return of what we loved 15 years ago: the spectacle of scale , the unserious chaos of vehicular warfare, red grunts vs. blue grunts, the permission to make your own rules , and an environment where the guy obsessed with metas is having the least fun.

Not to me, it's not. Judging from the video demonstration above, the real magic occurs in the last stage of the pipeline, where the neural model cleans up the speech even better than the Wiener filter does (no sniggering, that's a serious scientific term ). Apparently this method of snooping can be performed on \"consumer-grade mice with high-fidelity sensors\", which sounds a lot like \"gaming mouse\" to me. That does seem to be exactly the case, as in the full paper (pdf warning) we can see the researchers used a Razer Viper at 8 kHz polling to train the models used for this attack.

While you'll unlock the ability to redeem codes almost immediately, you'll have to progress a teensy bit further until you do the Thunder Demon Smackdown (essentially combat training) in the Seabreeze Festival to unlock the gacha.

For example, one LNL chip can be found in nine different Core Ultra 200V CPUs.

    "body": "At this year's Technology Tour event in Arizona, Intel not only launched its Panther Lake CPU architecture but it also announced an update to its AI-powered performance scaling package, and it now brings XeSS on par with Nvidia's DLSS, as Arc GPU users will soon get the benefit of multi-frame generation. Exactly how soon is yet to be confirmed, and it's not clear whether XeSS 3 will have any other notable additions or improvements. However, XeSS-MFG is definitely coming, and in games that already support XeSS-FG , you'll be able to enable 3x or 4x frame generation. This can be either in the game itself or via Intel's Graphics Software application. As it so happens, Intel has sneakily been hinting at multi-frame generation for several months, but it's only very recently that this was noticed. Hidden away in a config file was a single line titled 'Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)', but I just assumed that it was either a fairly generic label or that Intel wouldn't have anything to show for a good while. How wrong I was on both counts. So just what exactly is XeSS-MFG? Well, Intel's frame generation system works very much like Nvidia's does. The GPU renders a frame as normal and then st…",

    "body": "Battlefield 6 is just one day from launch and we've had a final spattering of updated system requirements. To be more specific, we've been told what the system requirements are to have an 'Ultra++' gameplay experience and, while these requirements are no joke, EA isn't saying these will net you a mere 60 fps at 4K. No, if you have the system components required for Ultra++ gameplay, this should apparently net you 144 fps on High settings at 4K with DLSS upscaling turned on, or 240+ fps on Ultra settings at 4K with DLSS Multi Frame Generation (MFG) turned on. Achieving these frame rates at these settings will require an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor. It's interesting to note, that a Core Ultra 9 285K should achieve what the Ryzen 7 9800X3D can here, given the latter is much better for gaming. But I suppose at 4K on high and ultra settings, the CPU won't play anywhere near as large a part as the GPU. The way EA has laid out the requirements might be a little confusing, but the general gist is actually incredibly positive: Not much is really required at all to get the game running well.

Well, Google Japan's latest bit of whimsical concept kit seeks to reinvigorate the rotary wheel. The Gboard Dial Version is a keyboard that eschews clicky-clacky keys for the burbling whir of nine rotary mechanisms instead (via The Verge ). For those unfamiliar with how this is supposed to work, rather than depressing a key, you jam your finger in the hole above the corresponding character you wish to type, drag the rotary wheel around as far as you can, and then release. There you go, you've 'typed' a single alphanumeric character—now on to the next one. It's a decidedly drawn-out process that would stop my hot takes long before they threaten to boil over, that's for sure. Oh, did I mention this concept keyboard comes with a stand that looks like an old-timey cradle for a landline phone? You can switch off your camera in video calls when you rest your mouse atop this cradle. That's not quite as dramatic as slamming the receiver down to end the call, but I can appreciate …",

Recently, I had the luxury of reviewing Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 RTX 5060 gaming notebook, and to be honest, it left quite an impression. Although not perfect in every aspect, its performance is outstanding, and when paired with a crisp 15.6-inch IPS panel, it thankfully delivers an exceptional gaming experience no matter what I chuck at it. Even in spite of its weird and not-wonderful SSD and RAM combo. When the Gigabyte Gaming A16 landed on my desk not long after, complete with that same RTX 5060 and a similar 1920 x 1200 IPS display, I was hopeful that perhaps the foibles Lenovo had introduced in its own model could be remedied by a brand with a bit more sensibility. A bit more gaming panache, let's say. And that's the key thing here. The Gigabyte A16 and the Lenovo Gen10 are both priced at around $1,300 or thereabouts (there's some confusion on the British front, but I'll talk about that in a bit). Both feature damn near close enough the same form factor, and both are targeting the same budget-centric audience as well, and come with remarkably similar hardware underneath. On…",
