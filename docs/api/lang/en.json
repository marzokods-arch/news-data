Rosalía shared the trip with her millions of followers on TikTok Live, showing her and her friends riding in a limousine through the streets of Mexico’s capital before arriving at a branch of a famous pozole restaurant chain. There, she tasted the popular dish for the first time — a broth made with corn kernels, chicken or pork, chili and topped with lettuce.
