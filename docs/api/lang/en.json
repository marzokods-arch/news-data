    "body": "When Marshall Betts and Avery McTaggart first began sketching ideas for what would become TBA Agency, live music had all but vanished. The touring world was at a standstill, and hundreds of agents—including the pair and their future partners—had just been laid off from the now-shuttered Paradigm Talent Agency in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. What began as a few late-night phone calls between friends became a bold bet on the future of live music at a time when there was no live music at all. Both Betts and McTaggart had followed parallel paths through the agency world. After early stints at The Windish Agency, they joined Paradigm when Windish was acquired, helping to expand the company into one of the dominant forces in touring. “Paradigm was acquiring half a dozen agents every quarter,” Betts recalled. “It was rapid expansion—and then, in March 2020, everything stopped.” The demands of social distancing and stay-at-home notices paused the live music world for more than a year. Within weeks, entire departments at agencies like Paradigm were laid off or suspended. “No one even knew what the next week would look like,” he said. Related How Shakira Outdid Herself W…",

The option works alongside the Touch &amp; hold option that also lets you select symbols, but by long-pressing a key. Google has been testing various ways to make typing on Android devices feel as effortless as possible. In addition to making voice typing much more efficient , Google has been experimenting with several Gboard tweaks, such as auto-switching to the English alphabet after you enter a symbol or punctuation mark. Besides those tests, the tech giant has also been rolling out new features, such as the recent addition that lets you enter symbols with far more ease. A new “Flick keys to enter symbols” mode is now rolling out to Gboard with version 16.2. The feature was spotted rolling out to the beta channel last month, and is now also available on the stable channel, as highlighted by 9to5Google .",

Researchers at cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric have identified a new Android banking trojan, dubbed Herodotus , that takes deception a step further by mimicking human behavior during remote-control sessions to avoid detection. The malware can intercept SMS messages to capture 2FA codes, deploy overlay pages to steal login credentials, and abuse accessibility services to log on-screen activity.

The camera hardware has been downgraded, featuring smaller sensors and slower apertures compared to the OnePlus 13. Other key changes include improved stereo speakers, fewer microphones (three vs four), and an upgraded vapor chamber for cooling. OnePlus launched the OnePlus 15 in China this week, positioning itself as a contender for the best next-gen Android flagship . We expect to see the OnePlus 15 make its way to global markets soon, so if you haven’t already bought a OnePlus flagship, you shouldn’t buy one until the new flagship launches. If you’re curious what parts make the OnePlus 15 tick, we now have a better look at the internals, thanks to teardowns. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

While fans are pleased with the pricing and the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the physical design of the handheld has been met with widespread disapproval in the community. The new row of buttons beneath the screen, which gives it a more retro look, reduces the overall screen-to-body ratio, and some feel that it’s a step backwards.",

    "body": "TL;DR Android 16 introduces “seamless app updates” to make installing app updates faster and less disruptive. This feature significantly reduces the time an app is frozen during an update, cutting it from seconds to milliseconds. The improvement is achieved by running optimization scripts earlier in the installation process, reducing app downtime. When you update an Android app , the operating system freezes it to prevent it from running. This is an important step, as an app could experience issues if it tried to access code and resources that are in the process of changing. While most updates install almost instantly, some can take several seconds. This not only makes the app being updated temporarily unusable but can also affect other apps that depend on it. To improve this experience, Google has quietly introduced a change in Android 16 to make app updates faster and less disruptive. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google moves away from the previous “eerie black,” which is a very dark shade of gray with hints of blue. The change is already live in the latest version of Google’s Android app. Android has offered a native dark theme since Android 10. Over these last six-plus years, the implementation has both matured significantly, and an aspect that most dark theme enthusiasts, including me, have come to cherish is the use of a true black background instead of a gray one. True black is pleasant to the eye and is believed to be slightly better at conserving your phone’s battery — at least with AMOLEDs. And while many manufacturers, such as OnePlus and Samsung, have adopted it for their menus and apps, Google still appears to have a soft heart for dark gray backgrounds — yes, it defends using a dark gray over black. But if you despise the use of gray over an actual black, you’ll be relieved to know that at least one Google app is moving towards a black aesthetic. The Gemini interface for Android is now moving from dark gray to a truly black back…",

For week seven’s Halloween Night, the Australian conservationist and his dancing partner Witney Carson performed a Tango to “Sweet Dreams are Made of This” by The Hampton String Quartet. In the clip, which can be seen in full below, Irwin, dressed-up like the Prince of Darkness, tangles with Carson on a fog-filled stage before taking the action to the main floor. Staying in theme to the bitter end, Irwin collects himself from the hardwood and is dragged to hell (or backstage) by dark forces, returning to face the judges with his face splattered in fake blood. The judges loved it, as Irwin and Carson collected 38 out of a possible 40 points, their best result yet in the competition which included two perfect 10s. It wasn’t enough, however, to take top spot on the night, as the pair was pipped by Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy with 39/40 . Irwin, the son of the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin, has a fine chance of emulating the success of his older sister Bindi, who won the 21 st &nbsp;season of&nbsp; DWTS , in 2015.

The new feature will eliminate the need to reopen previously used music or audio apps when switching. This multi-card interface would streamline use for people who frequently toggle between different audio sources. Android Auto is currently in a good state of utility, but that’s no reason to slack off. Google has been working on several new features for the platform, including the recently announced Call screening and Call Notes functionality , as well as the upcoming home screen widgets . There’s more on the way, too. With Android Auto v15.6.154404 beta, we’ve identified code that suggests Android Auto may soon make it easier to switch between different music apps.

A T-Mobile card has been rumored for months, with reports in April suggesting a Capital One–backed Visa was in development. This update comes days after T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole that allowed credit card users to retain their discount. When T-Mobile closed an AutoPay loophole last week that let people keep their $5-per-line discount while paying early with a credit card, we speculated that this might be in preparation for the long-rumored T-Mobile credit card to become an eligible payment method when it launches. Indeed, it would be the only credit card you could use while still keeping the savings. That wasn’t the most groundbreaking of predictions, but there’s now strong evidence it could become a reality very soon. A Reddit user just spotted new text in T-Mobile’s app referring to a “T-Mobile Visa® credit card” as one of the payment options for AutoPay, alongside bank accounts and debit cards. Other credit cards, plus Apple Pay and Google Pay, are listed as ineligible. The T-Mobile Visa text is also a clickable hyperlink, though…",

Google denied the reports of a Gmail security event, claiming that people misunderstood the compilation of breached login credentials. The company recommends users enable two-factor authentication and use passkeys to keep their accounts secure. Infostealer databases help consumers get a grasp on whether their personal data and account information has been leaked in a data breach. However, they can occasionally steer users in the wrong direction. Multiple news outlets reported this week that a massive Gmail leak exposed over 183 million passwords, but Google is now publicly refuting those claims. “Reports of a ‘Gmail security breach impacting millions of users’ are false,” Google explained in a thread on X (via Engadget ). “Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.”",

One summary said “Michael was seen taking out the trash,” while another labeled a man living alone as “Sarah.” Google provided a statement explaining that it is actively investing to improve the accuracy of facial identification. Update: October 28, 2025 (2:15 PM ET): In response to our original article below, a Google spokesperson reached out to us with the following statement: Gemini for Home (including AI descriptions, Home Brief, and Ask Home) is in early access so users can try these new features and continue giving us feedback as we work to perfect the experience. As part of this, we are investing heavily in improving accurate identification. This includes incorporating user-provided corrections to generate more accurate AI descriptions. Since all Gemini for Home features rely on our underlying Familiar Faces identification, improving this accuracy also means improving the quality of Familiar Faces. This is an active area of investment and we expect these features to keep improving over time.",

It was less than two weeks ago that we learned the Fairphone 4 would skip Android 14 altogether with a jump straight to Android 15 , and things are moving quickly. Rewarding owners for their patience after last year’s software delay, the company previously stated that the upgrade would start arriving “from early November onwards.” Fairphone seems to be ahead of schedule this time around, with Android 15 already rolling out on the device. A Fairphone employee confirmed on the company’s Community Forum that the phased rollout would begin on October 27, and the update is now reaching some users. It includes the October security patch and weighs in at around 1.6GB, depending on your existing version. The rollout is still phased, so those who haven’t received it yet should expect a notification in the coming days and weeks.",

Instead of flooding the market with free-phone offers that require no trade-in, AT&amp;T focuses on consistent discounts that usually extend to both new and existing customers. That makes the deals less flashy, but often more fair. There are a few catches, of course. Many upgrade offers require you to be on one of AT&amp;T’s pricier unlimited plans as an existing customer, while new customers may qualify with even the entry-level unlimited tier. And while most of the biggest savings come from trade-ins, AT&amp;T is generally flexible here as older or damaged phones often still qualify for credits that can knock $1,000 or more off the price of a new device. A handful of promotions even skip the trade-in requirement entirely, bringing prices close to free.",

Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR A new leak claims that the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 SoC by Qualcomm will utilize TSMC’s advanced N2P chip process for improved performance and efficiency. It is expected to support LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage, offering significant enhancements over the current 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC. However, continued increases in manufacturing costs may make next-gen flagship phones with this future chip notably pricier. Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the SoC of choice for many next-generation Android flagships . It’s the latest and greatest chip on the block, announced just a few weeks ago. The cycle for new phones has just gotten started with this new SoC, but we’re already seeing leaks appear for its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6.

A few recent Kindle updates have genuinely earned my applause. Amazon gave us finer text controls with adjustable line and paragraph spacing that make reading feel less claustrophobic. Likewise, accessibility tweaks improved navigation for visually impaired users. A recent Kindle Scribe update delivered new pen tools and a sleeker sidebar for note-taking.",

To fix the issue, users on GrapheneOS build v2025102300 and older can install the GmsCompatLib app v100 from the GrapheneOS store. A future GrapheneOS build (v2025102600) will include the Pixel Camera app fix natively, eliminating the need for extra installation. Last week, the Pixel Camera app began crashing on de-Googled aftermarket OS solutions, such as GrapheneOS. If users didn’t have Google Play Services on their device, the Pixel Camera app would either crash or refuse to start. As it turns out, the actual issue was a missing font .

    "body": "TL;DR Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset has a hidden USB-C port under a cap on the right strap. The USB-C port works independently of the proprietary battery connector, so Galaxy XR can charge and use wired accessories simultaneously. Compared to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest headsets, Galaxy XR figures to handle wired accessories better thanks to the dedicated port. Samsung is helping to usher in the Android XR platform with its first headset, known as Galaxy XR. It appears to take design cues from competitors like Apple and Meta, but has clear advantages of its own. Aside from supporting the full Google Play Store app ecosystem , Samsung’s Galaxy XR has another trick up its sleeve: a hidden, fully-featured USB-C port. The subtle connector is covered most of the time, but after removing the cap on the headset’s right strap, users will find a USB-C port on the Galaxy XR, as discovered by UploadVR . Crucially, the USB-C port is separate from the Galaxy XR’s battery connector. The headset’s tethered battery connects with a proprietary pin system, opening up the USB-C port for use with other accessories.",

The updated context menu will centralize buttons for sharing and selecting chats, making them easier to reach. It should also clarify which chats are selected or unselected in a group, which was previously confusing with Material You shading. Phone screens seem to be always getting larger, and that makes one-handed usability of the latest flagships tricky. Many Google apps use hamburger menus near the top of the screen to grant access to key buttons and features. This becomes a problem when you’re trying to wield a modern Android phone with one hand, but Google appears to be simplifying things for at least one of its apps. Google Messages looks to be adding a new context menu that would let users access important features from anywhere in the chat.

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because – it’s a supermoon! Illustrated infographic showing the difference (as seen from Earth) between perigee, when a supermoon appears, and apogee, when a micromoon appears. NASA/JPL-Caltech This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with “perigee,” which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptio…",

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
