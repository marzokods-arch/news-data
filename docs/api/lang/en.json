IKEA UAE shared the product concept on YouTube, which is a miniature phone bed with an NFC chip inside (via MacRumors ). After downloading the IKEA app on iOS or Android, you’ll get a notification every time you place your phone on the bed. The app will secretly track how long your phone rests on the bed, with the goal being seven hours of rest.",

Now, YouTube TV is undergoing similar negotiations with Disney. Google this week announced it is negotiating with Disney to keep networks like ESPN and ABC available on YouTube TV.

    "summary": "Android 17 could bring an “EyeDropper” tool that helps you determine the colors being used in an image.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google is developing a native color picker tool called “EyeDropper” that is expected to be released with Android 17. This new app will provide a system-wide API, allowing any app to let users select a specific color from their screen and get its value. The tool is designed for both touchscreens and desktop modes, with logic to handle multiple displays when a mouse and keyboard are detected. For professionals who work with images and videos, knowing the exact colors they’re dealing with is critical. Eyeballing it isn’t always enough, as many jobs require precise color reproduction. That’s why hexadecimal codes are often used to represent colors, providing a standard way to accurately replicate them across different software. While most professional apps and web browsers have built-in color pickers that can grab these codes, Android currently lacks this feature. That could change in next year’s Android 17 release, though.

Android Police has rounded up some recent reports from Reddit that say the Pixel 10 , Pixel 9, and Pixel 8 have all had issues contacting emergency services in the US, with calls failing to go through.

YouTube recently introduced a new player UI on the web , with stark changes, especially to the icons. While YouTube calls these new elements “more expressive,” many users can’t resist calling them unsightly and cartoonish . Regardless of the latter group’s views, YouTube is starting to roll out a similar design refresh to its mobile apps. New, thicker, and caricaturish icons can be seen sprinkled across YouTube’s Android and iOS apps, as 9to5Google first noted.",

Based on the name, you might think this is just a basic refresh with maybe a smaller size or a new minor feature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Plus model does everything the original TWO did, yes, but brings in a new capability that makes it pretty much indispensable for anyone: Apple CarPlay support. Finally, multi-OS families won’t need two different dongles or need to fight over whether Android or iOS gets preferential treatment in the car. Now, everyone can live in harmony.",

Going forward, customers who use such methods will lose the $5 per line discount for the next billing cycle. Discount eligibility resets each month, but requires full payment through eligible methods, such as linked bank accounts or debit cards. T-Mobile has some great plans in store for users who want a low phone bill. For existing users, one of the most reliable and consistent ways they can reduce their phone bill is by signing up for AutoPay. AutoPay automatically deducts payments from your linked bank account or debit card to pay your T-Mobile bill, while netting you a discount of $5 per line. Some customers have taken advantage of this AutoPay discount but still opted to pay via a credit card thanks to a loophole.

Gemini struggled with identifying reliable sources, providing quotes, and linking to its source material. While everyone’s tools are showing signs of improvement, Gemini still lags behind. You cannot conduct a conversation about AI without someone quickly bringing up the inconvenient topic of mistakes. For as useful as these systems can be when it comes to organizing information, and as impressive as the content is that generative AI can seemingly pull out of nowhere, we don’t have to look far before we start noticing all the blemishes in this otherwise polished facade. While there’s definitely been progress since the bad old days of Google AI Overviews hallucinating utter nonsense , just how far have things really come? Some new research is taking a rather concerning look into just that. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

The findings were reported by Wired , which reviewed a study shared with it by cybersecurity firm Infoblox and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

The company claims it has stronger coverage and better network consistency, while also highlighting massive infrastructure investments totaling $145 billion. Despite some valid points, the campaign may not be enough to overcome AT&amp;T’s weaker performance in regions where T-Mobile and Verizon dominate. While Verizon and T-Mobile seem engaged in an active and dynamic battle for our cellular souls, AT&amp;T is a bit different. It continues to build out a stable cellular and fiber network and has even managed a few important acquisitions, but it does it in a way that’s much quieter and pretty boring on the surface. Now it seems it’s finally ready to make a little noise, as AT&amp;T has announced a massive new campaign designed to go after T-Mobile for its so-called “Untruths”.

The feature, currently referred to as “Me Meme,” allows users to insert their face into meme templates. It requires a backed-up reference photo, preferably a clear selfie, to work. Google Photos is inarguably one of the best apps that you could have on your Android flagship. What makes Google Photos better is that Google has been constantly and tirelessly working on adding new features to the app, making it useful in the present times. We’ve spotted Nano Banana integration in the works, as well as improvements to the photo-to-video generator . We’ve now spotted Google Photos working on a meme generator, but with a twist: it will use AI to make you the meme.

The new phone will have a 1.5K resolution screen running at 165Hz, compared to the OnePlus 13’s QHD+ 120Hz display. The company says this is because it’s not possible to have a QHD+ screen running at 165Hz. The OnePlus 15 is scheduled to launch in China on Monday, and we know the phone has a 165Hz refresh rate. We previously heard rumors that the device would have a lower-resolution screen, though, and OnePlus has now confirmed this. OnePlus China president Li Jie Louis confirmed in a Weibo article that the OnePlus 15 will have a screen with a 1.5K resolution. That’s a downgrade on paper compared to recent OnePlus flagships, which offered QHD+ screens. However, the executive claimed that this was a technical decision rather than a cost-cutting measure.",

The tablet features a MediaTek Dimensity 8300 chip, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 7,200mAh battery. The company has also developed a game controller made for the Titan 1. While any tablet can run mobile games, it’s different when the device is made specifically for that purpose. From higher refresh rates to hardware that doesn’t overheat, the overall experience can be significantly enhanced when the tech is designed around gaming. On that end, tablet maker Headwolf is launching a new product that aims to be your favorite mobile gaming companion. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "summary": "It's $1,800 for the headset, but the accessories add another $500. What's your view on the price?",
    "body": "TL;DR The launch price of the Galaxy XR is $1,799.99, but adding the controllers and case brings it to around $2,300. That’s still far less than the Apple Vision Pro’s $3,499 launch price, and Samsung’s throwing in freebies worth up to $1,000 for early adopters. But is it fair, overpriced, or good value for a first-gen headset? Cast your vote below. Last night’s Galaxy XR launch finally kicked off Samsung’s long-teased push into Android-powered extended reality. At $1,799.99, it’s not exactly an impulse buy, and what might be harder to swallow for some is that if you want both the controllers and the travel case, you’ll be looking at another $500 on top , bringing the full package to roughly $2,300. The question is, has Samsung got this pricing right? While that’s a lot of money for most people, it’s hard for us to judge whether it’s overpriced, about right, or even good value. This is always the issue with the first generation of a new device category. The obvious comparison to make is with the Apple Vision Pro, which first launched more than 18 months ago and was priced at $3,499. That’s for the base storage model, with the cost rising to $3,899 for the highest storage capacity …",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube has introduced a new timer that automatically pauses scrolling through Shorts. Scrolling can be resumed at any time, and Shorts will still appear throughout the app while the main feed is paused. This timer is rolling out beginning today, but you may not have it just yet. Back in April, we found evidence that YouTube was working on a new feature aimed helping users limit their time watching Shorts videos . Code in a beta version of the YouTube app included mentions of a new timer system that’d stop users from scrolling through the Shorts feed once a predefined timer had expired. Now, that feature is rolling out. TechCrunch spotted this morning that YouTube announced a new daily time limit option for scrolling through Shorts. Once you set up that timer, you’ll get a “dismissable prompt” telling you that Shorts scrolling is paused. Shorts will still appear in other parts of the app, but once you’ve reached your limit, the main Shorts feed will remain disabled until the next day (assuming you don’t just dismiss the timer prompt, anyway).",
