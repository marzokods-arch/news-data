Segway Navimow addresses both of these concerns and more with their latest robot lawn mowers. Navimow showed off five new lineups at CES 2026 – four ideal for residential use, while a new series marks the brand’s first foray into commercial lawn mowing. The i2, H2, X4, and Terranox series address very different yard types, from simple suburban lawns to complex, obstacle-dense landscapes and extreme terrain. And most importantly, they make lawn maintenance a breeze.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google might have begun working on navigation support for Android XR using Google Maps. Previously, Google has previewed how Maps and Gemini could work together to help you navigate, especially while walking. In addition to step-by-step navigation, your Android XR glasses could use feed from their cameras to help you when you’re feeling lost. Google will also give users the option to turn off navigation or alerts if they don’t want to use it. Android XR is Google’s next big ambitious project that it envisages to power dozens of different styles of AR glasses and XR headsets over the next few years. Since the platform is closely related to the mobile version of Android, we’d also see a significant chunk of apps cross-functioning across both platforms. Maps is one of them, and Google has already demonstrated how you can use the app to find places of interest or for an immersive aerial or street view. Now, we’re seeing hints about how Android XR could enhance navigation in Google Maps, especially when you’re walking down the street.

You’ll be able to add AI-generated weather effects to your lock screen wallpaper based on local weather conditions. Effects like rain or snowfall realistically move behind visible objects or people, rather than simply sitting on top of the wallpaper image. Smartphone brands have been paying extra attention to the lock screen lately, treating it as more than just a place to check notifications or check the time. From richer widgets to personalized wallpapers, the smartphone lock screen is becoming more personal, useful, and visually engaging. Samsung’s upcoming One UI 8.5 update looks set to continue that trend with a new weather-driven feature that adds a bit of magic to your wallpaper, and closely mirrors a similar idea Google already offers on Pixel phones.

Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit against five TV manufacturers for “spying on Texans” through the use of automated content recognition (ACR).

This week, Paxton’s office announced a new development: a judge in Texas has issued a temporary restraining order against Samsung, stopping the practice within the state.

Combined with the $.50 hike in April of 2025, fees are up about $1 in less than a year. The vague fee structure continues to draw criticism, though grandfathered plans with taxes and fees included are unaffected. Earlier today, T-Mobile unveiled its new Better Value Plan, promising a better experience for new and existing customers who switch to it. Like every plan offered by T-Mobile these days, this one doesn’t include taxes and fees. That’s become important for T-Mobile, as separate charges mean it is much easier to increase customer spending without officially raising prices by simply increasing said fees. We’ve already seen the company increase its telco fees as recently as last April, but it looks like the company is doing it again. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

For years, robotic pool cleaners have promised convenience, but many still require a fair amount of hands-on effort once the cleaning is done. At CES 2026, Beatbot is using that gap as an opportunity to rethink what modern pool care can look like. One of the global leaders in robotic pool cleaning is unveiling two new products at the show: the flagship Beatbot AquaSense X, designed to push pool automation further than before, and the Beatbot Sora 70 , a model focused on dependable, everyday cleaning. Together, they show two distinct approaches to the same problem, with AquaSense X very clearly leading the charge.",

According to an investor note by Morgan Stanley (spotted via AppleInsider ), Apple will only adopt 200MP cameras on the iPhone 21 series in 2028.

The Google Play Store houses tens of thousands of high-quality games that you can play on your Android flagship . Most games these days are monetized through (often greedy) in-app purchases for cosmetics and gameplay enhancements, but there are rare gems that still offer their entire gaming experience as an upfront, one-time purchase. However, this is both a pro and a con, as users cannot even try out the game before spending money on it.

It’s the type of Android phone that Samsung and Google won’t make, but another company did, and it’s called the Punkt MC03. Punkt may not be a household name, but it’s also not brand new to the smartphone world. The company launched its MC02 phone in February 2024 with the same goal of creating a privacy-focused handset. It wasn’t a complete success, but it was a promising glimpse into Punkt’s vision for Android’s future.",

AI-generated images and videos have quickly proliferated across all online platforms.

It has said that it only delivers software after testing, refuting Google’s plan to split updates into crucial and optional updates. However, it has said that it will resume updates in January 2026. In 2019, Google set out to split Android updates into two parts, so it could deliver crucial features directly to users without needing manufacturers to first adapt them to their custom skins. These updates, now known as Google Play system updates, are responsible for key Android features such as Digital Wellbeing, Privacy Dashboard, theft protection, to name a few. That’s where the Pixel-like UI in some Settings menus comes from. And while Google intended to simplify updates by splitting them, it ended up complicating it for users . That’s because Google Play system updates, which are different from the Google Play Services app you see in the Play Store, don’t always download automatically and often need to be triggered manually from a separate menu, distinct from the usual System Updates section. It’s alright if you never bothered to check these…",

The RockMow X1 and X1 LiDAR offer upgrades to last year’s model with better off-roading capabilities and improved laser vision on the latter. The RockNeo serves as the more general-purpose model with some of the best features of the X1 series. At CES 2026, Roborock revealed a significant breakthrough with its Saros Rover robot vacuum , giving it arms so it can easily go up or down stairs. But while doing so, it hasn’t forgotten your lawn and is introducing enhancements that allow its robot mowers to move more freely. After announcing its first set of robot lawn mowers at IFA last year, Roborock is here with a new lineup for 2026. That includes the RockMow X1, the X1 LiDAR, and RockNeo Q1.",
