After a wobbly start in 2015, the cooperative dungeon crawler has grown steadily in popularity over its lifespan, and in the last 12 months has received more players than ever. Not resting on its laurels, developer Turning Wheel has fed this success back into the game, resulting in one of its most significant updates ever. Titled Instruments of Destruction, the update is so big it's being delivered in two parts.

I remember looking for a mod to replace that with fuller animations back in the day and learning it would be completely impossible. (Deleting the door-opening animation altogether was on the table though, thanks to the Get On With It mod .) Given the whole process is necessarily artificial, it never struck me how bizarre it looks in the instant before the fade—when the NPC about to vanish lights up like they've just been plugged into the mains. As well as all shadows on them disappearing their hair looks super weird, vanishing from their eyebrows, sideburns, and the nape of the neck as the transparencies suddenly fail. Watching the video by modder wSkeever really makes it impossible to ignore. They light up like Uncle Fester with a lightbulb in his mouth, which is why the No Load Door NPC Fade mod is such a blessing. It's a one-kilobyte download, and immediately joins my list …",

Aliens are attacking present-day Earth and it's up to you to figure out why they're here, what they're made of, and send them packing. Or maybe make friends. Or just profit from the chaos. We'll get to that in a minute. The difference is that this shadow war plays out across a detailed map of Earth and the entire solar system involving Lagrange points, interface orbits, and delta-v calculations for sending rockets to mine asteroids. The physics stuff isn't quite as granular as something like Kerbal Space Program, but it's close. And there are many dozens more celestial bodies when you include all the asteroids, moons, and Kuiper belt objects. It's legitimately jaw-dropping, and terrifying at first.

As Nesmith told Press Box PR in an interview , \"go back and play Morrowind and tell me that’s the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe.\" As gaming hot takes go, I'd put that somewhere between blazing inferno and white dwarf, but he didn't stop there.

Named GTA5 V4EVER , Pluma's project strives to \"update the atmosphere of the entire map\" by stuffing Los Santos with more environmental detail than any game from 2013 probably deserves. Far from a simple reshade or texture swap, this pretty massive undertaking adds 20,000 new world objects—from trees to plants, shrubs, fences, poles, signs, street clutter, roadside scenery and more. Moreover, outdated props such as phone booths have been whipped out entirely; while neighbourhoods have been given a fresh lick of paint or a new coat of grime depending on their economic standing—with Pluma's end game being to craft a world that feels \"alive and renewed, without losing the original spirit.\" The outcome is indeed a re-densified Los Santos and Blaine County, whose main thoroughfares feel refreshed and its peripheries reinvigorated.

I'm not huge on it , but PC Gamer staff writer Morgan Park spoke more positively of it in his impressions —though he did say it's \"ill-timed\" given the larger shift toward more casual, chaotic fun that shooters are taking right now. It seems like Highguard may already be moving in that direction itself, though, as it's now toying with a \"hectic\" alternate format. \"We heard the feedback,\" opens the first patch note from the latest post on Highguard's Steam community blog . The new 5v5 mode was implemented just four days after release on Jan. 30, which is a pretty impressive turnaround time for something added in response to community sentiment. You don't have to scroll very far down on the Steam reviews or on the game's subreddit to see people put off by the 3v3 format, as in this thread from user mexicantacothief. It's easy to see why. The game's raid mode is tense and tactical at the best of times, but it never really feels like a 'raid': giant battering ram aside, it's still just six people fighting over a sword and then a handful of buildings.

Bans make picking and counterpicking more interesting and keep imbalanced characters off the field while players wait for a balance patch—and to my delight, Deadlock has finally got them. Well, sort of. What it's actually added is a “prefer to avoid” toggle you can assign to one hero from the game's roster when queuing for both standard play (which is always ranked) and Street Brawl, the new casual mode analogous to League of Legends's ARAM or Valorant's Spike Rush. You also can't avoid new heroes, which currently just applies to the six characters from Old Gods, New Blood . The patch notes, which you can find on Deadlock’s feedback forum , call this a hero banning system, but there are a few reasons for both why this is different and why it might be necessary for a game in pre-alpha. Most ranked modes in MOBAs have a draft phase—a pre-game lobby where both teams take turns selecting heroes for their team and banning them so that no one can play them in that match.

But the \"pirate queen\" of Morocco is finally receiving her due, at least in videogame form, as one of the playable heroes in Civilization 7 's recent Tides of Power Collection DLC—thanks in part to the digging of one University of Kansas professor. \"[Al-Hurra] is fascinating,\" says Finn Taylor, senior narrative designer at Firaxis Games for the 4X strategy title. \"She was highly educated, greatly respected by both friends and foes, and accomplished remarkable feats during a challenging time in Moroccan history.\" Her last name is actually an honorific title, meaning \"free,\" and is given to those who lead—similar to a regional mayor. When Amal El Haimeur, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, ran across her name as an aside in a book, she was immediately curious.

A whole new weapon was recently discovered in the 2006 open-world game, one that's been locked tantalisingly away from players for more than 20 years. Now though, players can get their grubby mitts on it thanks to a glitch discovered by a YouTuber. Said YouTuber is JustGarrison, who, in a zingy twist of irony, stumbled upon the glitch during a pacifist run of Bully. JustGarrison's plan to complete the game without fighting anyone ran smoothly until he encountered Norton, a boss players must defeat during the mission 'The Tenements'. It's here where JustGarrison inadvertently unlocked the weapon—a sledgehammer that was previously only usable during the boss fight. During the boss fight, Norton tries to bash Jimmy's head in with the sledgehammer. But once Norton is defeated, Jimmy can equip the sledgehammer and use it to retrieve some key quest items through the medium of smashing. That's all he can do with it, however. He cannot take it outside. Like Greyfriars Bobby , the weapon is destined to remain by the side of its fallen owner foreve…",

Project: Gorgon is an MMO that harks back to the primordial days of the genre, with simple 3D visuals and a minimally-guided levelling experience that lets you figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself (or with a party of pals, this being an MMO). But Project: Gorgon doesn't solely riff on the rules of the past. It has ideas of its own, such as an NPC relationship system and dynamic environmental systems that let players solve problems like being set on fire by jumping into a lake. Its main attraction though, is a deep, open-ended skill system that enables players to tailor their approach to combat. Potential avenues to explore include a grapple-based unarmed combat system, necromancy that lets you rai…",

The Classic Heads and Classic Faces categories will then be removed from the Marketplace.\" Roblox will be fully REPLACING classic faces and making them dynamic. 🤦‍♂️THEY ARE REMOVING CLASSIC FACES.It doesn't matter if you originally owned the 2D version, it will be removed from the catalog pic.twitter…",

    "body": "Football is the world's most-watched and popular sport, and outside of the World Cup the pinnacle is the English Premier League. Right now we're coming to the end of the mid-season transfer window, where clubs have the opportunity to buy and sell players, and amidst the incessant speculation one of the league's top managers felt the need to remind the football media that the beautiful game is not, in fact, a videogame. The moment arrived during a press conference featuring Tottenham Hotspur manager Thomas Frank, a Danish coach whose witty asides are not quite papering over the fact that the club is having a terrible season. Frank took over in June last year from Ange Postecoglou, a garrulously amusing Australian who committed the cardinal sin of winning something with Spurs and was promptly sacked. Nevertheless the North London club remain one of the biggest around, and one of the players it's been heavily linked to over this transfer window was Antoine Semenyo. Semenyo instead chose to join Manchester City for £62.5m and, while Tottenham have made other signings, Frank was asked to address losing out on one of the club's main targets. \"It was clear, there is no doubt, that the cl…",

Also unsurprisingly, given his competing store and past criticism of Steam, Sweeney approves of the action, and based on his related legal tussles with Apple and Google, thinks there's something to it. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, very broadly alleges that Valve unfairly prevents game makers from offering their products at lower prices on other platforms and requires that all add-on content for games purchased on Steam also be purchased through Steam, and that Valve's \"excessive commission\" has resulted in inflated prices for UK consumers. Valve had argued that the suit should not be allowed to proceed as a collective action—functionally similar to a class action—but a Competition Appeal Tribunal disagreed, ruling earlier this week that the suit can proceed. Sweeney has homed in on the DLC issue specifically. Although developers can sell DLC on other platforms and have it carry over to a user's Steam copy, Valve doesn't allow them to sell add-ons directly through in-game stores or to use th…",

    "body": "Code Vein 2 can feel like a cakewalk for the first hour or so, but you'll quickly hit a wall in the form of Franz the Dejected Assailant . Defeating Franz will change the past and unlock Noah as a companion in the present, so there's a lot on the line here. If you're struggling with the Dejected Assailant like I was, these tips will help you take Franz down so you can continue the main story. Franz the Dejected Assailant phase one I'm just going to level with you here. Parrying makes this boss so much easier. I know parrying sounds scary when the game showers you in shields and other defensive tools, but equipping a Forma that lets you parry attacks is basically a must against the Dejected Assailant. You can get one by talking to one of Jadwiga's Minions in MagMell next to the sparring arena. (Image credit: Bandai Namco) Other than that, make sure Noah is out on the field with you. If you try to duel the Dejected Assailant one-on-one, you'll have a hard time finding safe openings to deal damage, but Noah can help draw aggro away from you. Parry his dash attack: The Dejected Assailant is incredibly aggressive and will close the gap with a lightning-fast dash if you get too far. It'…",

And now, it's even going as far as to characterise itself as helping build a \"rebel alliance\" against Big Tech. The company has released an animation- and graphic-heavy roadmap and report , which in many ways reads like a very dramatic vision statement about how it can challenge the way that AI is developing at the hands of Big Tech. It's kind of bonkers, but in a way that I can't help but get on board with. \"What if a rebel alliance of sorts—developers, activists, researchers, founders, investors—joined forces to build something different?\" It envisions that this alliance will \"push AI in a direction that is trustworthy, human-centered and shaped by all of us.\" Which I suppose explains the focus on turning Firefox into an \"AI browser.\" Regarding this, Mozilla does clarify that its vision for Firefox is one of …",

    "body": "According to a survey of game developers published by GDC —the annual industry conference happening in San Francisco this March—33% of game dev professionals use generative AI for their work. This hasn't changed much since 2021 , when GDC reported that 31% of devs use generative AI, but how they feel about it has dramatically shifted. This year, 52% of the more than 2,300 respondents said that they \"think generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry,\" according to the report's author, Beth Elderkin, who notes that just 18% said the same thing two years ago, and 30% last year. The opposite opinion, that generative AI is good for the industry, was only found in 7% of this year's respondents, a decline from 13% last year. The people least likely to approve of generative AI are who you'd expect: artists, designers, writers, and programmers. The people who use AI the most are also who you'd expect. Ever since CEOs started hyping the technology as a productivity elixir, skeptics have suspected that the executive class is more likely to personally rely on chatbots, and GDC's survey results are consistent with that hypothesis. \"Business professionals' usage (58%) far out…",

A promised crackdown on so-called \"illegal immigrants\" by US president Donald Trump has become a violent free-for-all resulting in multiple killings that the government and security forces have insisted were justified, despite sometimes ample evidence to the contrary. Some countries over the past year have issued travel advisories or cautions for people headed to the US: Canada, for instance, issued a warning in 2025 that anyone with a gender-neutral passport could face difficulty entering the country because of an executive order signed by Trump directing the government to recognize only two \"sexes,\" male and female. The US is also home to a large number of developer conferences and events, and that leaves developers with a tough choice: Put themselves at risk of detention or worse, or miss out on potentially vital opportunities for networking and promotion, which can be particularly important for smaller indie devs. Despite the high cost missing these events can incur, GDC's 2026 State of the Game Industry survey indicates that nearly one-third of industry employees who don't live in the US have cance…",

    "body": "The organizers of GDC have released its 2026 State of the Game Industry Report , detailing the results of its annual self-reported survey of games industry professionals. The data provided by over 2,300 respondents offered a grim image of industry layoffs, as 28% of surveyed games industry workers reported that they had been laid off in the past two years. That percentage was even higher in the United States, where 33% of respondents said they'd been laid off during the same period. 17% of surveyed games industry workers reported having been laid off in just the last 12 months, while half of respondents said their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the last year. The survey results indicate that widespread layoffs remain a persistent issue in the games industry, having intensified during the transition into the post-pandemic era and the fallout of industry expansion and acquisition. More than 16,000 games industry workers lost their jobs between January 2023 and January 2024. 2025 offered little reassurance that the losses would stabilize as job cuts continued at major companies like Microsoft, which dramatically downsized its gaming division while laying off…",

We only get one shot at this,\" a goggled Sam Fisher says in a recognizably Metal Gear Solid call screen. We then see a neck-down shot of Solid Snake skulking through a cloud of smoke, unholstering what appears to be a SOCOM pistol with an unusual sight. The man himself doesn't speak, but he appears to be wearing a sneaking suit similar to this MGS2 look. The teaser ends with the date and time of the full Year 11 roadmap reveal: February 15 at 8AM PT. Some obvious questions arise, such as: Huh? Collaborations are nothing new for Rainbow Six where cosmetics are concerned, but this is the first time a playable operator has come from outside the Tom Clancyverse. And what a whopper of a guest character to start off with. It's also totally strange from a lore standpoint—yes, Siege does have an ongoing story told through seasonal animations.

You might be curious what's new in this new version, or when it will be out, and I'm sorry to say I can't help. A message posted to the Final Fantasy 7 account on X says \"the original Final Fantasy 7 will be re‑released on Steam to provide an improved gameplay experience,\" and directs readers to an announcement on Steam for \"full details.\" And there definitely are more details, although calling it \"full\" is a stretch. The existing game will be renamed to Final Fantasy 7 - 2013 Edition when the new version launches. Existing owners will have access to both versions, but the original will no longer be available for purchase. Save data will not be compatible: 2013 saves won't work in the new release, and vice versa, so if you want to jump into the new one you'll be starting from scratch. And... that's it. What's changed?

It seems like it found an audience, at least, with 500,000 players , a 94% positive rating on Steam and apparently enough success to fuel a new free update . Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Image 2 of 2 (Image credit: Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, Supamonks) Arriving on February 12, the 1.1 patch will make further tweaks and fixes, but more importantly add a raft of new content to give the experience even more replayability. \"Mystic Ordeals\" are customisable modifiers you can apply to runs after you've beaten the final boss, so you can keep testing your skills. And across all runs, there will now be corrupted regions on the map that you can choose to pass through, facing harder enemies but earning stronger rewards in the process. The update's also adding elite mounts—rarer versions with upgraded attacks—as well as new emotes for co-op play and unlockable character skins. …",

You can also grab a free Dexterity booster from one of Jadwiga's Minions in the gear upgrade room of MagMell, too.
