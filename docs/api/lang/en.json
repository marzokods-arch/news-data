The single and music video, which features David Foster on piano and The Christ Church Choir on background vocals, further heightens the original&#8217;s uplifting essence. The song, written by Parton, was produced by Parton and Kent Wells and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. Parton&#8217;s original recording of &#8220;Light of a Clear Blue Morning&#8221; was featured on her 1977 album New Harvest&#8230;First Gathering and rose to No. 11 on Billboard&#8217;s Hot Country Singles chart in June 1977. “I wrote ‘Light of a Clear Blue Morning’ during a season when I was searching for hope, and fifty years later that message still feels just as true,&#8221; Parton said in a statement. &#8220;As I celebrate my 80th birthday, this new version is my way of using what I’ve been blessed with to shine a little light forward, especiall…",
