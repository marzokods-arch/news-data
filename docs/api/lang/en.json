(Itself a newly created town that takes its name from a term popularized by Star Trek .) Neither Musk nor Hegseth seemed to recall that the “Arsenal of Freedom” phrase—at least in the context of Star Trek —is also the title of a 1988 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. That episode depicts an AI-powered weapons system, and its automated salesman, which destroys an entire civilization and eventually threatens the crew of the USS Enterprise .

Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported 124 more cases since last Friday, which had 99 new cases since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to 211 cases . With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.

According to the BLS, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which BLS says represents over 90 percent of the US population across the country, for all items “increased 2.7 percent before seasonal adjustment.” The CPI-U for “subscription and rental of video and video games” includes subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) streaming services, like Netflix and Disney+, and \"one-time rental of video and video game media. These may be rented or subscribed to through physical copy, streaming, or temporary download,\" BLS says . For comparison, \"cable, satellite, and live streaming television service [such as YouTube TV and Sling]\" saw 4.9 percent inflation last year. Read full article Comments",

The new policy also prohibits \"any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles.\" The policy draws a line that some in the music community have debated: Where does tool use end and full automation begin? AI models are not artists in themselves, since they lack personhood and creative intent. But people do use AI tools to make music, and the spectrum runs from using AI for minor assistance (cleaning up audio, suggesting chord progressions) to typing a prompt and letting a model generate an entire track. Bandcamp's policy targets the latter end of that spectrum while leaving room for human artists who incorporate AI tools into a larger creative process. The announcement emphasized the platform's desire to protect its community of human artists. \"The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain,\" the company wrote.

Clifford suffered a massive stroke on March 7, 2024. Subsequent imaging found that the proximal right middle cerebral artery progressed to a complete blockage, causing the stroke.

When researchers dissected the frozen mummified remains of an Ice Age wolf puppy, they found a partially digested chunk of meat in its stomach: the remnants of the puppy’s last meal 14,400 years ago. DNA testing revealed that the meat was a prime cut of woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct 2-metric-ton behemoth that once stomped across the tundras of Europe and Asia. Stockholm University paleogeneticist Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues recently sequenced a full genome from the piece of meat, which reveals some secrets about woolly rhino populations in the centuries before their extinction.

Today, the company is announcing extensive \"personal intelligence\" in Gemini that allows the chatbot to connect to Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to craft more useful answers to your questions. If you don't want Gemini to get to know you, there's some good news. Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it's entirely optional. By every measure, Google's models are at or near the top of the AI heap . In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it's relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini. As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses. …",
