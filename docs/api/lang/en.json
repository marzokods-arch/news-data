    "body": "It's been 10 years since the debut of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and nine since the release of the second and final expansion, Blood and Wine. But while CD Projekt is now full steam ahead on The Witcher 4 , there are rumblings—not much more than vibrations, really—of something new coming for Witcher 3. Ears pricked up following a Strefa Inwestorów report ( Google translated ) quoting Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicting a Witcher 3 expansion for May 2026. \"We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026,\" Chrzanowski said. \"We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million ($14.5 million). The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.\" That's not a whole lot to go on, but it does make sense. Chrzanowski also said he expects The Witcher 4 to launch in Q4 2027, which puts it in the admittedly massively open-ended time frame of 'not until after 2026' previously shared by CD Projekt. New Witcher 3 DLC would also be a guaranteed moneymaker. Some quick napkin math: CD Projekt has now sold more than 60 million copies, and if we assume a DL…",

Press it and Hornet will widen her stance and yell \"Garama!\" to call enemies toward her. It can be surprisingly useful if you need to bring an enemy close enough to jump on them. Today I learned that it also does damage, and someone is currently trying to beat the entire game with it, because of course they are. YouTube user Bloblumordthe3rd calls the playthrough \"Garama%\" and releases a new video every week or so showing off their progress. They are by no means racing through the game with an ability that can only be barely described as lethal: Every fight takes ages as they patiently wait for the best moment to Garama! It took two hours of attempts to defeat the final boss of act 1, for example. The comments on Bloblumordthe3rd's videos are full of people surprised the taunt even does damage and that anyone would dare to actually use it in combat. \"This is like watching Sisyphus push the boulder and win,\" ParrotingCrow wrote. \"Silksanity will truly never end,\" LetsGetAwesome711 added.

Replays are usually something born from necessity, like work-related tasks, or my insatiable nostalgia for old RPGs. Anything else is an anomaly, but I'm happy to report that, at the behest of no one, I played Complusion's gothic action adventure game South of Midnight three times over the last eight months, so I reckon that means I like it. To be clear, that's two more times than I was asked to play for our South of Midnight review . I went at it a second time at my own leisure, then followed up again with a third replay so a friend could watch me, but I'll be damned if I didn't find some easy-to-miss, tiny detail with every press of 'new game' that made me fall in love with Hazel's journey through the American South all over again.

A passenger in the car was also killed in the crash. Zampella was a colossal figure in videogames, with his first major credit being lead designer on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. He'd go on to co-found Infinity Ward with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002, which not only created Call of Duty but reinvented it (and mainstream shooters more widely) with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. After a split with Activision Zampella and West co-founded Respawn, which has released the beloved Titanfall games, Apex Legends, and two Star Wars Jedi games. In the 24 hours since the news broke, industry figures have been sharing their shock at Zampella's death, and memories of their time working with him. One word of warning: while preparing this article I did the usual Google / social media searches for Zampella's name. If you do that on sites such as X you risk coming across some widely distributed footage of a crash: you don't want to see it, and it's also unclear whether the clips are legit…",

The 1985 masterpiece probably doesn't seem like the most obvious source of inspiration for a creator known for cinematic excess and overarching narrative ambition but, as Kojima goes on to point out, it's one hell of a good game. \"Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home,\" laughs Kojima. \"Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't have been in this industry. Yeah. I can't really play it now, though. It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button, use that and the jump subtly changes the trajectory to attack or dodge.\" That's exactly what set Super Mario Bros. apart from other platformers of the time, the balance and subtlety in speed and how that would affect your…",

As I said in my Keep Driving review , I grew up in the US in a town that had—like many towns in the US—no real public transportation, so my first taste of real freedom was when I got my first car, a heavily used hand-me-down green Plymouth Horizon hatchback. I loved that clunky car, mostly because of what it represented: a chance to escape my house and my town and set out on the road with no real destination, only occasionally checking the map, blasting music, and paying for gas a few dollars at a time. Gotta save some cash for snacks. Keep Driving delivers impeccable vibes from a time when the stress of school was slowly being replaced by the clawing panic of having to figure out what comes after school. A real job. Re…",

There's a lot to love about its depiction of post-nuclear Boston if you're willing to overlook the fact that you solve most problems with a gun. One aspect of Fallout 4 I haven't considered much, however, is its replayability. But it's a point that design director Emil Pagliarulo feels strongly about, as he recently discussed. Speaking to GamesRadar , Pagliarulo explained how he believed the RPGs interweaving questlines—whereby the factions you support affect the choices available to you in the main quest—make it the most replayable Fallout game. Pagliarulo began explaining his position by talking about Fallout 3 . \"The interesting thing about Fallout 3 is there are no faction quests,\" Pagliarulo observed, a fact which separates Bethesda's first stab at Fallout from its Elder Scrolls RPGs. \"For Fallout 4, it was the first time we said, 'You play Skyrim and you play these factions, but they're disconnected from …",

Now there's more. The pair of Xbox 360 devkits that contain the build also have a drive containing early versions, in some cases very early versions, of the New Vegas DLC. The recovered files include PDBs with debug information that's invaluable in reverse-engineering efforts, and now the intrepid explorers have accessed cut content from the expansions, although some of it is far from what would be considered playable. Perhaps the biggest find is in the third DLC, Old World Blues, which has significant differences from the release version, and in particular a room that's restored to former glory. In the release version of Old World Blues there's a VR room that has been wrecked, and has no functionality. Here it works. Kinda.

Last week I was: Coping a little about Hades 2. 2025 was a bloody year for MMORPGs as a genre. And by bloody, I actually mean catastrophic: New World announced it'd be closing, Greg Street's MMO had its funding pulled , that ZeniMax game was killed before it could even hit the market, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled . But World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 survived—which… isn't really any sort of surprise, really. In the world of MMOs, the old guard will always stand strong. It'll take more than a deeply ominous state of the industry (and the fact that no-one seems to get to make MMOs anymore ) to take these big boys down. Yet there's trouble in paradise: In a fascinating bit of coincidence , both World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14 are in for a very interesting 2026 (and beyond). How either game is handled in this fateful year will set the tone for years to come. Turning that ship around Final Fantasy 14 has, as I and my fellow FF14 enjoyer Mollie Taylor have often said on this website, been in a weird state .…",

On a personal level, what I wanted from Bloodlines 2 was basically 'Bloodlines 1, but fixed', an RPG that took all the wild, unconstrained ambition of the original and brought it up to modern standards with a new story and exploratory space on top. Yet while Bloodlines 2 had its merits—like its brilliant Malkavian detective companion Fabien—it was mechanically much simpler than Troika's game, while also lacking meaningful side-quests and any real sense of character progression. But if, like me, you're worried that we might never see a truly great vampire RPG, hold that thought. Next year, Rebel Wolves is due to release The Blood of Dawnwalker , and it might just be the vampire RPG we've been waiting for. As a reminder, The Blood of Dawnwalker is being made by Rebel Wolves, a Polish studio founded by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. If you're not familiar with Tomaszkiewicz's name, he was director of a little game called The Witcher 3 . And get this, Tom…",

As reported by TheGamer , Five Nights at Freddy's 2 currently stands as one of the worst-rated movie releases of 2025. That's right, it's not just a terrible adaptation, it's seemingly a terrible movie full stop. It's currently positioned as the third worst film out of the 429 with more than seven critic reviews on Metacritic this year, with a measly aggregation of just 26 out of 100. It's only three points better than Bride Hard but still miles (20 points) better than the current worst-rated film of the year—War of the Worlds, which from what I have been told is an awful lot of Ice Cube staring at screens peppered in with some not-so-subtle Amazon product placement.

The game received two new expansions which introduced player-created freelance missions and an overhauled mining experience, as five new ships. CCP's stats suggest these expansions went down well. Players created 9,130 missions for chancing mercenaries to take up, while the most popular new ship, the Pioneer, was manufactured 71,873 times, and destroyed 4,513 times. Players across the game also destroyed 12,406 player-made 'upwell' structures, which presumably led to a helluva lot of insurance claims. The number that really stood out to me, however, is how much ISK—EVE's in-game currency—was incinerated in the course of all this destruction. According to CCP, that number totals 1,142,260,784,813,930 ISK. That's more than one quadrillion ISK that went up in flames over the last twelve months. More than 10 to the power 15, or, as I prefer to think of it, an absolute shedload. I was curious what the real-dollar value of this massive amount of ISK might be, so I had a go at figuring it out.

Windows treats most drives as SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), which has been used for decades now and largely intended for hard drives. As such, NVMe drives that offer higher parallel performance than a hard drive are somewhat limited by the SCSI conversion: taking NVMe commands from an NVMe SSD and changing them to SCSI for the benefit of the OS, which introduces processing overhead and latency. You can see this for yourself by going into your PC's device manager -> Standard NVM Express Controller -> properties -> details -> class. It will be described as 'SCSIAdapter'. But Microsoft just announced that native NVMe support is now available in Windows Server 2025 ; essentially circumventing the entire conversion process and speeding things along. \"Switch onto Native NVMe as soon as possible or you are leaving performance gains on the table!\" Microsoft says in the announcement blog post. \"With Native NVMe in Windows Server 2025, the storage stack is purpose-built for modern hardware—eliminating translation layers and legacy constraints.\" (…",

But the team is just getting started. \"2025 was more of a warm-up period for us,\" Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo told Den of Geek . \"Next year, we're going to have bigger plans. We're not going to slow down. We've already planned more than a year ahead and I can't wait for our players to see it.\" I've been ruthlessly cutting live service games out of my library this month, as the dopamine hit from the endless progression is no longer justifying all the cracking traditional singleplayer games that have fallen by the wayside. So I'm on a Marvel Rivals break at the moment, but I sure played a lot of it this year. I went from being more than a sceptic, hating how it felt to play and what NetEase had done to some of my favourite characters, like Magneto , to becoming a convert. The beta put me off, but shortly after launch I was hooked. It completely destroyed any interest I had left in Overwatch 2—tho…",

The settlement put an end to a two-and-a-half year-long saga which as recently reported by Game File , took some wild twists and turns as it wended its way through court. At various stages, the suit witnessed accusations of demonic possession, lawyers throwing down Lil Wayne lyrics, and Aspyr desperately trying to conceal what it believes to be vital trade secrets. The lawsuit kicked off in late summer 2023, with gamer Malachi Mickelonis suing Aspyr for alleged consumer fraud after feeling \"completely duped\" the company, who had released KOTOR 2 on Switch in 2022. In a YouTube trailer for the port, Asypr had briefly noted that a DLC built using the Restored Content Mod would be coming to Switch in Q3 that year. However, this DLC failed to materialise and was ultimately cancelled. Mickelonis was represented by former corporate lawyer Ray …",

Why not? Because it slopes backward, and they'll end up on the floor. The front support foot is slightly taller than the back one, giving it a lean of, if a fun 10 minutes spent with a spirit level and a child's protractor have produced correct results, about 10 degrees. This means you can still rest your coffee mug on the top, as long as it's not too full, but also that, if you're buying this smaller-than-average tower PC with the intention of it flitting flush with a piece of furniture, it won't. This may or may not be a problem, depending on how picky you are about these things, but the Predator logo that sticks off the front and looks rather like someone melded a Space Invader with a Decepticon means you might want to push it back a little further. Despite its drunken lean, it's not a bad case. The front panel ports are easy to get to, there's a bit of RGB behind that logo, and it's nicely compact at 28 litres, though slightly larger than previous Orion 3000 cases, which were 26 lit…",

If you're not familiar with subpixel layouts, here's why that's a very good thing. Today's OLED gaming monitors have an issue. Not a huge one for gaming—any OLED is superb for playing games on—but more noticeable on some panels than others when you're browsing your desktop. It's especially noticeable if you're regularly typing out pages of words. It's called text fringing. Text fringing, as the name suggests, appears as a colourful border around characters rendered on an OLED panel. Sort of like a chromatic aberration effect in-game. It happens because the subpixels—red, green, and blue—don't align exactly with how the text is being rendered. In some OLED panels, that's because the subpixels are arranged in a triangular pattern, though LG's popular panels include a white subpixel in an RGWB structure. Text fringing is most obvious on panels with lower pixel densities, so namely 1440p monitors, though it'd be better to be rid of it completely. Well, that's what LG is offering with its latest OLED panel. Announced ahead of CES 2026, LG'…",

It's big and roomy and weighs a ton, with enough glass to satisfy your curiosity about what's going on inside and three light-up fans on the front to look good. There are three more fans at the top—the CPU is liquid cooled with an AIO—an intake at the back, and the GPU is vertically mounted so its cooling system is on display. This is a PC that wants to leave you in no doubt that it's on top of its heat dissipation. The front of the PC is the part you'll see most often, and Acer has chosen to place a 3D Predator logo behind a transparent front panel that stands proud of the case itself, a mesh-sided extrusion that gives hot air somewhere to escape around the edges and has a good, deep power button on the top you can easily find while groping around beneath your desk.

It's primarily designed for mid-core players, he says: People who like to seek out a challenge in open-world content and the solo-dungeon style encounters of Delves. But the difficulty of Prey ramps up quickly, and top-end encounters should provide challenges even for mythic-geared raiders, should they decide to become the hunted. \"Prey is inherently an overlay system,\" Smith says. \"So regardless of the content you engage with in the open world, you will also be dealing with Prey.\" Pick your target and become the hunted (Image credit: Sykeen / Blizzard Entertainment) Players interact with an NPC in Silvermoon city to pick their difficulty, zone, and target from a collection of 30 bosses.

The Arcane Pickaxe is available in Stonewake's Cross, but you'll need to navigate through the deepest depths of the first zone's cave to get your hands on it. It's not a quest I'd suggest rushing, even if you help the Bard find his lost instrument early on. The higher level zombies really take a bite out of your HP in bigger mobs. How to get the Arcane Pickaxe in The Forge You can get the Arcane Pickaxe for $125,000 in The Cave, the first zone's mining spot, after completing the Bard's lost guitar quest. It's easy to complete in just a few minutes when you know where to look, but making use of the Bard's Unknown Key takes patience. It's not worth proceeding if you don't have the cash, and I wound up waiting until I was on the last Goblin King quest before going back to buy the pickaxe.

Offline modes will continue to function as normal.

It's also a fairly standard period of full functionality for 2K's WWE games. WWE 2K23 servers took a piledriver in January 2025 , 2K22 servers ate an RKO in '24, and four pre-2K21 games were put through tables at the same time in 2022.

Behind the scenes, developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were desperately trying to save the project, but these efforts would come to naught: a last-ditch attempt involving publisher Take-Two collapsed when no agreement could be reached over the IP rights . There was also debate over how much of the ace-looking reveal had been smoke-and-mirrors, with one dev angrily refuting the idea there wasn't a game there . Joanna Dark's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan was vocal about the cancellation at the time, and has now given a new interview to The Gamer in which she expands on what had been done on the game, and the \"devastating\" decision to cancel it. \"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed,\" says Wilton Regan. \"I did not see it coming.

I've often gone on record to defend parrying on this site, despite the haters: Done well, these games are awesome. Parry fatigue? Bah, I say!

It can become a delicious game of rock, paper, scissors that sees you riding a knife's edge between victory and death. Redirecting lightning at the top of Ashina Castle is utterly imprinted onto my memory, nothing else can compare.

Accidental replication is certainly an error common among AI-generated images, as anyone who has seen AI-generated pictures of humans with far too many fingers will understand.

THPS was once among the biggest series of the late '90s and early aughts, but their legacy doesn't carry as much weight in PC gaming. Nor does it for me: The sole Tony Hawk I owned back in the day was THUG 2, the 2004 successor series to Pro Skater that let you get off the board and run around (which is what I ended up doing most of the time). No, instead I was an annoying Skate fan who preferred to kickflip with the right stick and insisted Tony Hawk was too arcadey or unrealistic. How's it feel to be a mega wrong dummy, teen Morgan?

John Carmack's reproduction of the smooth scrolling effect seen in Nintendo's platformer ultimately led to the founding of id Software and the creation of Commander Keen . In turn this led to Wolfenstein 3D , and ultimately to Doom . Yet as id Software prepared to revolutionise PC gaming, its publisher, Apogee, took the tech id had developed for Commander Keen and made its own take on the 2D platformer. The result was Bio Menace, a platform shooter in which you battle through a city infested with mutants as all-American action hero Snake Logan. Bio Menace was created almost entirely by programmer Jim Norwood, who worked on the Duke Nukem Trilogy and, later, the original Shadow Warrior and its 2013 reboot. Apogee released Bio Menace as freeware in 2005, and it can be played online in various places. But the original has, understandably, aged quite a bit. Fortunately, a remaster just released on Steam, sprucing up this classic blaster for modern players. Developed by Rigel Gameworks, BioMenace Remastere…",

No cars, no luxury pads, not even a Michelin Star meal. Nope, what Beer splashed out on was something a bit more understated: \"A real winter coat\". It's hard not to be charmed by this, just as I was when Zach Adams bought a humble Honda Civic after Dwarf Fortress shifted 800,000 copies. To be fair, he and his wife also purchased a house.
