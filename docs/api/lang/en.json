    "body": "Give PC gamers a shooter, and they will extract the movement tech locked within it. Arc Raiders is an intentionally hefty shooter that rewards positioning and stealth over lightning-quick reflexes, but players are still finding techniques that speed you up or assist a daring escape. If you want to add a little spice to your raids, you can and should learn the ways of the ledge grab . By holding spacebar as you fall, your raider will catch any nearby ledge and hoist up. The timing is generous, and it doesn't seem to matter how far or fast you're falling before you grab the ledge. With a little practice, and an eye for what is and isn't a valid ledge, you can confidently start jumping off somewhat large gaps without worrying about fall damage. String a few grabs together and you can even quickly descend a tall building . The tricky part is that chaining grabs together requires letting go of a grab before you climb the ledge. Of course, you can also take it to extremes by leaping off a cliff, crossing your fingers, and aiming for something to grab—like in this clip below, where a street light turns into a quick-descent elevator. There's so much sick movement tech in this game! The po…",

Something I didn't get too deeply into when I gushed about Tavern Keeper last week is its item design tool. There are all sorts of objects to build in your tavern, from useful furniture like tables, chairs, and beds to decorative items like bookcases, paintings, and rugs—but that's just the start. Tavern Keeper also invites players to modify existing items or create their own with its in-game design tool and share them with other players. I've only done some basic modifications so far, like decorating countertops with items like gold coins, goblets, playing cards, and perhaps a dagger half-buried in the wood of a table.

    "body": "The most notable thing about this year's list of PC Gamer's highest review scores is what doesn't appear on it. Many of the games that are in the running for one of our Game of the Year awards aren't represented, including Elden Ring Nightreign, Battlefield 6, Europa Universalis 5, Arc Raiders, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Those games all received favorable scores by our standards, just not quite favorable enough to pass the bar I've set here, which is 89%-and-up. Clair Obscur received what was probably our most controversial score of the year at 70% —still a recommendation for the French RPG, though not the shining praise it got elsewhere. (Including from some of PCG's other writers.) Reviews aren't a measure of popularity or an attempt to arrive at the average opinion, so I don't consider these notable absences a bug. There's a lot to appreciate about the two most-played new games right now, Battlefield 6 ( 82% ) and Arc Raiders ( 86% ), but to get a really high score, a game has to inspire an individual reviewer to go out on a limb and champion it, perhaps even pushing back on editors whose responsibility it is to ask, \"OK, but is it actually a 92%?\" As 2025 draws to a clos…",

    "body": "When Silksong arrived in early September it was close to a perfect launch, save one glaring problem: Chinese players quickly cottoned on to some big issues with the Chinese translation, namely that it failed to capture the tone of the Hollow Knight universe. \"This isn't about effort, but about taste and direction,\" an English-to-Chinese translator noted at the time. Another expert noted that its tone resembled \"a high-school drama club's Elizabethan improv night.\" That sounds pretty bad. As a result, Silksong's Steam rating briefly fell to \"mostly negative\", and ever since a fan group called Team Cart Fix has been working away in the background to improve the Chinese translation. The fruits of their labour have been available as an unofficial mod for a while, but now, in Silksong's new Patch 4, the work of Team Cart Fix has been officially implemented in the game. \"Their translation builds from elements of the original Silksong translation, retaining existing names for most characters and places, except in instances where the original translation was incorrect, or inconsistent with Hollow Knight,\" Team Cherry writes . \"Most importantly, this is a translation by fans who are well-v…",

And just like last time, it's about to make sweeping changes to loot that feel like table-setting for an expansion-level update. Blizzard released a roadmap at the start of the year and pretty much everything on it has come and gone. A few things have shifted around—like leaderboards coming earlier than expected next season—but the new expansion for 2026 still hasn't been announced. In a recent interview with Diablo 4 streamer Rob2628 , the developers gave a pretty clear hint on when the expansion news will finally arrive. Rob brought up an image recently datamined from the game that reads December 12 in Chinese, which happens to be the same day (taking time zones in account) as this year's The Game Awards show. He asked associate game director Zaven Haroutunian and lead live game designer Colin Finer if Diablo fans should watch it. Haroutunian, leaning close to his webcam and smiling, replied, \"Everyone should be watching it. We're all gamers, we're gonna watch it.\" I think that's about as close to an official tease as you're going to…",

As promised by DICE lead producer David Sirland last week, the quality-of-life update will address the gun dispersion issues, incorrect vehicle spawns, the unstoppable lock-on missile , and most notably, the \"drone hammer\" bug that let players levitate on command. That last bug fix could be a particularly big ideal, as folks were using the levitation exploit to get high up on maps that have no air vehicles and land on out-of-bounds rooftops on Siege of Cairo. This is also the first major update for Redsec, Battlefield 6's free-to-play battle royale mode. That knocks a few big problems off the to-do list, though to be honest, my biggest gripes with Battlefield 6 are problems that will take a lot longer to address: the lack of big maps and the terrible UI. Sirland acknowledged both topics in his AMA last week, but gave no timeline or indicated they were huge priorities. The good news is we're getting one new big map next week: Eastwood .

He is a Man very self evidently made of Bones, so we're not exactly solving a riddle for the ages here. Still, Arabella's patter with Withers is a charming, unexpected bit of writing that punches above its weight in shading more depth into both characters: Withers clearly has a soft spot for children, and Arabella has no problem chopping it up with an immortal watcher. Seeing more of that relationship is certainly welcome. After finding Arabella's dead parents but before telling her about their fate, she was supposed to have a brief back-and-forth with Withers at the party camp where she tweaks his nose and settles on the Bone Man nickname. \"I am not a 'skellie,' thou shalt call me Withers,\" the reluctant avatar of cosmic judgement peevishly intones. \"'Withers?'

Titled the Bazaar update, the patch adds 24 maps appropriately themed around covered marketplaces, as well as 18 'basket' maps, 10 Hushardzan maps (I don't know what a hushardzan is, but it's fun to say), and four additional maps with no shared theme.

Built by maker Changliang Li , his Windows 98 handheld gaming PC plays all the contemporaneous hits, like StarCraft and Tomb Raider II (with of-the-era frame rates, too). Contained in a 3D printed, plastic shell spray painted an authentic shade of yellow that harkens back to its forebears, the homebrew handheld even features a Logitech rollerball mouse (via Hackaday ). As for mouse clicks , those are tied to a lonely little trigger button on the top right-hand corner of the console. It's a control scheme that looks as nightmarish as it is extra, but that's not the most interesting facet of the project. Given how svelte APU chips have to be to fit inside even the bulkiest of today's best handheld gaming PCs , it's worth remembering how bulky 90s desktop mainboards used to be—so, how does this throwback build achieve such a reasonable form factor?

The anniversary has got Bethesda creative chief Todd Howard in a reflective mood, and he's revealed some interesting details about the creation of the game and what the RPG maestros learned from it. One of the main things Bethesda learned is that cinematic, Mass Effect-style dialogue systems are a bad fit for Bethesda games. In an interview with GQ , Howard was asked what he thought the best game he'd worked on is. Responding diplomatically, Howard pointed to several features of multiple games, while also mentioning that some things \"didn't resonate\" with players. After a bit of coaxing, Howard revealed that Fallout 4's dialogue system was one of them. \"We spent forever on the dialogue system in Fallout 4,\" Howard said. \"'How do we do an interactive conversation in an interesting way? How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way.\" Elaborating on why the dialogue system didn't resonate, Howard explained …",

But BG2 didn't emerge in a vacuum, and in a recent chat with Slandered Gaming it emerged that—while we can thank BG2 for a lot of our favourite RPGs since—we have a whole other game to thank for BG2. That'd be Final Fantasy 7, which lit a fire under BG2 director James Ohlen to go all out with the game's structure and companions, per Trent Oster—who worked on the original Baldur's Gate and has since become CEO of Beamdog, the studio behind the BG1 and BG2 Enhanced Editions. \"So, James had played Final Fantasy 7, and they had character interaction and romance, and he was scared shitless,\" recalls Oster.

It launched in early access a year ago, but it's been on my mind again thanks to Arc Raiders , the current new hotness. Before Arc Raiders' explosive launch , our reviewer, Elie, was telling me why they were digging it so much, and it became clear that it coincidentally shared a lot with what I remain convinced is the genre's high point. And I suspect that if you're having a blast with Arc Raiders at the moment, then you'll also have a great time with The Forever Winter.

That hasn't stopped some pesky console exclusives slipping through the net over the years, but these days most are coming across. Most of the best PlayStation games to play on PC come directly from Sony themselves. You only need to scroll through our review section to find deep dives into PS5's biggest hitters that have landed not long after their initial PS5 releases. I've been a PC player for a long time, as well as working across two console mags: Official PlayStation Magazine and PLAY Magazine. I first played the iconic PS1 titles Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 7, and even PS2's Silent Hill 2 on PC. Now, the most exciting new game releases on PS5 don't take long to come to PC. It's a thrill to not only play fab indie gems on the Steam Deck, but take PS5 games on the go that would otherwise be bound to a big screen at home. I've even reviewed some of the best PlayStation games to play on PC for PC Gamer myself! So join me as I rank them below, and take a look at what you might expect to see in the future.

But there may be another reason behind those layoffs, namely that the player count for Dune: Awakening is dwindling. In fact, for the first time since Dune: Awakening launched, the number of players recently dropped below that of Funcom's other survival MMO, Conan Exiles, which released way back in 2018. The shift was spotted by Reddit user m3d1t8 (via GamesRadar ), who posted a screenshot showing that, at the time it was taken, 7,458 players were exploring Arrakis, while 7,706 players were enjoying Conan Exiles. \"The unbelievable has happened and Dune now has fewer active players than Conan,\" m3d1t8 marvelled, adding. \"I remember two months ago someone foreseeing that Dune would dip below Conan and thinking no wayyyy.

However, company CEO He Xiaopeng has since attempted to expose the Iron's mechanical innards, both on-stage and off (via Mashable ). After offering a sneak peek of what lies beneath the Iron's soft shell on social media , Xiaopeng then took to the stage for a more drastic demonstration. For the banishment of all doubt, the Xpeng robotics team took a pair of scissors to the Iron, cutting away not only its soft outer shell but its artificial muscles as well, completely exposing the metal rod supports and servos below. The Iron is very clearly not a person in a morph suit—however, that doesn't mean it's the future either. The smoothness of this robot's movements across a completely flat surface is impressive, though I'm a little unclear on what gap in the market the Iron hopes to fill as it approaches mass …",

With that said, there is no information regarding its contents, or when to expect it. Only that there will be another update in due course. In fact, the video opens the floor to players to share what they'd like to see when REPO receives its next drop rather than the decision being down to the devs. Since we've just received a fresh batch of monsters, I can't imagine we'll be getting any new creatures any time soon, but a lot of people are keen to see new locations over anything else. As part of the monster update, REPO received a bunch of new valuables too, each corresponding to their location rather than being a random selection available through each map.

This is certainly true. You see TSMC chips in everything from the latest Blackwell GPUs (like the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 ) to the AI chips that have helped prop up Nvidia's worth. Huang told the crowd, \"You are really the pride of Taiwan, you are also the pride of the world, and you know that you are also my pride\". Huang was born in Taiwan and has Taiwanese citizenship, which might give extra reason for that last part. TSMC is in a unique spot for Taiwan, being one of the biggest companies in the country.

Elsewhere, a French website Dealabs (via Gamespot ) provided further evidence of the symbols' authenticity, discovering the words \"crossbuy-tag\" within some CSS files on the PlayStation Store.

That is to say, it's not traded on a stock exchange and it doesn't have shareholders whispering in its ear demanding it chase whatever short-term trend is currently driving up share prices. Unlike Epic, Amazon, Ubisoft, or EA (though, uh, I suppose that last one's set to change ), Valve only really has to answer to its president, Gabe Newell, and he's busy buying yacht companies . Indeed, in an alternate universe where Valve does have a cabal of pension funds and who-knows-what else setting its direction, we'd probably already have some sort of dreadful AI chatbot integrated…",

YouTuber and minimalist hardware extraordinaire Vimpo has created a tiny custom Minecraft server implementation for machines with limited resources—and to show off its potential, they've got it running on a smart bulb , of all things. The Aliexpress-bought Wi-Fi lightbulb had the glass structure sawn off with a serrated knife, exposing the tiny BL602 RISC-V chip inside, before the board was soldered to a surrogate microcontroller with an appropriate USB port and a few extra wires. This looks to have enabled the now Frankenstein-ed bulb board to run Vimpo's own Minecraft server implementation, called Ucraft. Controlling the bulb-based server with the help of a few other devices, including a small external display and a full-sized keyboard that frankly dwarfs every other piece of hardware involved, results in a very-playable looking implementation. If you'd like a poke around in Ucraft's files, Vimpo has uploaded their work to GitHub . The server binary size is a mere 46 KB without the authentication library and 90 KB with it onboard, while the memory usage is sai…",

You'll no doubt have already experienced this firsthand in the A Reveal in Ruins quest for Lance earlier on. So you're not stumbling around and increasing your odds of getting gunned down every second you waste, here are the four locations you need to check to complete Life of a Pharmacist. I'll note that since you don't need to extract anything, using a free loadout isn't a bad idea. How to complete Life of a Pharmacist in Arc Raiders You need to 'document' the pharmacist's family, skills, hobbies, and taste to complete Life of a Pharmacist, which is cryptic as far as quest objectives go. As demonstrated in the video above, head to the Arbusto Farmacia pharmacy in Piazza Arbusto near the centre of Buried City and go upstairs. Here's what you need to do for each of the objectives: Family : Interact with the family photos directly ahead of you at the top of the stairs. Skills : Turn right from the family photos and interact with the piano.…",

Arc Raiders has been on a monumental run since it launched a couple of weeks back. Hitting 100,000 concurrent players in just 30 minutes and briefly surpassing Battlefield 6 in concurrent players a few days ago, it seems like the gaming world has been enamoured with Embark's new extraction shooter, and I can't see the enthusiasm waning anytime soon. (Image credit: Embark) Just 14 hours ago, at the time of writing, Arc Raiders managed to hit another milestone: overtaking Helldivers 2 in all-time peak of concurrent players, reaching 462,488 or 462,485, plus my two friends and I. Helldivers 2, in contrast, has an all-time peak of just 458,709 , and that's including my squad. This milestone puts into context just how popular Arc Raiders is, and how quickly it's managed to rise up to sit comfortably with some of the biggest releases in the last few years, let alone 2025, which was a pretty strong year for shooters.

On November 7, Owlcat shared the game's main theme from composer Paweł Perepelica, who previously scored Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader for the studio. It's hard get crazy excited about music from an upcoming game, but Osiris Reborn's main theme kinda goes. That combination of a very space opera, orchestral sound with more cyberpunk synths puts me right back in that 2007, saving the galaxy headspace. It doesn't hurt that Mass Effect and The Expanse draw from the same well of gritty, '90s and aughts, military-inflected, Sci-Fi Syfy Channel sci-fi⁠—even if Mass Effect tempered it with a more wide eyed, mid-20th century sensibility.

More recently, YouTuber Fully Buffered (via Tom's Hardware ) got the game to run on an AMD FX-9590 CPU , first released in 2013, revealing that the game's stated minimum required specs are a bit misleading. Fully Buffered broke down his process in the above video, where he shows the game running on the 12-year-old chip to a quality standard he calls \"not terrible.\" It peaks at around mid-40 FPS at lower resolutions, though input lag kneecaps the feasibility of playing this way for very long. The poor GPU, an RX 5700, is shown hovering around 30% utilization in Task Manager, its potency shown a hard ceiling by the comparatively ancient processor.
