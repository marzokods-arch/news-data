I always wondered how people managed to play Plants vs. Zombies with a controller, and it turns out they had some help—a trigger-activated magnet that draws sunlight toward the cursor so you don't have to frantically zip around the screen trying to collect it while you're also harvesting coins and replacing tall-nuts. It's mapped to the spacebar in Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted now, and it's a definite improvement. Especially if you're playing at faster speeds, which is something that's now easier to modify on the fly. The tab key lets you cycle between different speeds, and hotkeys for the seed packets you've brought with you are now mapped to the number keys too. Which is nice. This latest update also gets rid of \"incorrect placeholder assets\" in the almanac, which players claimed had been AI-upscaled , and makes the gu…",

The trailer showcases the Hive Scum's crowbar, one of the class' improvised melee weapons (they can also swing a saw), as well as their dual-wielded guns. For the first time in Darktide you'll be able to go full Rise of the Triad with either autopistols or stub pistols. You can also dual-wield shivs in melee. The Hive Scum's other selling point is better living through chemistry. They can buff themselves with a customizable stimm called the Cartel Special and turn their drugs against enemies by throwing chem bombs and coating their saw in a variety of toxins. Like all of Darktide's player-characters the Hive Scum gets plenty of cosmetic options, with full-body tattoos and punk hairstyles, and they're the only class to have access to face paints so far.

You might think that all this anticipation was prompted by some big leak: Did dataminers finally discover definitive proof that Half-Life 3 is coming soon? Well, people claim to have found definitive proof of Half-Life 3 in every other Counter-Strike update, so probably, but that's not what prompted this week's hype. For the most part, the evidence in support of an announcement happening today seems to be: Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx on November 18, 2019 Today is also November 18 Half-Life 1 released on November 19, which is also a date in November Half-Life 2 released on November 16, and that, too, is a date in November Geoff Keighley posted a 👀 emoji Don't cancel your dinner plans, in other words.

Anno 117: Pax Romana, which released on November 12, has been met with \"Mixed\" reviews on Steam and has been the target of complaints about the use of AI to create in-game assets . But, according to Ubisoft, that hasn't stopped the city builder from breaking a few records. Anno 117: Pax Romana is \"the fastest-selling title in the franchise’s 25-year history,\" Ubisoft said in an email to PC Gamer. Ubisoft also said that with an average of 85 on Metacritic (PC Gamer's Anno 117: Pax Romana review scores it an 80) and a 94% \"Recommended\" on OpenCritic (with an average score of 84), Anno 117 has become \"the highest-rated Anno in the franchise's history.\" Steam reviewers haven't been as generous. Amid scattered complaints of bugginess, a shortened campaign, and connection issues with its co-op mode, one user summed it up with the most damning sort of praise a game can get: \"Anno is fine.\" Most of the negative reviews are focused on how unhappy players are that AI assets have been used in the game. This is the first Ubisoft game to post an \"AI ge…",

Nobody thinks the lady with the big deadly sword is a healer, but they also can't figure out if she's going to be a tank or a damage-dealer. Usually, Blizzard makes it pretty clear how a character will play in the game, even if their reveal cinematic is mostly focused on their backstory and isn't captured in-game. Vendetta's video is a tricky case because we see her cut apart a robot—pretty damaging by any measure—but also block its shots with her gigantic sword almost like a tank would. That's not unprecedented: Overwatch already has tank heroes, like Junker Queen, who could easily be mistaken for damage-dealers because they don't carry around a big shield like Reinhardt. It doesn't help that Blizzard hasn't clarified what role Vendetta will be in the video's description or on social media, leaving it to fans to try to suss out the answer. But here's the thing: Blizzard, or at least a PR agency representing it, already confirmed Vendetta's role in an email to press right after the trailer went out. PC Gamer, along w…",

Historically, scrap has been pretty easy to get, and its abundance throughout the map made crafting upgraded workbenches easy. Playing it safe and farming scrap around your base meant fewer people out in the world for PvP, but the strategy worked. As a solo player, I could visit monuments to find a little treat, but I didn't need to venture into the wild as soon as possible. The update largely reduces scrap cost, but tacks on a new material requirement with two types of Blueprint Fragments. You can get lucky and find some of them, but monuments have guaranteed drops in special puzzle rooms.

Honest mistake, though, and to Valve's credit it offered developer Permadeath a small makeup: an opportunity to spotlight Planet Centauri as one of Steam's Daily Deals, \"as a way to help make up for lost visibility.\" The studio has since moved on to other things, because there really wasn't any choice in the matter, but despite some misgivings it did eventually decide to take Valve up on the offer. So, as reported by Polygon , a little over a month ago Permadeath signed up for the Daily Deal spotlight on one of the dates offered by Valve: November 12.

Project Misriah: Halo Ports, a collection of Counter-Strike 2 custom maps that recreate classic Halo 3 multiplayer in Valve's freshly rebooted FPS, is so good that it's frustrating. Released yesterday on the CS2 workshop by mappers Froddoyo, Lydran, and ORB-NRG, Project Misriah is a lot more than a map pack containing faithful recreations of Homefront, High Ground, and Ghost Town. The mod also recreates the mechanics of Halo 3 as closely as possible within Valve's toolset, replacing most of the base game's arsenal with Halo guns spanning the series, tweaking ballistics so you're actually accurate while moving (a wild concept), lowering gravity, raising the time-to-kill, and even adding original sound effects and Jeff Steitzer's iconic announcer lines. It's delightful, evocative of the source material, and legitimately fun. I played some CTF and Slayer with bots on Ghost Town (the former works by turning the hostage into a flag) and m…",

When Cain says old games, he means old games. We're not talking about his work on the first Fallout here, which is already more than a quarter of a century old. Instead, Cain said we should hearken back to games from the '80s, when he started working in the games industry as a teen. Computer hardware in the '80s was, obviously, less capable. And crucially, Cain said, there were no shared hardware and software standards, even as \"games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles.\" Game…",

It's reached the point where even developer Larian Studios seems a little baffled by the whole thing. A quick recap: Baldur's Gate 3 ran the board on Game of the Year Awards in 2023, taking the big crown (and numerous other laurels) in the Steam Awards, The Game Awards, and the Golden Joysticks. It then continued to rumble in 2024, taking five trophies including Best Game and the Player's Choice awards at the 2024 BAFTAs and four more—including, again, Game of the Year—at the Gayming Awards. It got to the point where Larian boss Swen Vincke was almost asking the world to please stop giving us awards , because the seemingly endless stream of accolades meant the development team \"can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.\" And then a month after that Baldur's Gate 3 won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Game or Interactive Work, because sure, why not. But now it's 2025 and surely Larian must be due for a break,…",

The asset in question is a 3D model of plastic explosive that appears in the new trailer. Recognising the asset, McFarlane took to social media to address the issue: \"Hey Delta Force, thank you for being huge Rust fans. Please remove our assets,\" McFarlane posted on X (via Insider Gaming ). \"If you wanted to collab, you should have reached out.\" In a follow-up post, McFarlane linked to an ArtStation page showing the asset, which he says was made \"fully in-house\" by Facepunch's lead weapon and prop artist Thomas Butters, who also goes by Pilgrim. It looks virtually identical to the asset seen in the trailer, though this doesn't necessarily mean it is the same asset.

As you'd imagine, you'll be rewarded handsomely for taking down a Matriarch, though that's no easy feat. Below, I'll go over how to find a Matriach, the best way to kill them, and all the loot you'll earn for doing so. Arc Raiders Matriarch spawn locations Image 1 of 2 Dam Battlegrounds (Image credit: Embark) Image 2 of 2 Spaceport (Image credit: Embark) Like the Queen during the Harvester event, you'll only encounter the Matriarch during the Matriarch event map condition . You'll know when this is active, as you'll see the modifier before picking a map on the main menu, and again when you load into the match. It's worth noting that the Matriarch event spawns on normal map nodes, not a separate node like the Night Raids and Electromagnetic Storm. Once you're in the match with the event active, you'll need to search the following location for the Matriarch, depending on the map: Dam Battlegrounds: The Breach area of the dam, …",

Well, they said it was a lot of stuff to do with the endings and your choices across the series not mattering that much. I know better, though. In their heart of hearts, in the deep, festering reaches of their collective subconscious, the gamers yearned for the lifts. The first Mass Effect was beloved. It was also a game about standing in a lot of lifts. These things are not unconnected. Now, a doughty modder has restored the third Mass Effect (in its Legendary Edition form) to the pristine condition of its predecessor. Glorious Elevators (LE3) comes from Linkenski, who also put in the work to restore the original setup for ME1's Saren fights to the Legendary Edition and created, ah, Miranda Buttfarts Restored . \"Glorious Elevators return to Mass Effect beyond the first game,\" declares our modder. \"Originally Mass Effect 3 actually had a working elevator right …",

Well, according to the BBC , that's one of the options being offered as part of a pilot scheme in the UK. As part of the project, participants Terrence and Lesley Bridges replaced their gas boiler with the mini data centre in question and claim their bills have dropped from £375 a month (almost $500) to only £40 a month (about $50). The kicker? The data centre, which comprises 500 teeny tiny Raspberry Pi computers, is still compact enough to fit inside their outdoor shed. Terrence Bridges is pleased with the swap, citing both the savings made and the device's impressive heat output… as well as another line of reasoning that personally gives me pause.

So far, we haven't seen any dramatic increases in PC system prices, but as Black Friday 2025 hoves into view, the question is for how much longer will that remain the case? Trendforce recently downgraded its expectations for 2025 from 1.7% growth for the overall PC market to -2.4% shrinkage. For smartphones, Trendforce revised its figures from 0.1% down to -2%. According to Hankyung, memory accounts for 25% of the cost of AI PCs and 18% of the cost of smartphones. Trendforce reportedly expects laptop prices to rise by five to 15% on account of the 75% increase in RAM module prices that we've already seen. Presumably if memory prices go yet higher, retail system prices will follow. Hankyung also notes that the price of 16 Gb DDR5 chips more than doubled to $24.80 per unit in the month to November 18 on DRAMeXchange . In response, bigger players in the IT industry including Asus and Apple are said to be preemptively purchasing DRAM (and also NAND memory for SSDs), while also discontinuing low-margin products.…",

Release date [November 19, 2025] Expect to pay $25/£20 Developer Necrosoft Games Publisher Ysbryd Games Reviewed on Nvidia GeForce RTX3070, AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, 32GB RAM Steam Deck Verified Link Official site Inside me there are two wolves—Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Persona—so it's hard for me to resist howling when ragtag bands of '90s high schoolers kick demon tail in between pop quizzes and making out with each other. The way Demonschool weaves old-school apocalyptic vibes with tactics-based combat brought out the beast. I devoured it in a matter of days, and it pulled off something no other RPG has managed before: make me fall in love with the ways of the isometric grid. Faye is very much your typical spunky, slightly boisterous heroine (hi that's me), a self-proclaimed demon hunter on her way to enroll in a school on the mysterious Hemsk Island (god I wish that was me). Why? Because the apocalypse is coming, of course, and the island promises to be a verifiable hub of demon activity. And I mean, hey, she's right.

    "body": "Overwatch 2 has finally confirmed who Hero 45 is going to be, and the statue in Stadium's Colosseo map was right: the next hero will be a female gladiator called Vendetta who goes by the name of La Lupa, The Wolf. Revealed in the Vendetta hero trailer , La Lupa shows off a couple of cool tricks that'll likely be part of her kit. While fighting a huge omnic in the Colosseo in front of a rowdy crowd, La Lupa uses her giant sword to take it down. She has a spin attack that launches an energy projectile, pierces its husk with a charged-up sword, and performs what looks like an ultimate as she cuts the omnic in half with a huge energy slash. But most of her attacks are melee, meaning this'll likely be her primary attack. Vendetta is unfortunately a DPS hero, which is great for DPS players who want another melee hero to master, but I'm still convinced that she should've been a Tank . Heroes like Junker Queen and Doomfist have already proved that tanks don't necessarily need to be huge or have shields, as long as they can make and hold space, and it seems like La Lupa would be able to do this. But the most interesting aspect of this hero was her brief flashback midway through the reveal …",

That's comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024. If you instead put this quarter up against the previous quarter in 2025, sales of OLED monitors are up 12%, with a grand total of 644,000 units. Trendforce is predicting 2.62 million units, total, for 2025 and over 80% growth versus 2024. For context, another analyst firm, IDC, is forecasting over 130 million overall PC monitor sales of all types for 2025 and around 25 million specifically gaming monitor sales this year. That latter figure is probably the most relevant. Currently, the vast majority of OLED monitors are aimed at gaming, with just a handful of models either engineered for content creation and other professional use or the premium consumer segment. That means OLED is predicted to have roughly 10% of the PC gaming monitor market in 2025. Incidentally, if you're wondering who the big noises in OLED monitors are, according to Trendforce, Asus has taken over the top spot from Samsung, with 21.9% market share in its latest figures.

I'd prefer just to use one mouse for everything, but I've yet to find one that suits all my needs and preferences, all of the time. Most of that comes down to feel and fit. The Viper is great for gaming, but I often prefer to have something more substantial in hand for work, which is where the Pro Click comes in. There isn't a mouse around that's capable of being both whenever I want it to, but the Orbital Pathfinder is certainly on the path to being that mouse, thanks to its wealth of customization options. Which is why we've just added such a category to our best gaming mouse guide , and until something better comes along, the Pathfinder is our top recommendation for the best customizable gaming mouse. Internally, it has everything you'd want from a top-end gaming mouse: fast, accurate sensor; up to 8 kHz polling rate; low weight for speed of movement.

Talking on YouTube channel Adam Savage's Tested, a Valve engineer said , \"Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at, in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home.

To be fair, he's got receipts. Navok summons the recent examples of Arc Raiders and the Roblox game Steal a Brainrot to back up his points. Arc Raiders, of course, makes prominent use of AI voices, which did little to stop it peaking at 480,000 concurrent players last weekend. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, \"had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents,\" says Navok, \"and is named after/based on AI slop characters.

The post also says that \"recipients can use their Epic Rewards balance to redeem gifts\"—an odd phrasing that makes it sound like you'll need to use Reward points to redeem a gift you've been given. However, in the longer Gift FAQ, Epic clarifies that \"you can use your Epic Rewards balance toward a gift purchase\" which makes a lot more sense. As for what you can gift friends on Epic, the answer is most items on the store, but not everything. The exceptions are free games (for obvious reasons) pre-purchase offers, subscriptions, and in-game currency or other consumable items. Anyone who receives a gift on Epic has 14 days to claim it, somewhat shorter than the 30 days allowed by Steam.
