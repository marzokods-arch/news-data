With the launch set for next month, it is almost confirmed that Samsung will use the same specs as last year. While it was previously exploring a display upgrade for the Galaxy S26 Plus, the plans were dropped due to a shortage of time. The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, will come with a new display with privacy features. Samsung has seemingly chosen late February for the official unveiling of the Galaxy S26 series. However, if you’ve been tracking the leaks, you would know that there’s barely anything to wait with bated breath, especially for the non-Ultra models. Among the three, the Galaxy S26 Plus gets the fewest upgrades in specifications , to the point you would probably not be able to distinguish it from the Galaxy S25 Plus just by looking at it. This surmise has now been validated by industry sources, which shared updates about the Galaxy S26 Plus’ mass production. According to sources cited by Korea’s The Elec , the Galaxy S26 Plus is set to go into production with the same 6.66-inch screen as the S25 Plus.",

Google’s Android team spent a significant chunk of 2025 overhauling various system apps with the more modern Material 3 Expressive UI. One of the apps that received a refresh was Google Clock , which introduced extensive changes, including prominent fonts, larger buttons, and more vibrant background colors. But with this revamp, Google also changes a key alarm functionality, replacing its snooze and dismiss sliders with buttons. However, the option to use a slider may be returning soon. Instead of just bringing the option back, Google may also revamp it by giving users the option to choose between the slider and the buttons.",

While patents don’t always lead to real products, it’s good to see that Google is exploring more repair-friendly hardware designs. Google has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) outlining a new way to design batteries inside phones and other devices so that they can be removed or replaced more easily and safely. The new battery design is even more impressive because it doesn’t sacrifice the slim, sealed build that modern, premium smartphones and tablets are known for.",

    "body": "TL;DR Amazon is launching its Fig colorway for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft on January 28, 2026. The new finish applies to the front-lit Colorsoft model, available in 32GB and 64GB configurations. This is a design update only, with no changes to hardware, specs, or features. Good news for anyone who wants a Kindle Scribe Colorsoft that’s a little more colorful. Amazon’s largest note-taking e-reader will soon be available in Fig, a warm berry-toned color that lands somewhere between plum and deep cranberry. It’s a fairly refined colorway that offers a little more personality than the standard Graphite without being overly bold. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft first debuted in the US on December 10, 2025, introducing Amazon’s latest generation of the Scribe lineup with an 11-inch color E Ink display, adjustable front light, and improved performance. Since launch, the Colorsoft model has been available in a single utilitarian gray (Graphite) from Amazon and major retailers.",

A very public incident involving the Samsung Galaxy Ring saw a user sent to hospital after the ring swelled on his finger while he was about to board a flight. It was an unusual case, but it was hard to ignore, and it inevitably made people wonder how safe these tiny wearables really are. As such, we polled our readers to find out how much this scare might have changed their minds on smart rings. Samsung recently wrapped up its investigation into what actually went wrong, and we included the poll in the article covering that news. As a reminder, Samsung concluded that the battery alone didn’t cause the swelling, but rather a crack in the ring’s internal molding. According to the company, both its own analysis and a separate review by an independent agency reached the same conclusion, and there’s no broader battery safety issue to worry about.",

    "body": "TL;DR YouTube viewers have noticed that connections from Albania don’t appear to be served advertisements. As a result, connecting to YouTube through a VPN with an Albanian endpoint can be an alternative to paying for Premium to get ad-free content. This method has its own expenses involved, could be risky, and isn’t guaranteed to last. YouTube Premium — even paying full price for it — is easily one of the best values in streaming around. The sheer volume of content available is impossible for anyone else to touch, ranging from the briefest Shorts to satisfy our decimated attention spans, to award-winning, feature-length films. But despite there being very good reason to pony up for that ad-free YouTube Premium experience , some viewers are dead-set on not paying YouTube one extra penny. If that’s the camp you fall into, you’re going to want to know about this VPN hack. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Instead of stuffing everything into the model, Gemini selectively surfaces only the most relevant info when needed. The feature is now live for US Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, with plans to expand further. Google is finally tackling a common frustration with AI assistants: their tendency to forget personal details. Starting today, Gemini is getting a memory upgrade called Personal Intelligence. This new feature lets the AI access your Google apps, like your emails and photos, so it can give answers that feel much more relevant to you. This new feature is now rolling out in beta. Instead of making you jump between Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube, Gemini can now bring all that information together.

According to leaker Ice Universe, Samsung has also updated the kernel in the recent One UI 8.5 beta builds. With the specified “CZAA” build, which is likely leaked or unreleased, the Galaxy S25 Ultra jumps from Linux kernel version 6.6.77 to 6.6.98. According to the leaker, that’s a jump of more than 21 Linux kernel versions and could lead to a noticeable difference in the interface’s fluidity when the build is released broadly.",

The Galaxy S26 series has been one of the most confusing upcoming launches. We’ve witnessed several inconsistencies in the rumors and leaks about the lineup as we’ve moved closer to the launch, and it hasn’t stopped, even with just a few weeks left until the launch. Today, we’re looking at a fresh rumor about the Galaxy S26’s power ratings, and it might be great news if it’s true. A new rumor now contradicts the existing buzz around Galaxy S26’s charging speeds. Although a report from September quashed any hopes around Samsung upgrading charging speeds on the base Galaxy S26, tipster Ahmed Qwaider now says otherwise.",

    "body": "Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority TL;DR Google Photos is preparing a new battery-preserving feature that will limit frequent backups. We’ve discovered a new “Optimize backup for battery life” setting in the app. When enabled, this setting changes how Google Photos behaves in the background, allowing it to back up less often when you’re not actively using the app. For years, backup controls in Google Photos have primarily focused on data usage. Users can choose whether backups happen over mobile data or Wi-Fi, limit uploads on cellular networks, or pause syncing altogether. There has been very little in the way of power-focused controls for Google Photos backups. If the app decides to back up aggressively in the background and that drains your phone’s battery, your only real option today is to turn backups off entirely. That could change very soon.",

Veo understands portrait framing from the start, keeping subjects centered and motion optimized for phone screens. Visual consistency is also improved, reducing jarring shifts in character appearance. Creators have been trying to adapt Google’s Veo model for their needs, but making vertical videos has always been a challenge. This is a big issue now that Shorts, Reels, and TikTok are so popular. With Veo 3.1 , Google is finally catching up, and the main new feature is native vertical output for Ingredients to Video. Google said in a blog post that Veo 3.1 now lets Ingredients to Video create real vertical clips by default, so the model understands portrait framing (9:16) right away. This keeps subjects centered, arranges motion vertically, and makes scenes fit phone screens from the beginning.",

Many of us have spent the last couple years learning that modern AI does some things a whole lot better than others.

They are small, look slick, and have only the essential buttons (along with a couple of very annoying branded streaming ones, but we shall not speak of those) with a D-pad for navigation. For the last five years or so, I’ve been content with these official remotes on my Chromecast with Google TV and my Google TV Streamer. They’re very ergonomic and quite reliable, and the battery lasts a really long time. But I recently got an XGIMI Vibe One projector, and I instantly noticed that it had a more useful remote. Now I wish Google offered that for its official units.",

    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung has removed its egg-hatching mini-game from the Gaming Hub app for its Android devices. The good news is that all the unlockable characters are now available without any extra effort. If you use a Samsung Galaxy device for gaming but have never bothered to use the Gaming Hub ( erstwhile Game Launcher ) app, we can’t exactly blame you. It offers minimal features or enhancements compared to similar gaming tools by Chinese-origin brands, and lacks any special graphics to entice gamers. However, until recently, it did offer an interactive Easter egg that unlocked characters for your profile image as you spent more time playing games on the device. That, unfortunately, is also going away, but there’s a silver lining. Samsung updated its Gaming Hub to version 8.0.00.19 around the end of December, and not many people, aside from some Redditors (via SamMobile ), noticed . With this update, Samsung rolled out the ability to compare your time playing a specific game against other users, with data segmented by the most-played titles, most time spent, etc. Along with this addition, Samsung announced it was removing the Creature Collection…",
