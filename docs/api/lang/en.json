Music attorneys are typically spread thin, taking on a large roster of artists but with little time to service each of them properly.

More artists are releasing songs than ever, and many of them need small legal help here and there to navigate their careers.

Apple launched its Vision Pro over two years ago, and while the company’s mixed-reality headset has had a few bumps along the way, that still represents a big lead it has over anything similar for Android’s ecosystem.

The device will likely see a huge price increase in Europe. Vivo debuted a 200MP telephoto camera last year, and we’ve since seen a host of camera phones with this feature in 2025. Now, realme has announced the GT8 Pro, and it might be the cheapest phone with a 200MP tele camera. The realme GT8 Pro indeed offers a 200MP 3x periscope camera (f/2.6, Isocell HP5, 1/1.56-inch) that supports 6x lossless resolution zoom and 25cm macro focusing. The rest of the camera system consists of a 50MP main camera (1/1.56-inch), a 50MP ultrawide shooter, and a 32MP selfie camera. In a neat touch, you can swap out the rear camera housings. So, if you fancy a circular housing, a square bump, or a robot-like housing, you can screw those on. Realme also said it will offer schematics so you can 3D-print your own housings.",

The change removes the extra tap needed to access your cloud library and improves security by no longer requiring broad gallery permissions. Google Messages makes it easy to share photos and videos from your phone, but accessing your cloud library isn’t as seamless as it could be. Currently, tapping the gallery button opens a media picker showing your most recent locally stored images. To access your Google Photos library, you need to tap the “Folders” button — an extra, slightly inconvenient step. Fortunately, an upcoming Google Messages update will integrate your cloud photos and videos directly into the main media picker, removing that extra step entirely.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding GPU acceleration for graphical Linux apps to Android’s Terminal app, but the feature is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10. This feature relies on Gfxstream, a library that forwards graphics API calls from the guest Linux virtual machine to the host Android device’s GPU for accelerated rendering. Though the feature is live for Pixel 10 users in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3, it’s still buggy and doesn’t yet offer the near-native performance expected. Back in March, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app to Android, which uses virtualization to run full-fledged Linux programs on Android devices. While the initial release only supported command-line apps, Google is addressing that limitation in the upcoming Android 16 QPR2 update. Even though Android 16 QPR2 will add support for graphical desktop Linux apps , they will run poorly on most Android devices. This is because the Linux Terminal app currently relies on a software-based renderer called Lavapipe. Lavapipe uses the device’s CPU for complex calculations and rasterization (the process of converting vector graphics into pixels) — tasks that the device’s GPU can perform much more quickly and efficiently.",

Material 3 Expressive finally landed in full force last month, and based on your feedback, the changes it implements are well appreciated.

    "body": "TL;DR Qualcomm’s powerful new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip unfortunately doesn’t support Android’s new Linux Terminal feature. This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

Colorsoft screens still suit comics and PDFs, but trade sharpness for color. Update: October 20, 2025 (12:25 PM ET): Following the publication of the original article below, Amazon contacted us to highlight an amendment to the FAQ section on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. In response to the question “How is the reading experience different on Kindle Colorsoft than on Kindle Paperwhite?” the answer now reads “The Colorsoft display is distinct from the Paperwhite display, and includes a fully optimized display stack to deliver high quality color reading. The black and white resolution (300ppi) is the same across devices.” It’s an understandable change. While the original intention of the company might have been to honestly outline the optimizations of each device, signposting a different Kindle for reading black and white text could be construed by some as an indication that the Colorsoft is lacking in this regard.

Details are still slim, but it will retail for less than $100. ANBERNIC has put out some very interesting Android gaming handhelds this year, like the PSP Go-inspired RG Slide , but the RG DS takes the cake. In a year that’s largely been defined by expensive dual-screen handhelds like the AYANEO Pocket DS and AYN Thor , this device finally brings the price below $100. A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games. The video shows off gameplay in two 3DS games: Rune Factory 4 and Shovel Knight. The former had some minor audio tearing, but otherwise gameplay seemed smooth.",

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

The update will roll out in batches, bringing the 2021 phone in line with its successors. Fairphone 4 owners have waited a long time for their next big software update, and in return for that patience, they’re getting more than they expected. The company has confirmed that it’s skipping Android 14 entirely and going straight to Android 15 , with the rollout planned for early November. The announcement comes from a Fairphone employee on the company’s Community Forum , who said development has “sped up” enough to make the jump possible. The update will roll out in batches, so don’t worry if it doesn’t appear on your phone right away.",

We’ve seen a lot of One UI 8.5 in recent weeks, stemming from leaked builds that have made their way out ahead of an official beta reportedly starting before the end of the year . Early this morning, a splashy new lock screen media animation from an in-progress One UI 8.5 build surfaced on Twitter. A video shared by Tarun Vats on Twitter demonstrates the new effect on a phone running One UI 8.5. When tapping to skip forward or back, large album art fades from one album to the next, along with a sort of wipe effect that expands from one or two seemingly random spots within the frame.",

LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes .

A Supermoon takes over, the Draconid meteor shower peeks through, and the Orionid meteors sparkle across the night sky. The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because – it’s a supermoon! Illustrated infographic showing the difference (as seen from Earth) between perigee, when a supermoon appears, and apogee, when a micromoon appears. NASA/JPL-Caltech This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with “perigee,” which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptio…",

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
