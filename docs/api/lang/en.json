    "body": "Credit: Stephen Schenck / Android Authority Last week, Google announced its new Home smart speaker , focusing on Gemini integration, 360° audio, and the stereo pairing ability with a Google TV Streamer. From a practical standpoint, though, the first thing I looked at was the power supply of the speaker, and I was immediately disappointed. Once again, Google has gone the DC power plug route for its speaker, eschewing the more universal USB-C format. I’m tired of having to find a spare wall outlet for Google’s speakers, especially when these are marketed as a nice accessory for most rooms in the home. I don’t have a spare wall outlet in every room, and I find it silly that Google has gone for DC barrel power once again.",

One UI 8.5 is destined to be the next big update for Galaxy phones and tablets, and it will be a bigger deal than One UI 8. Leaks suggest that Samsung will reserve most of its newer features and bigger changes for this x.5 release. We have also found out that One UI 8.5 will be based on Android 16 QPR2 , which will also bring all the new QPR features to Samsung’s devices.

    "body": "Drake ’s 43rd No. 1 on Billboard ’s Rhythmic Airplay chart is courtesy of his Central Cee collaboration “Which One,” which lifts 2-1 on the tally dated Oct. 11. With “Which One,” Drake strings together his fourth No. 1 in a row on the list &#8212; all coming in 2025. “Nokia” reigned for two weeks in May, followed by the PARTYNEXTDOOR and Cash Cobain collaboration “Somebody Loves Me” in July for a week and the three-week rule of “What Did I Miss?” beginning in August. That run equals Drake’s longest streak of rulers on Rhythmic Airplay. He previously went four in a row between 2018 and 2019, albeit largely as a featured act on Bad Bunny ’s “MIA” and Meek Mill ’s “Going Bad” and Chris Brown ’s “No Guidance,” followed by a lead-act reign of his own via “Money in the Grave,” featuring Rick Ross . It’s also Drake’s fourth nonconsecutive calendar year with at least four No. 1s, as well as his first with four or more No. 1s as a lead act since 2016. His 43rd No. 1 extends his record for the most Rhythmic Airplay toppers in the chart’s 33-year history.

We expect more manufacturers to follow suit in the near future. Apple made waves with 2020’s iPhone 12, the first major smartphone to ship without an included charging brick. Apple’s public rationale was that USB chargers had become ubiquitous by then, and so no longer including them with every new device could conserve resources and reduce e-waste without causing much inconvenience for consumers. Since then, other major OEMs have done the same — smartphones that do include chargers have become the exception. Now, it looks like we may be in for a similar shift with bundled USB cables. As shared on the Linus Tech Tips subreddit, user Brick_Fish ‘s recently purchased Sony Xperia 10 VII came without a charger or a charging cable. In a photo included with the post, you can see iconography on the back of the phone’s box that spells out these omissions. Sony’s not really a major player in the smartphone space these days, but this seems like the type of trend we should expect to see gain traction over the next c…",

Despite its dominance, it’s looking unlikely that a Snapdragon SoC will make its way to a Google Pixel flagship anytime soon, and my colleague C.

LTE service will gradually degrade, with most of it shut down by 2028 and full deactivation expected by 2035. Starting January 2026, only 5G SA-compatible devices will be allowed for new activations without an exception. Anyone who has been around the block a few times has likely seen what happens when a carrier rolls out a new wireless technology. At first, it coexists with older standards, but over time, those older standards are gradually shut down as their spectrum is re-farmed to keep the network evolving. We’ve already experienced major transitions with the shutdowns of both 2G and 3G. Things are a little different today, as LTE and 5G are quite distinct in theory but often similar in real-world performance.

Over the last few years, this has changed a bit as T-Mobile has become a major leader in 5G and beyond. The truth is that all three major carriers now offer fairly similar features and performance overall, though it ultimately depends on where you live.

I couldn’t afford to buy an iPhone, and its price, padded with hefty import fees, made it a dream I refused to approach. Over the years, I became more fascinated with Android’s customization. A decade and a half later, I consciously stick to Android phones. While my attempts at heavily modding my phones or fiddling with custom ROMs have decreased significantly, there are two things I still actively do: change wallpapers routinely and switch to a new launcher every few weeks or months, actively hopping between multiple awesome launchers on Android .",

Now, it’s trickling down deeper and reaching the Galaxy S22 series , which started to receive its first One UI 8 update. The stable One UI 8 update has arrived for the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra, as highlighted by noted Samsung tipster Tarun Varun on an X post . It weighs in at about 3.2GB and upgrades the Android version to 16. The update is available to a user in Turkey, so a global rollout can be expected to follow soon.",

I’ve already mentioned why Spotify Duo is perfect for my household, and then there’s Spotify Connect, which lets me control music on my PS4 and other devices through my phone. I’ve also grown accustomed to the playlists it generates for me, many of which reliably contain great tracks. However, perhaps the biggest reason I stick with Spotify is its collaborative queue editing feature, Spotify Jam. Our household often listens to music selected spontaneously rather than from a set playlist. So, when my partner wants to add a track to my queue or me to hers, we can join a Jam and start rearranging and adding tracks as we please. Naturally, this feature is a household favorite and a strong reason we rely on Spotify, and recently, the feature got even better.",

A little over a year ago, I argued that prepaid was a better option for many people, and that reluctance to switch was driven by persistent myths .

When you remove some of the most common myths from the equation, what are the real reasons people still don’t switch to prepaid?

We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

    "body": "TL;DR Photos of the Google Pixel “needlefish” have leaked online. Once rumored to be a Pixel 4 family member, the device sported a Snapdragon 855 with an X55 modem and 8GB of RAM. It’s likely the device was merely a tool for Google to evaluate and learn about 5G before more mature hardware was available. The Google Pixel series is notoriously prone to leaks. Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",
