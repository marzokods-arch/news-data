You're not physically held hostage, but the belief that you're trapped becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. That's the crux of Luto, a first-person psychological horror game aesthetically similar to P.T. and narrated by The Stanley Parable's distant cousin. It's confusing, terrifying, cheeky, and touching all at once.

As part of Larian's big Divinity AMA on Reddit , the game's writing director, Adam Smith, revealed how the studio is factoring players' save scumming tendencies into its next game's design. For a quick definition, I think \"save scumming\" is best understood as using a game's save/load feature for anything other than quitting the game and coming back later, or continuing from a game over⁠—no moral judgement here, mind you, just an observation of our tendencies. The incentive to save scum could be argued to be a design failure, or merely a natural function of games as wish fulfillment. We already have to live with our mistakes in real life, why do so in our fantasies?

Occasionally a different mode is introduced with a new map, but those rarely receive much support—League has been focused on refining a single map and mode of play for nearly two decades now. Dota gets a little sillier —okay, a lot sillier —and Heroes of the Storm prioritizes breadth over depth with all sorts of smaller maps, but the average MOBA feels familiar each time you return. Three lanes, kill creeps for gold, buy a consistent number of powerful items, try not to pass out from sheer anger when it all goes wrong. Valve's Deadlock , on the other hand, has spent the last year rocking the boat frequently with no warning or restraint. Where other MOBAs are happy to get a new hero a few times a year with the very occasional dual release , Deadlock shows off six in one go and lets players tear each other apart over, er, voting for, which gets added first.

It's pretty great.\" It's not entirely a surprise: Slavov posted on X that \"we are back\" when Divinity was revealed at The Game Awards in December 2025. Still, it's nice to have official word from the top, and the interest in Slavov's return runs deep enough that the question was asked twice. Larian publishing director Michael Douse fielded the second one, writing, \"Bobby never left. He's cooking.\" (They call him Bobby, you see.) Slavov began working with Larian on Divinity: Original Sin 2 after the unexpected death of Kirill Pokrovsky , the composer on every Divinity game through Original Sin, in 2015. Pokrovsky was well-known and loved among the Larian fan base, but as tough as his act was to follow, Slavov has done an admirab…",

After years of asking for it, Diablo 4 players are finally getting leaderboards—and a new mode to go with them—in its next update. Blizzard calls it The Tower and it's coming in a patch on January 12 as a beta mode that promises to improve over time. It's basically a multi-level dungeon where you slay monsters for a high score, leveraging both speed and power to clear your way to a final boss. Diablo 3 players will recognize this format as an updated version of Greater Rifts, a super endgame mode for players who are pretty much done perfecting their builds. To even the playing field, there are pylons scattered throughout The Tower that give you a big boost in damage when you destroy them. We won't know until it comes out if they're worth playing around, but I think it's Blizzard's way of giving less-than-optimal builds a chance to compete with people who adhere to the meta. Leaderboards have been an important part of action RPGs since Diablo 2. In a genre about becoming a demon-slaying god, it can be fun to see how …",

All very nice, but perhaps the best thing to come out of this is a meeting between Ernő Rubik, the Hungarian architect and inventor of the cube (among many other things), and Alexey Pajitnov, the Russian creator of Tetris. Rubik is a cool customer but you can tell that Pajitnov is absolutely over the moon, filled with boyish excitement at meeting one of his heroes, and pays tribute to the original Rubik's cube in soaring terms. \"Basically, I am so excited about meeting Mr. Rubik today,\" says Pajitnov. \"I would think that this cube is what people don't appreciate in full, because I think that's the symbol of modern civilisation. \"If I would put something as evidence of human civilisation on the outside...on the interstellar space object, that would be one of the ten objects I would definitely put on…",

Our Jeremy has already been keeping an eye on surging PC hardware prices , but this morning presented a more recent example. I just wrote a deal post about the 1 TB version of the Lexar NM790 NVMe SSD which, today, is going for $118. Not terrible, right? Well, that's what I thought until I remembered I had in fact written about the same SSD back in October of last year—when it was only $66. That is a close to 50% price increase in about four months. Even worse, this same drive cost almost $150 within the last month according to Amazon price tracker Camelcamelcamel . The Lexar is far from the most egregious increase I've seen, with higher capacity SSDs more severely affected. For one extreme example, Best Buy is currently asking for over a grand for the 4 TB version of the WD_Black SN850X SSD.

It's something much more mundane: multi-day laptop battery life. AMD's SVP and GM of Client Product Group, Rahul Tikoo, recently took a swing at Panther Lake , and part of the argumentation is that consumers buy chips based on needs, rather than going for a little bit of everything. In this, Tikoo argues that AMD offers the top of the line for gaming, and therefore, gamers will pick AMD. However, as someone who games a lot, I don't actually look for the absolute best gaming performance out of my laptop. I look for 'good enough' gaming, plus solid ergonomics, a decent weight, and most importantly, strong battery life.

Larian obliged, and writing director Adam Smith simply replied , \"Alligator\". Well…uh, that certainly fits the bill. Even if it's a main story spoiler, perhaps a character's final words (that would be an odd choice, I'll admit), good luck getting anything of use from it. With no confirmed release date or even window right now, we'll be waiting a long time before we find out what this clue's all about.

He's so straightforwardly good as to be, well, maybe a little dull, and he even gets outshone by other characters in some of his own big plot scenes—not because of a deficit in his performance, but because of how those scenes were written.

In a Q&A on Reddit , VanOrd wrote in response to a question from a disappointed Wyll-liker that \"I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.\" Alas, it sounds like circumstances conspired to make that difficult, if not impossible, to do. \"We weren't connecting with Wyll's early access recruitment and initial questing,\" writes VanOrd, \"so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid.\" Way back when, before BG3 left early access, Wyll was a different sort of character and even had a different actor, Lanre Malaolu .

Stoakes then replied to Dave Hansen, kernel hacker at Intel, saying, \"We're noticing a lot more LLM slop than we used to. It is becoming more and more of an issue.\" Stoakes argues LLMs have had a negative impact in many areas, \"for which you need only take a cursory glance at the world to observe\". Furthering this point, Stoakes says, \"Thinking LLMs are 'just another tool' is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.\" This is where Torvalds comes into the conversation . He says, \"No. Your position is the silly one. There is *zero* point in talking about AI slop. That's just plain stupid. Why? Because the AI slop people aren't going to document their patches as such. That's such an obvious truism that I don't u…",

Embark Studios hasn't confirmed a roadmap for Arc Raiders yet, but there are some things we're very likely to see, at the very least, before 2027 creeps up on us. (Image credit: Embark Studios) Following on from the last few months, I'd bet that raiders will get to experience new map conditions, weapons, arc mobs, raider decks, and hopefully even some new community events. When it comes to map conditions, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a desert condition sometime in the summer, like the Cold Snap , but in reverse. I'd also like to see something like a Wacky Raid, where the arc behaviour is really weird, the mobs spawn in locations you'd usually not find them in, and the loot makes absolutely no sense for where you'd find it. It sounds fun (and horrifying) finding a leaper wedged into the hallways of Dam Control Tower, although that's likely a pipe dream. But you know what isn't? New mobs. From the beginning, pl…",

That being said, a lack of real competition is the root of complacency, and I for one would like to see Steam continue to improve, especially as it invades the living room with its second and much more promising attempt at the Steam Machine .

There was an immediate and intense reaction as fans wondered what this meant for the studio's future games. Would Divinity be stuffed with AI slop? Would it be built with gen AI trained on artwork of dubious provenance? Eventually, Larian promised a Reddit Q&A session to give players a bit of transparency into the studio, its processes, and how it's using AI. Or how it's not using AI, I guess. As was prophesied, Larian kicked off its Q&A —with Vincke and a load of other studio honchos—earlier today. One key takeaway? Larian's swearing off using gen AI tools in concept art development. \"First off—there is not going to be any gen AI art in Divinity,\" wrote Vincke. \"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration.

For many, the frustration is that many of these new upscaling features can be made to run on RDNA 3 graphics and indeed, community-based hacks have achieved just that , albeit with mixed results.

Speaking with PC World , Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President at AMD and the guy responsible for various driver features, including FSR upscaling technologies, explained that the lack of official support for the latest FSR tech on RDNA 3 basically comes down to the difficulty in delivering a consistent experience.

The video shows how electromagnetic pencils have coils and capacitors near the tip; a test board picks up that frequency and uses a signal amplifier to send that information to a computer. With an oscilloscope, Yukidama measures the frequency of each pencil as it touches the board, and then that frequency as they press harder. Two different pens register two different frequencies.

That means the Core G3 will get the same 12 Xe3-spec graphics cores as the top-spec Panther Lake chips for laptops. However, the leak claims that some concessions have been made to squeeze Panther Lake into the handheld form factor. On the iGPU side, it's said that clock speeds have been reduced from the 2.5 GHz of laptop chips like the Core Ultra X9 388H to 2.3 GHz. No doubt the idea is to reduce power consumption without noticeably impacting frame rates. That slight reduction in clock speed has apparently been enough to have Intel rebrand the iGPU from Intel Arc B390 in the top laptop variants of Panther Lake to Intel Arc B380 for the Intel Core G3 Extreme. As for the CPU of the Panther Lake package, that's had a bit more of a haircut.

However, there was something about the tenor of CES 2026's tidal wave of AI announcements that really got under my skin—namely, many of the exhibitors seem to have forgotten the 'consumer' part of this electronics tradeshow. CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) Catch up with CES 2026 : We're on the ground in sunny Las Vegas covering all the latest announcements from some of the biggest names in tech, including Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Razer, MSI and more. Now, I know it wasn't AI all the way down. There was still plenty of delightful CES weirdness in the form InWin's fresh signature chassis that looks not unlike a futuristic glass egg , as well as yet another rollable laptop concept machine from Lenovo . I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least one questionable consumer doo-dad too, such as Lollipopstar , a lollipop that attempts to turn \"candy into a concert in your mouth.\" No, I will not be elaborating further. But, even setting aside the hours our poor Andy spent locked inside Lenovo's AI sphere of despair , a number of exhibitors at this year's CES focussed on AI. Gigabyte is among the most obvious examp…",

Researcher and developer Jenny Guanni Qu recently looked at the Linux kernel's bug fixes and found tons of them stick around for a very long time. As someone who feels the allure of Linux distributions and occasionally succumbs to it before quickly scarpering back to Windows when confronted with bugs—usually small and irksome ones, but occasionally catastrophic —this information does not help me.

Qu built a tool to filter through Linux kernel changes and used it to filter for every fix since 2005. \"Six hours later, I had 125,183 vulnerability records.\" Looking at these fixes, she found that the average lifetime of a bug, ie, a bug existing and potentially causing problems for users, was 2.1 years over the 20-year time frame.

IGN Poland said it didn't publish anything about it at the time because the information all came from a single source (that's how actual journalism works), but in light of these new rumors it's opted to make the story public. IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games.

In a blog post , Valve announced new Steam APIs and Workshop options that \"let game developers better define past game versions, and allow Workshop mod authors to specify compatibility of their mod versions with game versions.\" For games where developers have allowed and properly configur…",

Fallout itself \"was a big pivot\" for a studio best-known for the fantasy world of the Elder Scrolls, says lead artist Istvan Pely, and meant the studio \"had to prove that we could pull off a totally different genre, the opposite of fantasy.\" Pely was responsible for much of the game's look, and he began by going back to the source. \"It started with the box art,\" recalls Pely. \"The original Fallout 1 box, with the power armour on it, was iconic. To me, that was Fallout. So, that was the first thing, the first asset. The next iconic thing was the Pip-Boy. It's kind of an abstracted thing in the early games. But we wanted it to be an actual, physical device that you wear on your wrist. Then it was the Vault suit…\" Bethesda's take on the Vault suit, incidentally, is a little more straightforward than the original designer intended: Tim Cain recently spoke about how his idea was that the suits would be \"extruded\" from a machine on demand . Either way, Pely definitely succeeded in fleshing …",

I'm a fan of the studio's work in general, and I loved the way SOMA took the aging Amnesia formula and somehow made it better (and so much worse) by dialing back the in-the-moment horror of oh jeez gonna die and injecting a healthy dose of existential nightmares that's left me still occasionally thinking, more than 10 years later, man, what would I do? In light of those good times, I'm very happy to hear that Ontos aims to go even harder on that more cerebral take on horror. \"In your more standard horror game, say the first Amnesia, the focus is to have players survive in a scary environment. The intent is to evoke a very primal sense of fear,\" Frictional Games creative director Thomas Grip told GamesRadar . \"In Ontos, the focus is more cerebral. It is about encountering strange, often very disturbing, situations where the player is tasked with figuring out the best approach. So, where your typical Amnesia-like game has you encountering a stalking monster, Ontos puts you face to face with a man trapped inside a computer made out of rats.\" That \"computer made out of rat…",

This year, prototypes, concepts and artificial intelligence dominated the show, which is not surprising, nor different to last year. Though I have seen a bit of a trend in how people are reacting to this year's show. From the comments on my CES live blog , to those on TikTok, to various threads on Reddit, to our own reaction on team; gamers keep saying similar things. 'Everything is too expensive' is a common response to any announcement from the show. With RAM prices skyrocketing and this being leveraged for price increases elsewhere, there is a sense of existential doom across the entire PC building market. Things aren't that bad—not yet—but it's going to be a bumpy ride for the rest of the year, if not longer, as prices are still on the rise. I've been scrolling through CES coverage on TikTok and YouTube and sticker shock—the gut reaction to finding out a product's high price—is a constant. Then there's AI. It wouldn't be CES without a buzzword and that buzzword has been AI for multiple years. So consider me very-not-surprised that, in 2026, we're still talking abou…",
