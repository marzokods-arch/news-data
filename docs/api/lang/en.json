De La Soul is a New York City group and a Billboard chart topper. The group formed back in 1988 and forged a path forward, armed with unique samples and eccentric lyrics that set the trio up for imminent success. De La Soul came out hot with the release of its debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising , in 1989, an offering that became an immediate classic, so much so that the track &#8220;Me Myself And I&#8221; landed on the Billboard Hot 100, scoring a peak position of 34, and spent 17 weeks on the chart. With all this in mind, it&#8217;s safe to say that De La Soul has a unique legacy, and Levi&#8217;s is here to celebrate it with the launch of a three-piece collection. The collaborative collection dropped Nov. 20 and aims at celebrate the group&#8217;s greatest hits. Each tee retails for $40 and is available to shop right now on the brand&#8217;s website .

Messages won’t be marked as read until you actually click through, ensuring you don’t miss anything important. Previews are starting to arrive now, and should be available everywhere next month. How much time have you spent scrolling around YouTube in your browser, looking for that next clip to watch, without actually clicking anything? Thanks to mouse-over previews, we can keep that up for quite a while, seamlessly jumping from thumbnail to thumbnail, getting a taste for what they offer. When you want a quick sense of what a whole lot of videos are about, there’s probably no better way to do it. And now a very similar tool is coming to… Google Chat ?

The galaxy in question is NGC 2775, which lies 67 million light-years away in the constellation Cancer (the Crab). NGC 2775 sports a smooth, featureless center that is devoid of gas, resembling an elliptical galaxy. It also has a dusty ring with patchy star clusters, like a spiral galaxy. Which is it: spiral or elliptical — or neither? Because we can only view NGC 2775 from one angle, it’s difficult to say for sure. Some researchers classify NGC 2775 as a spiral galaxy because of its feathery ring of stars and dust, while others classify it as a lenticular galaxy. Lenticular galaxies have features common to both spiral and elliptical galaxies. Astronomers aren’t certain of exactly how lenticular galaxies come to be, and they might form in a variety of ways. Lenticular galaxies might be spiral galaxies that merged with other galaxies, or that have mostly run out of star-forming gas and lost their prominent spiral arms. T…",

Besides, my traditional vacuum was doing just fine, even if I did have to grab a mop from my closet afterwards. Then, the Roborock Qrevo CurvX showed up, and it changed my tune. Between its ultra-thin design, powerful suction, and smart features that actually ensure that I don’t have to keep a constant eye on it, it’s pretty much taken over my home cleaning routine.

Since the first crew arrived on Nov. 2, 2000, NASA and its partners have conducted thousands of research investigations and technology demonstrations to advance exploration of the Moon and Mars and benefit life on Earth. Researchers have taken advantage of the unique microgravity environment to conduct experiments impossible to replicate on Earth, transforming research across disciplines. More than 4,000 experiments have pushed the boundaries of science, sparked discoveries, and driven scientific breakthroughs. &#8220;25 years ago, Expedition 1 became the first crew to call the International Space Station home, beginning a period of continuous human presence in space that still continues to this day,” said NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy. “This historic milestone would not have been possible without NASA and its partners, as well as every astronaut and engineer who works to keep the lights on in low Earth orbit.” To celebrate a quarter century of inno…",

If it were up to Apple, I and many others like me might never have seen this day.

Then, that alert slider disappeared. No, not on the OnePlus 15 (yet), but on the OnePlus 10T. The change made exactly nobody happy, so OnePlus brought its slider back. Now, though, it’s gone again, this time from the OnePlus 15 , making it a much more noticeable problem. In its place sits the Plus Key, a multifunctional button with a new AI-powered journal at its disposal, and I don’t like it one bit.",

The tasks would be sorted from earliest to latest deadline. This would join other sorting options like date, title, and custom sorting order. It took a while, but Google Tasks finally gained a deadline feature a few days ago. Now, we’ve discovered that Google could offer another nifty deadline-related feature in Tasks.

More importantly, both models currently on sale deliver far more portability than a wall-mounted behemoth. Aim either at a blank wall, and you’re all set for holiday movie nights. Aurzen EAZZE D1R At an approachable price point, the EAZZE D1R features built-in Roku TV for straightforward streaming without any extra hardware. It also packs 1080p resolution and Dolby Audio, plus auto focus and auto keystone for near-instant setup. Brightness lands at 280 ANSI lumens, which is solid for dark or evening viewing, and projection can stretch from 60 to 150 inches. That range should be more than ample for movies, gaming, or turning your space into an aggressively cozy virtual fireplace. Dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth round out the essentials.

The plane’s landing gear remained down during the entire flight, a common practice for experimental aircraft flying for the first time. Now that the X-59&#8217;s first flight is in the books, the team is focused on preparing for a series of test flights where the aircraft will operate at higher altitudes and supersonic speeds.&nbsp;This test flight phase of NASA&#8217;s Quesst mission will ensure the X-59 meets performance and safety expectations.

He’s plenty of Eufy’s lineup at home, and the E28 is the one he calls a “mopping and deep-clean champ.” Part of the appeal is that the E28 isn’t just another vacuum-and-mop combo. The dock hides a detachable FlexiOne deep cleaner, essentially a portable spot-cleaning unit you can grab for carpets, stairs, and fabric messes the robot can’t reach. It’s an unusual two-in-one setup — the robot handles the whole-home route, and the detachable cleaner takes care of the stubborn stuff.",
