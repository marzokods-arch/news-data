Despite multiple interviews with key Embark personnel in recent days, it's hard to pin down exactly what pieces of Arc Raiders result from what sort of AI. \"Arc Raiders in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,\" design director Virgil Watkins said in an interview with PCGamesN . Studio CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer much the same, saying \"the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI.\" But as soon as you dig past the surface of those broad dismissals, the details grow muddier. The Finals was an early case of AI usage stoking controversy and conversation around the usage of AI tools in game development.

If it's such a daunting thing you need a guide to get through it, why bother at all? Because at its best the Horus Heresy is an achievement in shared-world history-building unlike anything else, and a gripping saga on a scale you couldn't get if multiple authors weren't working together to build a dementedly labyrinthine backstory for toy soldier games. The Horus Heresy is a prequel set 10,000 years before the rest of Warhammer 40,000, telling the story that explains why its dystopian future is so bad. The Imperium of the year 30,000 may not be a great place, but unlike the 41st millennium it contains a spark of hope and the possibility things can change.

When you try to pry open a door in the tutorial, a pair of NPCs will suddenly appear to gun you down, then loot your body while you're incapacitated. But savvy players have figured out that if you drop all your items before that cutscene plays, you can pick them back up off the ground once your character awakens and then finish the rest of the tutorial with your pockets stuffed with goodies. None of the salvage you'll find in the tutorial is particularly important or mega valuable—you'll find much more and better stuff once you start playing the game proper—but why not take the leg up? It takes only a few seconds to pull up your inventory and empty your pockets. To keep all the loot from Arc Raiders' tutorial, make sure to drop it before you open the door in the abandoned pizza restaurant .

Midnight alpha testing started at the beginning of October and brought with it sweeping changes to its combat and classes, as well as an entire player housing system. Blizzard surprised everyone by completely disabling the functionality of the most popular mods that help players fight bosses and track their abilities, prompting some mod makers to cease development of their mods entirely . As a result of Blizzard's move to simplify the game so people don't have to rely on third-party mods, it also went through and reduced the amount of buttons you need to press for its most complicated classes. Unsurprisingly, these changes didn't go over well with everyone, and many high-level players are worried about the state of class design going into the full release. Today, Blizzard announced that the beta for Midnight will begin on November 11, which I'm sure doesn't assuage concerns over the current state of the game. For comparison: The…",

But as Lincoln explained in September, the ability also enables some new, off-label behavior: By grabbing the floor, you can shake your physics-enabled moneymaker at nearby enemies with enough enthusiasm to, in the words of developer Semiwork, \"twerk them to death.\" So that's pretty cool, if you're into that sort of thing.

Arc Raiders has a unique conceit for a PvPvE game that's fundamentally about filling a backpack with valuable stuff: You're a citizen of Spiranza, an underground city founded after humanity was forced underground by the Arc, a brigade of homicidal robots that dropped out of the sky one day. At the time of the game, the Arc have dominated the planet's surface for generations. As a raider, you're one of the few souls bold enough to brave the surface to loot for valuables. Sure, my main concern is finding batteries so I can craft a table that lets me craft scopes so that I can snipe other players, but as I'm foraging for scrap metal just outside the vision cone of a flame-throwing bowling ball, I have wondered who built these freaky little robots.

    "body": "One of the most anticipated games of the year, \"multiplayer extraction adventure\" Arc Raiders is challenging Escape From Tarkov as the extraction shooter du jour . In the words of PC Gamer's Morgan Park, Arc Raiders built up major buzz with a playtest in early 2025 thanks to its potent mix of \"the bones of Escape From Tarkov, the approachability of Gears of War, and the keen architectural eye of Swedish game development.\" It even overshadowed Bungie's long-awaited Marathon. After a few more betas to test the waters, Arc Raiders finally landed on October 30. As PC Gamer's Elie Gould breaks down in our Arc Raiders review-in-progress , PvP is an important element of the game, but may not be as big a focus as you'd expect. You'll spend much of your time hunting for loot and fighting (or avoiding) the Arc robots, making it \"quite different, both in vibes and execution\" than Escape From Tarkov. But Arc Raiders is still a big game with lots to learn: Where and what to loot, how to avoid or take down the Arc bots, the best gear and weapon upgrades, and so on. Below you'll find a collection of all of our Arc Raiders guides meant to give you a fighting chance on the surface where killer bot…",

There are certain spots scattered across each Arc Raiders map where you're more likely to find technological or electrical items like wires and batteries , and chances are, if you search a computer, you'll find what you need. But this isn't always guaranteed, and sometimes you'll raid rooms that have already been sorted through and stripped of valuables. (Image credit: Embark Studios) This happened to me during my first few games in Arc Raiders. I was on the lookout for six wires, but no matter where I searched or what I scrapped, I just couldn't seem to find anything. This is when PC Gamer guides writer Rory Norris and I hatched an ingenious idea. I had a battery that he needed, and he had the wires I needed, so we decided to exchange goods.

The sunny signposting has become a universal language for guiding players through levels, but it's also a regular point of contention in what some consider lazy game design. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi is the latest developer to weigh in on the debate after his own game was targeted for discussion in early 2024. \"I get there is a debate about that: whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't,\" he said in an interview with GamesRadar . \"I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game.\" I mean, yeah, Hamaguchi is largely stating the obvious here. For me at least, it's never about the inclusion of yellow paint itself, but how egregious it is—I took particular umbrage with its slapdash usage in Stellar Blade for example, which is one of the only games I've played where it's actively bugged me.

Among the crowd of iconic Warhammer 40,000 armies—your space marines, orks, tyranids, and more—these bird-like aliens are often overlooked. But I think they're secretly the coolest faction in the game. They've always been unfairly overshadowed. Starting life as a little one-off piece of art in the 1998 Warhammer 40,000 rulebook, their real introduction was in 2001, as a subfaction of the then brand-new T'au Empire. The anime-inspired T'au grabbed attention with their mech suits, drones, and giant railguns, but even back then I was enchanted by the humble Kroot. (Image credit: Games Workshop) Unlike most factions in Warhammer 40,000, the technologically-advanced T'au would rather absorb than destroy—they'll take over your world, but then they'll invite you to join their empire rather than wipe you out. The Kroot are their greatest success story—a seemingly crude and aggressive species that happily joined up and has been reaping the benefits of jolly cooperation ever since. Except… that's not quite what's happening. What motivates the Kroot most of all is food. Not be…",

For instance, giving fan communities the tools they need to run their own local servers. EU initiatives have a lot of stringent requirements before they can get in front of the politicians, including at least 1 million signatures, a minimum number of signatories each from a specific roster of countries, and—more importantly— verified signatures.

    "body": "If you've ever fallen for a scam deployed by an account that looks like one of your friends but isn't, Steam is implementing a new pop-up warning that's intended to flag potential bad actors before they can send you links. In the latest Steam client beta , Valve announced a handful of changes and fixes, like better Xbox 360 controller mapping in Linux kernel 6.17, fixed timeline markers in game recording, and, most importantly, a new change to chat. Now, when you receive a \"potentially malicious\" message, Valve will add a \"suspicious chat warning that will appear at the top of the chat window.\" Given that Steam launched over two decades ago, and there were millions of dollars put into skins in games like Counter-Strike 2 , it's a bit of a surprise we didn't have this already. Players can emulate others through similar profile pictures or usernames, so it's not out of the question to think bad actors could fake credentials to get access to Steam users. A simple pop-up like this is a good idea for flagging potential bad actors, but it also disables links in chat while the pop-up is available. This means you have to acknowledge the suspicious chat warning to get access to links. Phis…",

CEO and founder of 1X Tech Bernt Bornich announced the launch of pre-orders via X on Tuesday, but the price is far from the only thing giving me pause. Slated for a 2026 release, the Neo is pitched as a humanoid robot that will be able to take care of household chores autonomously. However, it looks like the Gamma could only just about put a glass into a dishwasher, so what strides has the Neo made since? Well, it turns out this robot has much to learn; Engadget reports that the Neo will lean heavily on tele-operation at least to begin with. In other words, you're not just welcoming Neo into your home, but potentially the 1X Tech employee piloting it remotely too.

Unlike most extraction shooters, Arc Raiders actually has a full progression system with a skill tree that can soften the blow of a genre often obsessed with loot as the main form of progression—loot that you'll inevitably lose sooner or later. Below, I'll go over all the best perks in the skill trees that you should unlock. Best Arc Raiders skills (Image credit: Embark) There's a total of 45 unique skills in Arc Raiders, most with five upgrade levels, split between three distinct trees: Conditioning, Mobility, and Survival. In general, I'd recommend focusing on any skills that improve stamina efficiency, as it's required for sprinting and evading, and stamina is incredibly limiting early on. As you'd expect, this means you'll want to invest in the Mobility skill tree the most early on , especially as you need to spend points within a tree to unlock perks further in.
