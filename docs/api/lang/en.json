    "body": "Taylor Swift either has too many, or not enough songs. Or simply, not enough spare time. When Swift dropped by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, Dec. 10, the outgoing host asked the pop superstar to name her top five TayTay songs. Tough call, even for Swift. With that quiz, Swift joined the esteemed company of Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. All of them are inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. For Swift, it’s just a matter of time before she gets the Rock Hall call. Swift, however, struggled to complete her task. “This is so much pressure,” she told the Colbert. “You’re already writing five.” Party pooper alert: the “Shake It Off” singer requested a “little time to get back to” Colbert for the definitive list. “Because I don’t have enough, see,” she continued. “I think I require a little bit of time to like, appreciate my work in a way… and it’s constantly changing, right. It’s a little too soon.” Swift was able to select her first choice, “All Too Well,” the 10-minute version, which was released as part of the re-recorded Red (Taylor&#8217;s Version) from November 2021. “I’m really obsessed with The Life of a Showgirl righ…",

Prime minister Anthony Albanese&#8217;s center-left Labor government last year proposed groundbreaking laws that would block under-16s from accessing TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and other services, citing research that shows overexposure to social media can accelerate mental health problems for young people. Those rules passed through parliament in November 2024 , with bipartisan support, and came into effect this Wednesday, Dec. 10. Australia is the first country to embark on this grand, social experiment. No doubt other countries are watching closely. The music industry has been watching closely, too.

The mass of this hot gas is typically about five times higher than the total mass of all the galaxies in galaxy clusters. In addition to these visible components, 80% of the mass of galaxy clusters is supplied by dark matter. These cosmic giants are bellwethers not only for the galaxies, stars and black holes within them, but also for the evolution and growth of the universe itself. It is no surprise then that NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has observed many galaxy clusters over the lifetime of the mission. Chandra’s X-ray vision allows it to see the enormous stockpiles of hot cluster gas, with temperatures as high as 100 million degrees, with exquisite clarity.

If you see it, you are a lucky witness of a sprite, one of the least-understood electrical phenomena in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Sprites occur at some 50 miles (80 kilometers) altitude, high above thunderstorms. They appear moments after a lightning strike – a sudden reddish flash that can take a range of shapes, often combining diffuse plumes and bright, spiny tendrils. Some sprites tend to dance over the storms, turning on and off one after another. Many questions about how and why they form remain unanswered. Sprites are the most frequently observed type of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs); TLEs can take a&nbsp; variety of fanciful shapes &nbsp;with equally fanciful names.
