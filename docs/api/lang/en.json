The twin one-day events mark Rolling Loud’s first shows in Australia since 2019, and the first time the global hip-hop festival brand has expanded to a two-city format in the country. Gunna will headline the two-city run, following Rolling Loud’s earlier confirmation that the rapper would anchor the event. Ken Carson joins him at top billing, extending the Opium-affiliated artist’s growing presence across the festival’s global footprint. Sexyy Red — previously announced — leads the second tier of performers. The 2026 bill includes several major U.S. rap acts across its main stages. Sexyy Red, Tyga, Swae Lee, Lil Tjay, Ski Mask the Slump God, NLE Choppa, Quavo, Ian and rising rapper Osamason are among the international performers scheduled across the weekend.

With Olivia Dean , Yungblud , Lola Young and RAYE all conquering the Billboard charts in the U.S., and Oasis putting on the biggest tour of the year, the return of the art-rock fivepiece after an seven-year absence feels low-key in comparison. There is no new music to plug, simply a run of shows in major European cities, and an unpredictable setlist – this is as understated as an arena-headlining band could ever dream to be. That said, 2025 has still been notable for the group. Earlier this year they reassessed their 2003 album Hail to The Thief and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company for a new production of Hamlet . Elsewhere “Let Down,” an album track from their 1997 opus OK Computer went viral and landed on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time. Their Spotify monthly listener count now tops 44m users, higher than other British rockers such as Oasis, The Rolling Stones and even The Beatles.

The Swedish streaming giant’s share price dropped more than 7% in the two days after it announced the purchase of WhoSampled , an online song samples database, to power a new song credits feature, SongDNA. Investors’ reaction to a relatively small acquisition appears to be part of a larger theme in recent weeks. While Spotify is one of the better-performing music stocks of 2025, it has struggled since the company announced on Sept. 30 that CEO Daniel Ek will step down and assume the role of executive chairman. Ek attempted to assuage investors who might be wary of his departure, saying in an open letter that “very little will change” when Spotify is led by co-CEOs Alex Norström and Gustav Söderström , two longtime Spotify executives. Ek added that he will operate with a European-style approach to the executive chairman position that is “more hands-on than the traditional U.S. model.” Related Spotify Acquires Song Sample Database WhoSampled; Platform to Power Streamer&#8217;s New SongDNA&nbsp;Feature Cristela Alonzo Anno…",
