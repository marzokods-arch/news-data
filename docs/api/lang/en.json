One of the types of content that is driving this phenomenon is game music. Game music is non-verbal content that transcends language barriers and spans genres.

In the latest of NexTone&#8217;s digital distribution business interview series, Billboard JAPAN spoke with Bandai Namco Game Music (BNGM), the music label operated by the Bandai Namco Group. Since launching the label in 2022, Bandai Namco has used NexTone&#8217;s digital distribution service and its copyright management scheme to leverage a wealth of untapped assets—the extensive catalog of game music it has built up over the past roughly 25 years. BNGM&#8217;s mission is to establish the value of this content not simply as mere game background music but as independent music content that goes beyond the bounds of games. We spoke with Norihiro Fukuda, a former record company employee who proposed the launch of Bandai Namco&#8217;s label, and Natsuko Kaneko, who cleared the rights for the label&#8217;s prodigious amount of music from past games.

Since then, he has been a regular on the coveted lists. Most notably, the artist born Michael Torres has earned 16 No. 1 titles on the Latin Airplay chart since “Caramelo,” his feature on Ozuna’s track alongside Karol G, topped the chart for three weeks in August 2020. Though Towers is known for his fiery rap bars and hard-hitting rap songs, his reggaetón tracks and collaborations are what ultimately catapulted his commercial success and virality on social media. “LaLa,” for example, spent two weeks at No. 1 in Sept. 2023 and has garnered more than 10 million video creations on TikTok, at time of publishing.

Reipurth (Planetary Science Institute); Processing: Gladys Kober (NASA/Catholic University of America) This new NASA&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope &nbsp;image captures a jet of gas from a forming star shooting across the dark expanse. The bright pink and green patches running diagonally through the image are HH 80/81, a pair of Herbig-Haro (HH) objects previously observed by Hubble in 1995. The patch to the upper left is part of HH 81, and the bottom streak is part of HH 80. Herbig-Haro objects are bright, glowing regions that occur when jets of ionized gas ejected by a newly forming star collide with slower, previously ejected outflows of gas from that star. HH 80/81’s outflow stretches over 32 light-years, making it the largest protostellar outflow known.&nbsp; Protostars are fed by infalling gas from the surrounding environment, some of which can be seen in residual “accretion disks” orbiting the forming star.&nbsp; Ionized material within these disks can interact with the protostars’ strong magnetic fields, which channel some of the particles toward the pole and outward in the form…",

La temperatura global de la superficie terrestre en 2025 fue un poco más cálida que en 2023 pero, dentro de los márgenes de error, ambos años está prácticamente empatados, según un análisis realizado por científicos de la NASA. Desde que comenzaron los registros en 1880, 2024 sigue siendo el año más caluroso. Las temperaturas globales en 2025 fueron más frías que en 2024, con temperaturas promedio de 1,19° Celsius (2,14° Fahrenheit) por encima del promedio para el período de 1951 a 1980. El análisis del Instituto Goddard de Estudios Espaciales de la NASA incluye datos de la temperatura del aire obtenidos por más de 25.000&nbsp;estaciones meteorológicas en todo el mundo, así como por instrumentos a bordo de barcos y boyas que miden la temperatura de la superficie del mar, y estaciones de investigación en la Antártida. Los datos son analizados utilizando métodos que toman en cuenta la distribución cambiante de las estaciones de medición de temperatura y los efectos del calentamiento urbano que podrían sesgar los cálculos.
