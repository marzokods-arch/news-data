Google TV would run these checks if you haven’t used your remote in a while. The platform would then stop playing the channel if you don’t respond to the prompt. Some streaming services, like Netflix , offer a pop-up to check if you’re still watching a series. This is especially handy if you’ve fallen asleep. Now, we’ve discovered that Google TV itself could get a similar prompt. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

We’ve just spotted early evidence of “Help me write” coming to the Docs Android app. Right now we don’t have much more than the appearance of that name, with the tool not yet functional. Google’s been spending the better part of the past couple years squeezing AI tools into just about every nook and cranny of its apps and services — for better or for worse. Some of those additions feel like absolute upgrades, while others (like Search AI Mode ) are more of an acquired taste. The nice thing for many, though, is that Google’s not forcing us to use them, and that’s especially true for its generative AI tools, like Gmail’s “ Help me write .” If you do find those useful, you may soon have a new option to try out, as a Workspace web feature gets ready to go mobile.

At first glance, though, it’s tough to differentiate between this phone and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. With a similar design, size, and features, it’s as if the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn’t have a reason to exist other than for Google to claim it has a brand new foldable for 2025.

It features noticeable upgrades to the base iPhone 17, a new design for the iPhone 17 Pro, and an all-new iPhone Air that is a joy to hold . If Apple’s current delivery timelines are any indication, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are off to a strong start, making for great upgrades for older iPhone users. Those of us using an Android flagship are unlikely to switch to the iPhone 17 series, partly due to our allegiance to Android. But what if the iPhone 17 series ran Android instead of iOS ? Would you consider picking one up then, instead of a flagship from Samsung or Google? For the sake of this discussion, we’ll presume that the hardware of the iPhone 17 series (and its performance) remains unchanged even when it runs Android. That means users still get access to the Apple A19 and A19 Pro SoCs, which are among the fastest smartphone processors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is here to give it some competition, but if history is any indication, the A17 Pro is likely to maintain its lead.

Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022.

The update appears to have been rolled out quietly, as there’s no official announcement from Google. NotebookLM is one of the best and most practical applications of AI for average users like you and me . Since it only uses the sources you provide, it doesn’t hallucinate like other AI tools, making it ideal for productivity , studies , or even just daily life (we use it for our internal documentation here at Android Authority ). You can ask NotebookLM a question and get a precise answer straight from your documentation. But what if you can’t locate specific documents that you want to add? NotebookLM has a Discover Sources feature that searches the web for you, and it seems Google has quietly added a new option for scouring through your Google Drive as well.

But what if you want to run an Xbox 360 emulator on your Android phone ? There is one project in the pipeline, but enterprising users have tried one extreme solution in recent months. The Winlator and GameHub apps let you run PC games and apps on Android, but a few users have also installed the Xenia emulator for PC via these apps so they can play Xbox 360 games on their phones. In other words, they’re effectively running an emulator inside an emulator.",

It’s been four years since Google launched a new Nest Hub. The most recent one — Nest Hub (2nd Gen) — came out in 2021, and since then, we haven’t seen a true-blue smart display from Google. This is also partially because in 2023, Google launched the Pixel Tablet, which doubles up as a smart home display when docked. However, even when Google introduced its tablet refresh, the company never explicitly said that it’s killing off the Nest hub line. Now, it looks like we may finally have some clarity on the future of Nest Hubs and how Google is thinking about them.",

This change is part of Google’s broader effort to enhance Android’s recently introduced Desktop Mode, making it a more viable PC alternative. The number of Google Chrome alternatives has shot up in the past year thanks to the rise of generative AI, but Chrome remains the top dog in the browser space. While Chrome may fall behind competitors in some areas, its support for new Android features is second to none. Case in point: Google is working on a new feature that makes Chrome work better in Android’s Desktop Mode , which was only recently released as an experimental developer preview.
