As results rolled in throughout the annual broadcast on Saturday (Jan. 25), the Adelaide hip-hop trio’s latest entries pushed them ahead of Eilish on the tally, marking another milestone in the group’s enduring relationship with Australia’s most influential listener-voted chart. Hilltop Hoods have been fixtures of the Hottest 100 since the early 2000s, with songs spanning multiple eras of their career consistently finding favour with triple j voters. Their sustained presence across decades places them among a small group of Australian acts to repeatedly chart in the countdown, reflecting both their crossover appeal and deep-rooted connection to local audiences. Eilish, by contrast, has built her Hottest 100 footprint in a far shorter time frame, racking up entries since her breakout years and becoming one of the most successful international artists in the poll’s recent history. Her run has been emblematic of triple j’s increasingly global scope, particularly as streaming-driven pop and alternative releases have come to dominate recent countdowns. The moment al…",

But in a strongly-worded lawsuit filed Friday (Jan. 23), Hugo accuses Williams — his friend since their Virginia childhoods — of committing a wide range of legal wrongdoing against his former partner. “Williams engaged in self-dealing, concealed material information, and … diverted revenues owed to plaintiff,” writes Hugo’s attorney, Brent J.

Credit: NASA A new NASA study of its Apollo lunar soils clarifies the Moon’s record of meteorite impacts and timing of water delivery. These findings place upper bounds on how much water meteorites could have supplied later in Earth’s history. Research has previously shown that meteorites may have been a significant source of Earth’s water as they bombarded our planet early in the solar system’s development. In a paper published Tuesday in the Proceedings to the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Tony Gargano, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI), both in Houston, used a novel method for analyzing the dusty debris that covers the Moon’s surface called regolith . They learned that even under generous assumptions, meteorite delivery since about four billion years ago could only have supplied a small fraction of Earth’s water.

NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide the deepest-ever view of this zone, revealing stars, planets, and unique objects that resist definition. Based on the input of astronomers from across the globe, the Roman Space Telescope will spend three-quarters of its five-year primary mission conducting three revolutionary surveys of unprecedented scale. Their combined results will transform all areas of astronomy and answer longstanding questions about dark matter, dark energy, and planets outside of our solar system, called exoplanets. That last theme will be addressed by the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey, which will peer into the center of our galaxy to study the stars and exoplanets that make up the densely populated region around the center of the Milky Way, known as the galactic bulge. This infographic describes the Galactic Bulge Time-Domain Survey that will be conducted by NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
