    "body": "Credit: Tushar Mehta / Android Authority TL;DR Spotify’s long-awaited lossless audio tier is now gradually rolling out to Premium subscribers. The feature, simply called Lossless, streams in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC. It is recommended to stream lossless music on Wi-Fi using either wired headphones or speakers on a non-Bluetooth connection. Spotify announced its “HiFi” lossless tier in February 2021, but the feature never arrived — until now. Literally years after the first announcement, Spotify is finally rolling out Lossless on Spotify Premium. Spotify says Premium subscribers will receive a notification within the app once Lossless becomes available to them. With Lossless, Premium subscribers can now stream tracks in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC, unlocking greater detail across nearly every song available on Spotify.",

    "summary": "Instead of dragging and dropping tiles in the Quick Settings panel, you can double tap to quickly reposition them.",
    "body": "TL;DR A hidden feature in Android 16 QPR1 offers a new, faster way to reorganize your Quick Settings tiles. Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

Preorders are available now for $159, with global availability beginning September 23, 2025 Reddit users spotted it weeks ago , but now it’s official: Kobo is adding a white version of its fan-favorite Clara Colour e-reader. The launch doesn’t change any internals, but it does give shoppers a fresh option heading into the holiday season. The Kobo Clara Colour first debuted last year in black, alongside the larger Kobo Libra Colour . Both introduced E Ink Kaleido 3 screens to Kobo’s lineup, letting readers highlight text in multiple hues and adding subtle color to comics and illustrated titles. However, only the Libra was available in a white and black build, while the Clara was limited to black. For months, shoppers have been vocal about wanting to see the smaller device in a white variant like its sibling. In a classic case of ask and you shall receive, Kobo has delivered the requested makeover and now offers a white model to those looking for a brighter aesthetic on their nightstand.",

Spotify Connect is a lifesaver if you have multiple devices, whereas YouTube Music being bundled in YouTube Premium works out in its favor. Both services have been trying to convert more of their free users into becoming paid customers, and now it seems YouTube Music is borrowing a leaf out of Spotify’s book by paywalling the lyrics feature.

Google broke into the top 5 in the first half of this year, thanks to a highly successful Pixel 9 series. Apple still leads the pack by a mile, with Samsung claiming second place. Google is definitely doing something right because Pixels are back in the top 5 global premium smartphone rankings (devices that cost above $600), with a highly impressive 105% growth year over year. According to Counterpoint Research , Google’s flagships shot up in popularity, driven by the success of the Pixel 9 series, the company’s expansion into new markets, and its strategy of positioning the phones as AI-first devices. Sales for Pixels doubled last year, indicating that consumer confidence in the brand and its phones is growing at a healthy pace. It’ll be interesting to see how much further the Pixel 10 lineup can push Google’s market share in the second half of this year.",

That’s hardly surprising, the landscape has changed quite rapidly in the last twelve months. Qualcomm has gone down the custom Arm-based CPU route with the Snapdragon 8 Elite , resulting in fewer high-profile flagships using Arm IP this year. At the same time, Google has moved to Imagination Technologies for graphics, while the rapid advancement of AI has thrown a spanner in traditional performance metrics. Arm’s latest announcement moves to address at least some of these challenges.",

This new horizontal slider will be positioned at the top-center of the screen, a design choice similar to the one seen on Apple’s iOS. We spotted evidence for this new layout in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1, but it is not yet active. Android’s big Material 3 Expressive redesign brings dramatic changes to the lock screen, status bar, Quick Settings, and notifications, but it also introduces subtle tweaks to other UI elements. The volume slider, for instance, saw several small updates: the dot at the top was replaced with a stream icon, the bar became less rounded, the menu icon morphs into a waveform when music is playing, and a slight bounce effect was added when the bar hits the top or bottom. It seems Google isn’t done modifying Android’s volume slider, though, as we’ve spotted evidence the company is working on a new layout that could bring it more in line with its counterpart on iOS.

    "body": "Pixel 9 Credit: C. Scott Brown / Android Authority TL;DR US Mobile is relaunching its Pixel 9 deal starting today at 5 PM EST. The phone costs $299 with an annual plan or $339 with a monthly plan, and the Pixel 9 devices are fully unlocked. To qualify, you need at least 30 days of US Mobile service (or an annual plan), but there is no commitment beyond that. Earlier this summer, US Mobile offered the Pixel 9 for just $249 in fully unlocked form, as long as you signed up for an unlimited plan. If you missed out, there’s one more chance to score it at nearly the same price. The catch? The offer goes live tonight at 5 PM EST and will likely sell out fast, as US Mobile has made it clear there is limited stock and there won’t be another opportunity again. In fact, the last time the offer was gone within about an hour. This time, you’ve got two options. Sign up for an annual plan and get the Pixel 9 for $299, or pay $339 with a monthly plan (whether you’re new or existing). These are fully unlocked devices, not carrier-locked, but you’ll need at least one month of service—or a yearly plan for the lowest price.",

The approach is not wrong, but an AI assistant can do much more than run a simple one-off search query for you. Google appears to be testing a new feature within Gemini that encourages users to ask follow-up questions and keep the conversation going by giving them prompts on what they could ask further.

Weibo user Mobile phone industry giant (h/t: NotebookCheck ) shared real-world photos that apparently show the Xiaomi 16 Pro Max. It’s unclear if they were the actual source of these images, though. In any event, the first image purportedly shows the phone being used in a case. The case has a huge cutout for two left-aligned rear cameras and a seemingly blank panel on the right.

Do you really want me to click on an article with an AI-generated rendering of two fantasy phones posing as breaking news, Google? I’m genuinely not so sure anymore.",

Pricing on the G3 Gen 3 model starts at $239, with the 8 Elite model starting at $269. The AYN Odin 3, which also has an 8 Elite and launches tomorrow, starts at $299. They say competition is good for the consumer, and never has that been felt more by the Android gaming handheld community than in the past few weeks. First, AYANEO and AYN released competing dual-screen clamshells in the same week, with the AYN Thor coming in slightly cheaper. Now, AYANEO has flipped the tables. In a product sharing session this morning, AYANEO announced pricing on its upcoming KONKR Pocket FIT handheld. The standard model, which has a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, will start at $239 for the 8+128GB model. The Pocket FIT Elite, which was finally confirmed to have a Snapdragon 8 Elite, will start at $269 for the same configuration.",

    "body": "I’m your average techie millennial who saw the dotcom bubble burst and was around when many of the OG services of the internet era simply vanished. Let’s just say, watching favorites like GeoCities and Launchcast go bust was a big motivation for me to start self-hosting my most-used services as soon as I was able to. Initially, it was mostly curiosity and tinkering. That changed over time. Today, self-hosting for me is equal parts habit, convenience, and once-in-a-while stubbornness to stick with open-source solutions. But first, what the heck is self-hosting and how is it any different from running an app on your computer? Honestly, it’s not all that different. Broadly speaking, self-hosting is all about replacing software that is traditionally associated with cloud-hosted tools with applications and services that run on your local hardware. It sounds complicated, and at first it is, but over the years you come to appreciate the freedom it gives alongside the occasional headaches it might bring. Take the bitter with the better, eh?",

And maybe they’re also intrigued by the flexibility of being able to set things up at a moment’s notice wherever there’s a blank wall. But then the reality of the tech quickly sets in. For all the promise they offer, projectors have been plagued since day one by compromise after compromise — they may deliver big-screen thrills, but at what cost? Maybe you’ve been let down by poor brightness, resulting in a washed-out picture, or distracting rainbow effects from the way they cycle colors. But the good news is that things have been getting a lot, LOT better, and even as a long-time skeptic, I found myself getting on board a couple years ago, as the positives finally started outweighing the negatives.",
