And, in a new twist this time around, rather than the coaches dividing up their teams into pairs for the Battle rounds, this time the singers were the ones choosing their partners, though the coaches retained the power to choose what song they will sing. That made for some interesting watching for the mentors who joined the fray last night, including Lizzo lending her expertise to Team Snoop Dogg, Lewis Capaldi joining Team Niall Horan , former coach Kelsea Ballerini returning to work with Team Michael Bublé and another veteran coach, Nick Jonas , throwing in with Team Reba McEntire.

Despite the Monday blues wafting through the halls of the arena, the mere sight of him causes a lethargic crowd to erupt into pandemonium. The band’s legion of supporters have shown up in droves to support their masked crusaders, doused in ethereal black cloaks, fishnets, lace, masks, and other Token-esque attire, as if they were wearing their favorite player&#8217;s jersey to an NFL home game. This level of devotion is hardly uncommon for Sleep Token fans, who have spent the better part of five years supporting, deciphering , and succumbing to the anonymous band’s music and shows, which they call “Rituals.” But from the outside, this level of cultish reverence for a rock band in 2025 feels both new and nostalgic, harkening back to the days when such bands ruled the world.

But those artists didn’t reach the summit on their own. Far from it.

Hurt/Caltech-JPL by Kat Troche of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific September 2025 marks ten years since the first direct detection of gravitational waves as predicted by Albert Einstein’s 1916 theory of General Relativity. These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons. While these waves are invisible to the human eye, this animation from NASA’s Science …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
