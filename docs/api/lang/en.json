    "body": "TL;DR Motorola has unveiled the Moto X70 Air, a super-slim smartphone with a thickness of 5.99 mm, powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip. It features a 4,800 mAh battery with 68W wired and 15W wireless charging support. The phone launches in China first, with a global debut expected soon as the Motorola Edge 70. The race to build ultra-thin smartphones is heating up, with brands like Samsung and Apple already pushing the limits through the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air . Now, Motorola has joined the fight with its latest contender: the Moto X70 Air. Officially unveiled in China just weeks after its first teaser, the X70 Air is one of the slimmest phones the company has ever produced. At only 5.99mm thick and weighing about 159g, it blends style with substance, packing a 4,800mAh battery, Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, and triple 50MP cameras into a chassis thinner than most flagships. Although pricing has not been announced, the phone is already listed on Lenovo’s official website , with a global debut expected under the “Motorola Edge 70” name.

    "body": "TL;DR A future update for Google TV may let you program the customizable remote button to open a specific smart home camera feed directly. This would add a new shortcut option to the ‘star’ button, which can currently be set to launch an app, the input switcher, or the full smart home panel. Evidence for this unreleased feature was discovered in the code of the Google TV Ambient Mode app, though it’s not yet live. When you’re relaxing at home watching a show on your Google TV , interruptions are the last thing you want. Still, a package delivery or a strange sound outside can pull your attention away. That’s why the customizable button on select Google TV remotes is so useful, as it can be configured to open the smart home panel , letting you view a camera feed or control other devices. A future update, however, may take this a step further by letting you bypass the panel to launch your preferred camera feed directly. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR The iPhone 18 Pro is reportedly getting a variable aperture main camera, a first for any iPhone. Variable aperture allows cameras to adjust their aperture size dynamically. This enables better low-light performance and sharper focus in good lighting conditions. Apple’s move mirrors an approach pioneered by Samsung in the Galaxy S9 but abandoned afterward, although other Android brands have picked up the baton. The iPhone 17 series has been well-received by customers, and it’s even enough to tempt many Android users into making the switch . Apple has made some meaningful upgrades to the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras, but Android flagships, especially those from Chinese OEMs, show us that there is still room for significant improvement. It seems Apple is now taking a leaf out of Samsung’s book for the iPhone 18 Pro next year, as it could upgrade the primary camera with a key tech that was first introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S9 in 2018!

Many Kobo fans guessed correctly that the use of “little” pointed toward a new accessory, with the leading theory being a remote page turner. Now that it’s official, Tamblyn describes the Kobo Remote as an invitation to “lounge deeper” and read longer. In short, the remote offers users more flexibility in reading position.",

Instead, I decried the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL for leaning too heavily on AI processing. I complained that they wouldn’t treat photos of humans simply because Google wanted to avoid inaccuracies, but it had no problem using a little too much imagination while recreating signs, animals, and buildings. Overall, I dismissed the whole idea as nothing more than a gimmick meant to push AI forward.",

Android TV 14 is over a year old, but this platform update has barely rolled out to the sea of Android TV devices . Still, most consumers have learned to live with their Android TVs as long as the TV can still open their favorite streaming apps, and let them download the occasional new app. However, this also appears to have hit a roadblock, as some users are complaining that they can no longer open the Play Store on their Android TV and Google TV devices.

    "body": "In the biggest change to the upcoming 68th Grammy Awards, the best country album category has been split into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The change marks the first time two country albums will be honored in the country field. The move helps bring the country categories more in line with other genres that had already separated contemporary and traditional albums or performances, including R&amp;B, pop and blues. The switch also highlights the huge umbrella that country music now spans. Americana and folk have their own categories, but the musical lines blur for many people between all the subsets (except bluegrass, which is pretty easy to distinguish), so it’s nice to have another award to honor one of music’s most popular genres. Whether intended or not (and most likely not), this change could bring the contemporary country album category more in line with the album of the year category for the CMA Awards and ACM Awards. Those Nashville-based organizations and voters have leaned more toward mainstream, commercially successful efforts in their nominations than Grammy voters often do.

This was not network-wide, is unrelated to our T-Satellite direct-to-cell offering, and we implemented nationwide Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content.

Making sure your phone is running all its latest software updates is supposed to be how you keep it operating at peak performance, right? After all, fixes and patches are designed to take care of bugs and ensure system stability. That may be the idea, anyway, but every once in a while we hear about an update that inadvertently introduces a few new glitches of its own, and somehow ends up breaking just as much as it fixes.

YouTube’s product lead for Auto-dubbing, Buddhika Kottahachchi, recently detailed the technology behind lip-synced autodubs in a conversation with Digital Trends . Kottahachchi informed the publication that the system makes intricate pixel-level changes to modify the speaker’s mouth, ensuring the dub looks realistic.

Quick Controls can no longer be toggled on via settings after the most recent update, suggesting it could be removed entirely. The feature still works on some display formats with a horizontal taskbar but not vertical ones. Google recently deprecated GameSnacks in Android Auto ‘s beta release track, indicating that the feature may be shut down soon. But that isn’t all that’s going away from Android Auto, as the platform’s Quick Controls feature could be next on the chopping block. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Google’s October update patched a loophole that the app exploited, specifically blocking the “shell” user from calling a restricted internal API. The new fix bypasses this restriction by “laundering” the API call through another component, so the system doesn’t detect it coming from shell. Back in early 2023, a Korean developer released an app called “Pixel IMS” that lets Pixel users enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on any carrier. This app is useful for people who import Pixel phones into certain countries, as Pixels lack VoLTE and VoWiFi support in many of the markets where they aren’t directly sold by Google. However, Google pushed an update last week that patched the loophole the Pixel IMS app used to forcefully enable VoLTE and VoWiFi, breaking the app in the process . Users who depended on the app to enable these crucial calling features were disheartened by Google’s action, but fortunately for them, a new workaround has already been found.

The kit includes a 9.6x zoom teleconverter lens, a magnetic case, a magnetic grip with a shutter button, and a shoulder strap. OPPO is also selling a MagSafe flash and fill light that synergizes with the magnetic case and grip. You can do a whole lot with the camera on your Android flagship , but there’s only so much you can do before you eventually reach the limits of hardware and physics. Phone makers have worked around this by experimenting with camera kits that attach to the phone, instantly giving your phone’s camera a level-up. The upcoming OPPO Find X9 series is one of the many Android flagships set to support a camera kit. Today, OPPO has officially unveiled the Hasselblad-branded kit, which users can purchase to enhance the camera capabilities of their upcoming Find X9 Pro.

Having access to smartphone apps that have no real desktop equivalent is a game-changer, and I’m not just saying that because I write for Android Authority . Unfortunately, Microsoft sunset its Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) experiment earlier this year, which allowed you to run Android apps on Windows 11 . And while Phone Link does still exist, it only allows you to mirror your smartphone’s screen. Moreover, Microsoft still hasn’t enabled screen sharing support for Pixel and the vast majority of other smartphones. So if I want the best of Android on PC, I have to choose between a Chrome OS device or an emulator.",

For Nintendo DS and 3DS fans specifically, it has led to the emergence of Android gaming handhelds armed with not one but two screens .

As with all Pixel phones released over the last couple of years, a big selling point for the Pixel 10 is Gemini. Google’s Tensor G5 chip enables faster and more reliable Gemini interactions on the Pixel 10, and while that’s great, I’d argue that — despite what Google leads you to believe — the Pixel 10 isn’t the best phone for Gemini.",

From consoles and controllers to games and subscriptions, prices are climbing across the board. As someone without an unlimited gaming budget, that means I’m effectively priced out of most new games. I’ve mostly made up for this by revisiting my favorite retro games or snagging PC games on Steam with deep discounts, but recent developments in the Android world have given me new hope.",

Google Calendar packs many features I want in a calendaring app, including direct integration with other Google products and a UI that feels swift and modern.

    "body": "TL;DR The LineageOS team has released LineageOS 23.0, bringing Android 16 to over 100 different devices. This release is based on the initial Android 16 release due to Google’s delay in releasing QPR1’s source code. LineageOS 23.0 includes updated versions of Aperture and Twelve, a new TV launcher, and major foundational improvements for future device support. The golden era of custom Android ROMs may be long over, but plenty of people still install them in 2025. The reasons for doing so vary: some want a more stock-like Android experience, others want to hold on to their existing device a little longer, and many want to repurpose an old device or move away from Google’s services. The most popular option is by far LineageOS , a project that provides a close-to-stock experience with additional features and its own set of apps. Today, the team behind the project released LineageOS 23.0 for over 100 devices, bringing its own flavor of Android 16 to a variety of older models.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions. The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617). Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support. Update, October 14, 2025 (05:20 AM ET): The developer behind the Pixel IMS app has implemented a workaround that enables VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in regions where these features are not supported. Original article, October 11, 2025 (09:00 AM ET): Pixel phones are beloved for their many unique software features , but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices.
