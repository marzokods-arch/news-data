The explosive and unforgettable performance turned into a celebration filled with hits from Dave Grohl&#8217;s rock band&#8217;s 30-year career. On day one, the musical feast — which is celebrating its 15th edition — was filled with 1990s nostalgia but also showcased new talents from genres like indie, soul, electro-pop, and folk. It drew over 78,000 attendees (according to promoter Ocesa) who enjoyed performances by Queens of the Stone Age, Franz Ferdinand, Garbage, Kaiser Chiefs, 4 Non Blondes, Jet, Lucy Dacus, Bad Bad Hats, Debby Friday, and other acts. The audience, demanding yet warm, kept the energy and good vibes throughout the day, which stretched into the early hours of Saturday at the Curva 4, the Formula 1 venue in Mexico City. One of the surprises this year was the performance by veteran band 4 Non Blondes, who won over both old and new fans following the viral trend of the Nicki Minaj mash-up &#8220;Beez in the Trap&#8221; fused with &#8220;What’s Up?&#8221; The new song has been used in hundreds of thous…",
