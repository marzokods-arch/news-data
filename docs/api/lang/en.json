    "body": "Britney Spears shared a pointed message on social media over the weekend, criticizing her family after they appeared to celebrate Christmas together without her. On Sunday (Dec. 28), Spears posted a message to Instagram alongside a photo of a decorated Christmas tree, using sarcasm to address what she described as long-standing hurt tied to her family relationships. “Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can’t fix,” Spears wrote. “To my dear sweet innocent family… so so sorry I was busy this Christmas but I will definitely show up and surprise you soon.” The post appeared to be in response to a festive photo shared earlier in the week by her younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, which showed Jamie Lynn celebrating the holiday with her husband Jamie Watson, daughters Maddie, 17, and Ivey, 7, as well as their mother Lynne Spears and Britney’s son Sean Preston Federline. In a separate line within the same post, Spears directly referenced her niece Ivey, writing, “Hello, beautiful Ivey… I just want to hold you, my love… Godspeed, friends.” According to P…",

For what it’s worth, the TriFold is only being produced in small numbers and is only sold in a few markets. Samsung is reportedly struggling with Galaxy S26 series pricing as well. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is perhaps the most interesting Galaxy phone of the last few years, featuring a dual-folding design that differs from the trailblazing HUAWEI Mate XT . Samsung’s device isn’t cheap at ~$2,440 in Korea, but it sounds like the company might not be making a profit. Korean news outlet The Bell reports that the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold reportedly has a higher production cost than its selling price. In other words, Samsung’s newfangled device is apparently being sold at a loss.",

The phones are (or at least one of them is) slated to arrive with a 9,000 mAh battery. OnePlus has also confirmed the 165Hz refresh rate display and Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The duo is set to launch in China on January 8 and may be exclusive to the market. However, they are rumored to launch globally under the Nord series. OnePlus is moving forward with its new phone series, the OnePlus Turbo , with the first official teaser revealing the design. Earlier today, Li Jie Louis, OnePlus’ president for the Chinese market, shared a series of images on Weibo showcasing the upcoming phone from various angles and in different colors. The teasers also indicate the particular phone will be called OnePlus Turbo 6. Since Turbo is expected to be limited to China, the naming reinforces the likelihood that it will be rebranded as the Nord 6 for a global release. Notably, there are two different phones: the Tubro 6 and another Turbo 6V, the latter of which seems like a stripped-down version of the primary model.",

    "body": "John Lydon has said his former Sex Pistols bandmates did not contact him following the death of his wife, Nora Forster, who died in April 2023 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease. In a recent interview with The Times , Lydon — who performed as Johnny Rotten during his time with the Pistols — said he did not hear from guitarist Steve Jones, bassist Glen Matlock or drummer Paul Cook after Forster’s passing. “I expected some kind of connection when Nora died, but nothing,” Lydon said. Forster was married to Lydon for nearly five decades. In the final years of her life, Lydon served as her full-time carer, frequently speaking publicly about the emotional and physical toll of Alzheimer’s disease and how it reshaped his outlook on life. “All the things I thought were the ultimate agony seem preposterous now,” he said at the time. “It’s shaped me into what I am. I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.” Lydon’s comments arrive amid continued tension between the singer and his former bandmates, who have toured in recent years without him, performing Sex Pistols material with former Gallows frontman Frank Carter as lead singer. The former band member has been openly critical of the de…",

It ranks No. 19 on Billboard ‘s list of music biopics with the highest worldwide grosses. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska . All concerned understood that this project wouldn’t have the same commercial potential as The River , which had spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. (And it didn’t, peaking at No. 3.) But Springsteen has always been an artist, more than just a hitmaker, and this was the album he wanted and needed to make at that time. Here are the highest-grossing biopics of musicians in term…",

Our list is drawn from boxofficemojo.com’s running tally of the 1,000 top-grossing films of all time in terms of worldwide grosses. Both Wicked: for Good and its predecessor, 2024’s Wicked , were adapted from the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked . The first Wicked film opened on Nov. 22, 2024. In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M. Chu, whose hit-studded résumé includes a previous film adaptation of a Broadway musical, the 2021 movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s breakout hit In the Heights .

Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 35-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them.

She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career.

    "body": "Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority 2025 was an eventful year for the Android phone ecosystem. Between the full-blown adoption of silicon-carbon batteries, Qualcomm’s Apple-rivaling Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and more phones with integrated Qi2 magnets, there was a lot to get excited about. Which manufacturers excelled this year and which ones had a bad time, though? Well, I decided to rank major Android brands from worst to best, based on how well their year went. I took into account their products, innovations, software/updates, overall strategies, and more to create this best-to-worst ranking. Disagree with my list? Then post your own in the comments below!",

There are exceptions, of course, with Samsung being the most well-known , but others just get an EMS (Electronics Manufacturing Services) provider that handles assembly. Some even go a step further and partner up with an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) that not only makes their phones but designs them as well, inside and out. Google and Apple don’t go that far. Both design their own phones, and they even design their CPUs. But they don’t make a single phone since neither of them has any factories set up.

I am personally at a point where I wouldn’t side-eye anyone for picking one over the other for whatever reason. The year 2025 has been fantastic for the Android world — there have been so many great phones launched this year that you could go over each one of them, drooling. The newly launched OnePlus 15 comes with such a massive battery (with super-fast charging!) that you could run it for two days straight without topping up in the middle. The Pixels double down on their AI game, and there seems no looking back at this point.",

As convenient as wireless charging can be, it’s proving to be just as much of a headache in terms of compatibility , but without the fast charging times to help justify it. However, whenever I pick a new phone to be my daily driver or recommend a new model to friends and family, I’ve recently started making sure they come with robust wireless charging capabilities. Not because I think this is how everyone should fast charge their handset all the time, but as a backup for the seemingly inevitable day when the phone’s USB-C port starts malfunctioning.",

So when I came across the Beryl AX — a Wi-Fi router claiming to disrupt the status quo on both, price and features — it piqued my interest. The device in question comes from a relatively young manufacturer, GL.iNet, that has mostly built its reputation on compact routers over the past few years. And on paper, it’s quite the disruptor: it can fit in a pocket, has 2.5Gbit Ethernet, uses USB-C for power, and packs more useful software features than routers that cost hundreds of dollars.",

Despite having all the necessary requirements, the recap just doesn’t show up in the app. There are two workarounds to force it, but even those aren’t foolproof. Early in December, Google began the rollout of its Google Photos 2025 recap . Beyond Spotify, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Oura, and other apps, Photos is one of the most personal end-of-year recaps you can get because it highlights the most interesting moments of your own year, and no one else’s. This year, though, the recap didn’t show up for everyone, and many users, like my husband and me, haven’t received it yet. I did find two workarounds, though. Google Photos users have been complaining about the missing recap on Reddit ( 1 , 2 ) and Google’s Support forums ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) for a few weeks. It’s not clear why this recap isn’t showing up for everyone, but several said they saw the pop-up once a few weeks ago, then it suddenly disappeared.

Instead of the Galaxy Z Fold 8, however, Samsung could bring the technology back with the rumored “wide” Fold. Samsung recently started working on the wide foldable to counter the wider-than-usual layout of the iPhone Fold’s inner display. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung trimmed the foldable down to a ridiculously thin profile. In this pursuit, it removed a key component : the digitizer that allowed the S Pen to work on the Fold’s inner screen. That functionality, however, could be restored with an upcoming Samsung foldable other than the Galaxy Z Fold 8. According to a recent rumor by tipster Lanzuk on the Korean microblogging platform Naver, Samsung is working on another book-style foldable that will differ from the usual Galaxy Z Fold design. We’ve already seen rumors about a “wide” Fold , which Samsung is reportedly developing to compete with the more panoramic layout rumored for the iPhone Fold .",

It’s not clear what’s happening to these photos, but a common thread seems to be that the pictures turned up missing after a lingering notification that said photos were being processed in the background.",

    "body": "Credit: Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority TL;DR Total Wireless is introducing postpaid-style free phone promotions and EIP device financing to the prepaid space. The catch is a 24-month repayment agreement tied to bill credits, effectively locking customers in long-term. It’s convenient upfront, but buying a phone outright can still be cheaper and more freeing, if you can afford it. All three major postpaid carriers are known for offering free phone promotions to new customers, so you don’t need to pay for a device up front. In reality, these “free” phones often cost much more in the long run than you would pay if you bought a phone outright and paired it with prepaid service. Still, many people would rather pay more over time than come up with a larger amount all at once. Until now, this practice was mostly unheard of in the prepaid world, but that’s beginning to change with Total Wireless . Not only is the company introducing a free phone offer that works similarly to those from the larger carriers, but it will also now offer comparable device repayment plans.",

That’s just what TCL has been pursuing with its NXTPAPER tech, and now the company is getting ready to introduce its latest tablet based on one of these panels.

Nick Hague has retired from the agency, concluding a distinguished career that included two spaceflight missions, 374 days in space, and multiple spacewalks in support of the International Space Station. Hague continues service in the U.S. Space Force. Hague launched aboard the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft in March 2019 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for his first long-duration mission, serving as a flight engineer during Expeditions 59/60. During this 203-day mission, he conducted three spacewalks to upgrade the station’s power systems and support ongoing maintenance of the orbiting laboratory. Hague also contributed to a wide range of scientific investigations, spanning biology, human physiology, materials science, and technology demonstrations. Hague originally was assigned to fly in 2018 as part of the Soyuz MS-10 crew. The mission experienced a launch anomaly shortly after liftoff, and Hague and his crewmate executed a high-G ballistic abort. The two landed safely and Hague returned to flight status within months, ultimately completing his 2019 mission. He flew again during NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, launching in Se…",

For the last few years, OnePlus has been a steady, driving force in the Android space. Its phones have consistently delivered excellent performance, fast charging, distinctive designs, great software, and strong value. But as 2025 draws to a close, OnePlus is at risk of that all falling apart.",

Last week, we spotted Google working on improving Gemini’s input box , giving it a cleaner and uncluttered look with fewer buttons. The look we managed to surface was clearly a work-in-progress, as the UI elements lacked proper spacing.

The outlet explains that some regions might get the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ main camera instead, which has the same sensor size as the IMX906.

File sharing blog TorrentFreak reports that last week, a judge of the 12th Criminal Court of São Paulo issued a ruling against Nader, imposing a hefty fine for violating Brazil’s copyright laws.",

    "summary": "This one really is just one big tease.",
    "body": "TL;DR Samsung is hosting its CES 2026 “First Look” event on January 4. Ahead of that date, the company has released a teaser video previewing some of its announcements. So far, though, the video only appears to highlight home appliances, and doesn’t seem to include new mobile hardware. Update, December 22, 2025 (2:12 PM ET): Sure enough, those “appliance” vibes we were getting from the teaser video appear to be spot on. Samsung confirms plans to show off new microwaves, ranges, and refrigerators — including some with AI enhancements. On its own, that might not sound particularly noteworthy, but Samsung clarifies that it’s specifically planning to use Gemini for its Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub — and this will be the first time ever Gemini is on a fridge. The company’s also tapping into Gemini for its Bespoke AI Wine Cellar. We look forward to checking out both when Samsung shows them off in Vegas, and will bring you a first-hand look at what Gemini brings to the table here.",
