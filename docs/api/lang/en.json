    "body": "Wicked: For Good has grossed $518.4 million worldwide in its first six weeks at the boxoffice, which puts it at No. 3 on Billboard ’s list of the top-grossing films that are adapted from Broadway musicals. Our list is drawn from boxofficemojo.com’s running tally of the 1,000 top-grossing films of all time in terms of worldwide grosses. Both Wicked: for Good and its predecessor, 2024’s Wicked , were adapted from the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked . The first Wicked film opened on Nov. 22, 2024. In just five weeks, it pulled ahead of Mamma Mia! to become the top-grossing film adapted from a Broadway musical. Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Nominations for the 2026 Oscars will be announced on Thursday Jan. 22. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M. Chu, whose hit-studded résumé includes a previous film adaptation of a Broadway musical, the 2021 movie version of Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s breakout hit In the Heights .

This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 219, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 61-year history. Wallen’s achievement is especially impressive because he has amassed this hefty total of weeks at No. 1 in such a short amount of time. He first topped the chart on Aug. 15, 2020. Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. Male solo artists dominate, as you might expect, though three female solo artists have achieved the feat, as have two groups. (One of those groups is an all-female group.) Only one Black art…",

The Beatles amassed 132 weeks at No. 1 between 1964 and 2001, giving them a comfortable, 34-week lead over Swift, but at the rate she’s going, she may eventually equal or surpass them. Swift is already the top solo artist on our list of acts with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and the top American artist. She first topped the Billboard 200 in November 2008 with Fearless , which went on to win the Grammy for album of the year. A few quick notes: While Elvis Presley ’s feats on the Billboard Hot 100 are shortchanged by the fact that his breakthrough in 1956 pre-dated the launch of&nbsp; Billboard ’s flagship songs chart by more than two years, the Billboard 200 captures Presley’s entire career. His debut album,&nbsp; Elvis Presley , entered the chart at No. 11 in the issue dated March 31, 1956 – which was the chart’s second week.

    "body": "Morrissey has canceled the first concerts of his 2026 touring schedule, calling off two California shows scheduled for early January. The singer was set to perform Friday night (Jan. 3) at Agua Caliente Casinos in Rancho Mirage, California, but the venue’s website now lists the show as postponed indefinitely, with the change reflected on the day of the scheduled performance. According to the venue listing, the decision was made due to “an adverse reaction to a prescription medication,” though no further medical details were provided. A second performance, scheduled for Tuesday (Jan. 6) at the San Diego Civic Theatre, has also been canceled. The venue similarly confirmed the cancellation on its website, with no rescheduled date announced as of publication. Ticket holders for both California shows have been advised by the venues to consult their original points of purchase for refund or exchange information. The developments mark Morrissey’s first confirmed concert cancellations of 2026 and extend a long-running pattern of disrupted live dates in recent years, with multiple tours affected by postponements or cancellations tied to health, scheduling conflicts, or venue-related issues…",

    "body": "This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the galaxy NGC 4388, a member of the Virgo galaxy cluster. ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, S. Veilleux, J. Wang, J. Greene A sideways spiral galaxy shines in this NASA/ESA&nbsp; Hubble Space Telescope &nbsp;image. Located about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo (the Maiden), NGC 4388 is a resident of the Virgo galaxy cluster. This enormous cluster of galaxies contains more than a thousand members and is the nearest large galaxy cluster to the Milky Way. NGC 4388 appears to tilt at an extreme angle relative to our point of view, giving us a nearly edge-on prospect of the galaxy. This perspective reveals a curious feature that wasn’t visible in a&nbsp; previous Hubble image of this galaxy &nbsp;released in 2016: a plume of gas from the galaxy’s nucleus, here seen billowing out from the galaxy’s disk toward the lower-right corner of the image. But where did this outflow come from, and why does it glow? The answer likely lies in the vast stretches of space that separate the galaxies of the Virgo cluster. Though the space between galaxies appears empty, this space is occupied by hot wisps of gas called the intracluster med…",

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",
