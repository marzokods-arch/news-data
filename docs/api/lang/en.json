Beyoncé also shared her own look inside the Grand Prix, posting a video on Instagram that showed her stepping into the passenger seat of a Ferrari supercar before taking a high-speed hot lap with Lewis Hamilton. The clip captured the pair preparing for the run, with Beyoncé captioning it simply: “Give it to Mama.” The visit marked one of the most high-profile celebrity sightings of the weekend, which has evolved into one of the most entertainment-driven stops on the global F1 calendar. Hamilton — long one of F1’s key crossovers into music and fashion culture — was later photographed chatting with both Beyoncé and Jay-Z on the grid.

You know how hard you’ve got to pull to rip those out of my head? Damn, baby.” Kravitz clarified that the moment won’t change his commitment to interacting with audiences during the track, which traditionally sees him step off the stage and into the crowd. “I’m not going to stop coming out there for ‘Let Love Rule’ because that’s our moment together,” he added. “Brisbane, you’re wild. I love you.” Kravitz is midway through his Australian run, which continues Tues., Nov. 25 at Melbourne’s John Cain Arena before heading to Mildura on Nov. 28 and Adelaide on Nov. 29.

The new production presents a symphonic and operatic reimagining of the band’s 1995 double album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and marked a defining moment in the group’s commercial peak. Across the evening, selections including “Tonight, Tonight,” “1979,” and “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” were transformed for a full operatic cast and orchestra. Corgan appeared as a featured vocalist throughout the performance, joined by soprano Sydney Mancasola, mezzo-soprano Zoie Reams, tenor Dominick Valdés Chenes and baritone Edward Parks. The Lyric Opera Orchestra and Chorus performed under conductor James Lowe, who has been one of Corgan’s key collaborators in reworking the score for the stage. In a previous statement, Corgan said the process allowed him to reconsider the album nearly 30 years on. “It is thrilling to collaborate with Lyric head John Mangum, my musical partner James Lowe, and all of the artists at Lyric in reimagining this very special and historic a…",
