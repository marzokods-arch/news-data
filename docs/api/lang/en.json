The blog post goes on to reflect on how inescapable this tidal wave of brain rotting content has been online, quipping, \"People found it annoying, and people ate it up.\" Naturally, such a blog post wouldn't be complete without a brief etymology lesson. Continuing with the not-so-subtle digs at AI-generated content, Merriam-Webster goes on to explain, \"The original sense of the word, in the 1700s, was 'soft mud.' In the 1800s it came to mean 'food waste' (as in 'pig slop'), and then more generally, 'rubbish or 'a product of little or no value.'\" Alongside Slop's dubious headlining honour, the terms 'gerry mander,' ' touch grass ', 'performative', ' tariff ', 'six seven', and 'conclave' also get a moment to shine…",

    "body": "It's been nearly two years since I reviewed the ZSA Moonlander , and it's still a keyboard that I rate very highly. Sure, it's expensive and difficult to get used to, but if you can afford one and commit to its steep learning curve, I reckon it's one of the very best ergonomic keyboards around. So when ZSA offered to send over its Voyager keyboard, along with its new Navigator trackball module, I had high expectations. Essentially, the Voyager is a pared-down Moonlander, with all excess fat trimmed away to leave as minimal a keyboard as possible. \"Laptop-friendly,\" says ZSA's marketing. \"Goes anywhere—on your desk or on the road.\" I certainly can't argue with that because with just 52 keys and a total thickness of just 16 mm (0.62 inches), the Voyager is as whisper-thin as you could want. However, both the thickness and key count result in some notable compromises. For example, there's no wireless connectivity option because batteries would add to the weight, cost, and size of the keyboard. With such few keys, you have to make full use of the Voyager's layer system to access standard options such as function keys. On the plus side, the ZSA Voyager comes with multiple USB cables of…",

In an interview with PC Gamer about the deeper consequences and \"much higher\" level of agency in upcoming RPG Divinity compared to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke didn't hesitate for a moment when asked if they were feeling more or less pressure now. \"It's more. It's more pressure,\" he said. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing,\" Vincke added. Vincke has previously admitted that Larian planned to work on another D&D game following Baldur's Gate 3 ; ultimately the team wasn't excited about spending years working on a sequel and pivoted to a new project, which we now know was Divinity. There will still be similarities between BG3 and Divinity—Larian confirmed it's sticking to turn-based combat—but if you think that means developing its next intricate RPG will be easier, you'd be wrong. Larian was wrong, too. \"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this.' By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything,\" Vincke said. \"We…",

The game first made an appearance during our very own PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct , and last week's Day of the Devs gave us an extended look at one of the songs that'll be in the game, Under the Lights. It feels a little K-Pop Demon Hunters in tone, and I'm definitely interested to see what other tracks People of Note has tucked under its belt. That's partly because Jason Charles Miller—a name you'll most certainly recognise if you're as Final Fantasy 14-brained as I am, vocalist behind tracks like To The Edge and Close in the Distance—is the co-writer behind nine of the songs in People of Note.

We first reviewed the RTX 3060 way back in February 2021 . So, it's had an exceptionally long run of nearly five years. It's thought Nvidia stopped producing the GA106 GPU dies upon which the RTX 3060 is based some time in 2024. But it takes a while for those dies to work their way through the system. \"This Nvidia RTX 3060 series has been sold for a long time. Although Nvidia stopped producing this GPU a while ago, board partners still had remaining inventory on hand,\" Board Channels says. \"Brands such as Colorful, Taiwanese vendors, and Galax mostly cleared their inventory around September or October. After that, only Zotac still had the largest RTX 3060 stock on hand, and it was fully cleared during November. That means genuinely new RTX 3060 cards have now been completely sold through, and from this month the card is said to be officially exiting the marke…",

Amazon should know this well, having turned a bunch of The Rings of Power's second season into a weird rehash of Star Wars with Tom Bombadil as Yoda. And though I didn't hate the second season of The Witcher, it was a shame to lose the twisty structure of the first season's jumbled timeline, which relied on viewers spotting details to untangle which events took place when, and not gain anything nearly as thinky to replace it. So I went into Fallout Season 2 with concerns. For starters, I expected the pre-war flashbacks to become vestigial, hurried past to get on with the modern day story of Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Praise be to the Atom then, that the flashbacks remain central. Barb continues making moral compromises on behalf of her family and Coop keeps finding out about corporate shenanigans that force him to become involved. But usually the reason TV shows disappoint in their second season is, while the first season can focus on introducing the core cast, the second needs to broaden things to keep generating new story.

It's very easy to learn, very hard to master, but it allows you to do fantastic things, which is the most important bit. \"It's going to give you a really good time figuring things out, and how you can chain things to one another and come up with all kinds of shenanigans.\" When asked whether Divinity would be turn-based and have a similar party size to Baldur's Gate 3, Vincke responded in the affirmative. Baldur's Gate 3, as well as both Original Sin games, allow four characters in your active party at any time. So while Vincke didn't provide the exact number, four seems like a sure bet.

    "body": "Welcome to PC Gamer's annual Game of the Year awards. Below you'll find our picks for the best PC games released these last 12 months, along with our overall Game of the Year for 2025. Rather than try to shoehorn our favourite games into a handful of fixed categories, we ask each member of the team to nominate up to six games released this year. Then we tally up the votes, hop into a big, global call, and argue over which games are worthy of an award—as well as picking our Game of the Year itself. Once the games are chosen, we assign award categories based on what quality we think that game specifically excels at. That's why there's a different selection of categories each year. And what a year it's been—full of surprises, some disappointments, and a handful of games that dominated the conversation throughout. Let us know in the comments which games you've loved the most this year. Best Adventure Game Best Adventure Game 2025 – Old Skies (Image credit: Wadjet Eye Games) Fraser Brown, Online Editor: Old Skies is a classic adventure game.

    "body": "Baldur's Gate 3's fully motion captured and voiced dialogue was the clearest sign that the developer had stepped into the big leagues after Divinity: Original Sin 2. The earlier RPG had great writing and voice acting for key dialogue, but it didn't pull you into the performances in the way BG3 would a few years later. Larian knows that's what people now expect from its RPGs, and it's already bringing actors into the studio to work on Divinity . \"We're still casting, but we already have a bunch of actors in,\" studio founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer in an interview after The Game Awards , where Divinity was revealed. Unlike a film that's written first and then shot, Larian's creative process entails capturing its actors' performances as soon as development is out of pre-production. \"This gives you an idea of the ambition,\" he said. \"We built a huge studio in Guilford, with six recording studios in there. The idea is that these are going to be recording nonstop on this game, which gives you an idea of the ambition. It's big, because we want you to have lots and lots and lots of choice. This is a project where recording is almost at the beginning.\" Vincke didn't give even a rough est…",

Beyond simply finding the tunnels, you'll also have to track down the Filtration System down there. Once that's done, you're heading to Blue Gate to find a Purification System in a bunker as well, so this quest is fairly long, necessitating two runs as it does. I'll walk you through all the steps to finish it below. If you don't want to risk gear, this is definitely a good quest for a free loadout , since you don't have to extract anything valuable.

Acer and Asus will join the growing list of companies passing on the cost of surging memory prices to consumers, which is expected to raise the price of both their commercial business hardware and their consumer PCs early in 2026. We previously reported that Lenovo and HP had already warned customers of upcoming price hikes , while Dell will implement price increases of up to 30% as soon as December 17, according to Business Insider . Now, Commercial Times reports that both Acer CEO Jason Chen and Asus co-CEO Samson Hu have expressed that there is an industry-wide consensus that pricing will reflect spiking memory costs (via TrendForce ). Jason Chen told Commercial Times that once upon a time, memory only accounted for between 8% and 10% of the cost of a PC's Bill of Materials (or BOM). Between Q3 and mid-Q4 of 2025, memory prices rose anywhere between 30% and 50%, in turn seeing the overall BOM jump by between 2% to 3%. While that's not a huge increase, Chen explained that some manufacturers may try to balance costs by lowering specs. Fo…",

Arc Raiders, by all accounts a dang successful videogame, uses it for text-to-speech lines. Speaking to PCGamesN , the voice actor for Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion, Neil Newbon (who knows a little bit about voice acting because he's won friggin awards for it ), was very down on AI voiceover, echoing statements both he and his fellow BG3 cast members have made before on the subject: \"Comparatively speaking, the amount of money it costs to do those voice lines compared to the rest of the game's development is peanuts. When a game's successful, I don't really get why [developers] don't go 'well, at the time we couldn't afford to do it—it was too much or too difficult—but now we've been super successful, why don't we go back and actually redo the lines with actors?'

Considering the last thing you want to be doing is searching the swamp while there are other potentially loot-hungry Raiders on the prowl, here's what you need to do. I'd recommend foregoing a free loadout for this one, since a key you might need later drops at the end, and as we know with the Armored Transports quest, losing keys required for missions is a pain. Return to the water intake below the Water Treatment Control building You visited this barrel previously during the Source of Contamination quest (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first step in this quest is pretty simple—you have to head back to the drain just outside and to the north of the Water Treatment Control building.

It was previously thought that bad actors would need to control a much more significant percentage of any LLM's training data to influence its behaviour, but these recent findings suggest it's actually much easier than that. According to Anthropic, \"Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents.\" For those a little lost, 'poisoning' an AI can take a few different forms.

In just a little over three months, it's now sold more than seven million copies, Team Cherry says . And no, for all you pedants out there: That's not just the number of players who've touched Silksong with a Game Pass subscription. \"Millions more\" have played on Xbox Game Pass, according to Team Cherry, which dropped the numbers while revealing that a free Silksong expansion is in the works for next year . \"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected,\" Team Cherry said in the blog linked above. \"Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.

Sammelin spoke to the huge response to Arc Raiders at launch, touching on the unexpected strategies players have adopted, designing each map to evoke a different playstyle, and how pleased he is to see some players adopting a \"talk first\" approach to PvP. We also asked Sammelin if there's any truth to the theories that Embark matches players partially based on their \"niceness.\" In the example our interviewer gave, it would make sense for Embark to match players who clearly preferred pacifist runs with like-minded raiders, especially in solo Q. Sammelin was cagey about the details, but did confirm that player behavior is a factor in matchmaking. Sammelin: \"Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.\" PCG: \"But you can't say anymore?\" …",

A lot of people played through Diablo 4 and wondered what was really wrong with her plan to end the constant fighting between heaven and hell.

Talking to our friends over at GamesRadar , creative director Greg Kasavin seeks to soothe that particular ache: Kasavin uses the example of the Smithy Sprint, which was cut from the game during the Olympus Update . For context, at one point in time Smithy Sprint created a blast after sprinting for one second at the cost of 10 Magick. After the update, it got renamed to Smithy Rush, which instead causes a blast if you dash near a foe on a specific cooldown. Kasavin explains: \"In the particular case of Smithy Sprint, we wanted something simpler and easier to use for one of the main Boons from the god of the forge, though as part of that we moved the general concept of keep-sprinting-for-a-big-blast to be integral to the Black Coat weapon's Aspect of Nyx.

Indeed not, as the MSI MEG X870E Godlike X Edition is probably the most stable, easy-to-use, and feature-rich desktop PC motherboard I have ever tested. The problem is in its name: X Edition. This is a limited release model, created by MSI to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Godlike series of motherboards. Only 1,000 units will be made available, and restricted to Micro Center and Newegg in the US, and Scan in the UK. So the chances of an average PC enthusiast being able to buy one are astonishingly remote, even if you have a wallet capacious enough to afford the Godlike X Edition.

    "body": "In November a beta build of Fallout: New Vegas that is a whole two gigabytes bigger than the release version was uncovered on an Xbox 360 dev kit . It contained locations, textures, and even whole NPCs that were ultimately cut to get the finished game down to a more workable size. But what was too much New Vegas for an Xbox 360 disc is not nearly enough for a heavily modded playthrough on PC, and the Fallout modding community has spent weeks going over the beta with a fine-toothed comb to restore some of the most interesting things that were lost. For starters, there's an NPC who made it to the deck of playing cards in the Collector's Edition, yet was absent from the finished game. Marilyn, the second of Mr. House's securitron lady friends, is even referenced by Veronica in the finished game, so it's a relief to finally have her return. There are actually a few mods bringing Marilyn back, but I went with the straightforward Marilyn Restored for my current loadout. On the subject of Mr. House, the skeevy Steve Buscemi-looking original depiction of the character is also back thanks to Restored Beta Mr House , and if you really want to go all the way his Lucky 38 casino was supposed …",

The announcement has sent a bunch of people back to Larian's last RPG in the Divinity setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2, which has bounced back into the list of most-played games on Steam. At the time of writing it's number 228 in the top 250 and according to Steam Charts it hit a 24-hour peak of 10,898 players, which is almost double last month's peak of 5,930 players. Though the numbers are lower, similar percentages have been checking out the earlier Divinity games, with the original Divinity: Original Sin going from a monthly peak of 941 players to 2,150, while Divinity: Dragon Commander (the result of a strategy game and a dating sim walking into a bar at the same time) went from 14 players to a whole 23.

I'm still working my way through the presentations uploaded to YouTube this year and being delighted by all the playful seriousness and serious playfulness is on display. There's nothing quite like people with impressive degrees getting into the minutiae of fictional universes created to help sell toy soldiers. The Warhammer Conference is an independent event organized by a group of academics who were sick of having their abstracts rejected by more general conferences, and decided to create a place where Warhammer was the only topic. When I asked Dr Nikolas Matovinovic about it (he presented The Fault in Our Star Children: Genestealer Cults and the Interdependence of Lore, Hobby, and Gameplay in Warhammer 40,000 remotely this year), he said, \"This is one of the more diverse and interdisciplinary conferences I have ever attended.\" That broadness of approach is combined wit…",
