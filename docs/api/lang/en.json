The changes include new settings to customize the frame’s thickness, curvature, and color. It also organizes the editor’s options using a cleaner interface. I don’t know about you, but for me, Google Photos is the closest thing to a digital time capsule . I’ve used it to back up my photos longer than any social media app has, and I expect to do so until Google lets the app live. Besides automatically generated memories, you can also revisit memories by creating collages within the Photos app. But if you use the built-in Collage Editor in Photos, you might find it limiting compared to other third-party apps. Thankfully, Google is now testing new features that let you tweak collages to your taste and keep you from having to look for alternatives .

The device features a 7-inch OLED screen, Snapdragon 865, and swappable control modules. Super Early Bird pricing is $199, but it faces stiff competition from the AYN Odin 2 Portal. MANGMI is less than a day away from launching the cheapest 7-inch gaming handheld on the market, the Pocket Max , but the deal just became a little sweeter. Today, the company announced that all Super Early Bird orders will also include a free set of microswitch modules. The modular nature of the MANGMI Pocket Max is one of its most unique and confusing features. The device includes a set of soft membrane modules for the D-pad and buttons in the box, with additional clicky microswitch modules sold separately for $15 (previously $12). The modules can’t be moved to, say, put the D-pad above the sticks, but some gamers are very picky about their inputs.",

Samsung is reportedly collaborating with another company to bring a lightweight version of Stable Diffusion for on-device image generation. The feature is expected to be called EdgeFusion and could generate 512-pixel images in “a few seconds.” AI has now mutated into an integral part of our devices. But brands still use a hybrid AI arrangement, where only part of the processing occurs locally, with most of the lifting done by AI models in cloud infrastructure. On-device AI on phones, for instance, has largely been limited to processing text, while richer media, such as images, are processed online. As expected, the latter approach raises privacy concerns, but Samsung could take a step toward addressing them by bringing on-device image generation to the upcoming Galaxy S26 . According to the information received by the Korean news outlet Seoul Economic Daily , Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chipset will be capable of running text-to-image generation AI models without the internet on the Galaxy S26.

In mid-January, Google announced it collaborated with companies like Shopify, Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Wayfair to create a protocol called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) . This protocol would make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers for purchases. Along with this protocol, Google also revealed that it would integrate a checkout feature into Gemini, allowing you to make online purchases with the AI.

The multiple systems can offer a combined power output of 90kW. As part of its CES 2026 showcase, Anker’s sub-brand SOLIX gave us a preview of its new integrated home backup solution, the SOLIX E10. Following that early look last month, nationwide sales of the E10 platform are opening today. SOLIX says the E10 is the world’s first “smart hybrid whole home backup system.” While the other bits are self-explanatory, hybrid here refers to its ability to run on multiple fuel options. In addition to its support for solar power and a battery-based backup solution , the E10 also supports traditional fuels such as propane, gasoline, and natural gas through the SOLIX Smart Generator 5500, which can be effective in scenarios with prolonged outages and scant sunlight.",

    "body": "Credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority TL;DR Samsung’s rumored Wide Fold may launch in multiple markets, including the US. New evidence from the IMEI database suggests Samsung is preparing a dedicated variant for the US. The finding follows previous reports that Samsung plans to produce a million units of the Wide Fold, higher than any previous special edition foldable. Apple is bringing its first foldable to the market this year, and other brands are taking notes. The iPhone Fold is set to depart from the accepted book-style design and instead opt for a wider layout, similar to the first Pixel Fold or the Microsoft Surface Duo. Even before the launch of the iPhone Fold, many Android manufacturers were exploring new or additional foldables with similarly wide inner displays, and Samsung is among them . In addition to the Galaxy Z Fold 8 this year, Samsung is expected to launch a “Wide” Fold, and new evidence suggests it might be available in multiple markets worldwide, including the US. The assumption is based on a recent listing of a mysterious Samsung foldable , which was spotted on the IMEI database in December 2025. The said entry has now been updated (via SmartPrix ) with…",

One of the biggest advantages of Gemini is its conversational ability . Users can ask questions in natural language and imperfect commands, and Gemini will do its best to return a result. Google built on this advantage by allowing users to attach all sorts of files and media to Gemini to get even better, more personalized answers. Soon, Gemini could allow users to attach a map region to their prompt, opening the door for Gemini to become your personal travel guide.

Gemini could help you place orders online or hail rides without you needing to actively touch the phone. While these may be the initial applications, we could see more, as previewed by Google in its Project Astra demo last year. Google could refer to the functionality as “screen automation.” AI agents are the hottest trend in tech , and the increasing momentum leaves no room for doubting that your mobile devices will soon be controlled by them. Back at I/O 2025, Google demonstrated how it plans to put Gemini in charge of controlling your phone for you. This was dubbed Project Astra and showed Gemini’s capabilities at not just viewing the text and media on your phone, but also scrolling and tapping when needed, basically displaying a spectrum of agentic force in action to help you with simple tasks. While Project Astra is still under development, we’re seeing evidence detailing some of its aspects. NEWSLETTER | Authority Insights --> Authority Insights You're reading an Authority Insights story.

Google Labs and Search Labs have long been used by Google as a way to give users early access to features that aren’t quite finished. With Gemini evolving so quickly, it always felt like only a matter of time before it got the same treatment. Right on cue, Gemini Labs has finally made an appearance, after we spotted signs of it approaching behind the scenes in recent months. As 9to5Google spotted, Google has started surfacing a dedicated Labs section inside the Gemini web app, giving experimental features a clearly marked home instead of mixing them in with everything else. The Labs area lives inside Gemini’s Tools menu and is marked with the familiar Google beaker icon.

Like many people, I like to replace the blue arrow with a car avatar when navigating with Google Maps. It’s just a bit of fun customization because you don’t really need any icon at all — you know that your position is anchored at the bottom-center of the navigation screen. Still, it’s familiar to have my position marked in this fun way, so I can imagine it must have been strange for some users who have recently seen the car icon vanish completely when using Google Maps on Android Auto . The issue popped up in a recent Reddit thread on r/AndroidAuto , where one user described a repeatable bug: if the media player is in full-screen and they switch back to split view, the car icon simply disappears.

There’s a new “Auto-switch to mobile network” toggle that keeps you online when Wi-Fi is weak, but may use more data.

Finding the right balance between a strong connection and a battery that lasts all day has always been tricky for smartphones. For years, Google’s Adaptive Connectivity was a simple switch that worked in the background, but it didn’t explain what it was doing. Now, with the latest Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 update, Pixel phones are getting a more detailed version of that feature. The main change is that instead of a single on/off switch for Adaptive Connectivity, there are now two separate toggles, each with its own purpose. Both are turned on by default, as a Reddit user noticed (via 9to5Google ).",

With AI infiltrating every facet of our digital lives, I wondered: Could Gemini help me find the perfect perfume for my next blind purchase? As it turns out, Gemini knows my nose better than I do.",

T-Mobile also ranked first in consistency and reliability, as per the report. Ookla, the company behind the iconic Speedtest.net, has released fresh insights about the leading carriers in the US based on their network speeds. According to this report, T-Mobile has emerged as the top service provider for the second half of 2025, with the highest download speeds. It repeats this feat after being established as the fastest carrier in the first half of 2025 as well. This report, according to Ookla, is based on speed tests performed by millions of users across the US. According to Ookla’s findings, T-Mobile’s average network speed stood at roughly 260Mbps, while its average 5G speed was nearly 310Mbps. Verizon, on the other hand, only recorded an average top speed of about 130Mbps, less than half of T-Mobile’s.",

The technology could debut on the OPPO Find X10 series and the photography-focused HUAWEI Nova 16 series, scheduled for launch later this year or early next year. A square sensor allows users to take landscape or portrait selfies without physically rotating the phone by cropping into the sensor. One of the most underrated upgrades on the iPhone 17 series is the new 18MP “Center Stage” front camera. While the camera itself is great, the party trick is that it uses a square sensor. This allows users to take selfies in landscape and portrait orientations without physically rotating their phone, as the company crops into the sensor for the shot. Android users could soon join in on the fun, as Android brands have started exploring a square selfie camera for their upcoming phones. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A new report from Dealabs says the launch is set for March 12, 2026, with pre-orders starting around March 5 (via Notebookcheck ). The big news is the expected price: about €159 in Europe and £149 in the UK, which is about half of what the original Headphone 1 cost at launch. This price drop puts Nothing in direct competition with mid-range headphones from brands like JBL and Sony, which is unexpected for a company known for its premium look and pricing.",

    "body": "TL;DR Last year Google started supporting a landscape mode UI for its Phone app. Eventually a new option to lock the app in portrait arrived for beta testers. That setting is now broadly available, as Google addresses confusion surrounding the feature. The software on our phones is constantly being updated, so we’re well aware that the appearance and functionality of apps can change on even a day-to-day basis. But last year, Android users found themselves scratching their heads about one change in particular: Google’s Phone app adding support for a landscape-style interface . Was it a bug? Was it a feature? Who was even asking for this in the first place? After a few bumpy months, it now looks like we’re finally at the end of this weird saga.

    "body": "Credit: Amazon TL;DR Ring’s Search Party for Dogs is now available to anyone in the US through the Ring app, even if you don’t own a Ring camera. Nearby Ring cameras can automatically flag dogs that resemble a missing pet and alert users, who can choose whether to share footage with the dog’s owners. The AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog per day since it launched. Losing your dog is often a panic-inducing event, and you immediately want everyone in the neighbourhood on the lookout. While most of your neighbours would probably like to help, they’re busy with their own lives. Ring is now leaning into that reality by opening up its Search Party for Dogs feature to everyone, whether they own a Ring security camera or not. According to an announcement from the Amazon Newsroom , the AI-powered feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog a day with their owners since its launch, but it was previously limited to Ring camera owners. With this expansion, anyone can now post a missing dog alert through the app and have nearby Ring cameras hunt for it, even if they don’t have any of the brand’s hardware themselves.",
