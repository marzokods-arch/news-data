As announced by Google , the web-based Google Chat interface now has a built-in sticker picker nested alongside the existing GIF picker. Both stickers and GIFs now live behind a sticker icon in Google Chat’s message field.",

In a recent poll , we asked which of a few other apps you prefer — and there’s a clear winner. Given the choice between Bandcamp, Deezer, SoundCloud, Tidal, and YouTube Music, Google’s music app came out ahead by a wide margin. Nearly half of survey respondents preferred YouTube Music — taking out the “other” option, YouTube Music got more votes than all the other options in our survey combined.",

    "body": "TL;DR Leaked builds show Samsung’s next One UI 8.5 update, debuting with the Galaxy S26, will be based on Android 16’s second quarterly release (QPR2). This is significant because most device makers skip quarterly Android updates, delaying new features until the next major annual version is released. By adopting QPR2, Samsung can bring new Android platform features to Galaxy devices much faster than before, matching Google’s own release cadence. We’re still over 3 months away from the expected unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series, but we already know many of its new software tricks thanks to a trove of One UI 8.5 leaks . Leaked builds of the software have surfaced, giving us a rare opportunity to see what Samsung is developing for its next major release. As its name suggests, One UI 8.5 will be based on this year’s Android 16 release, not the yet-to-be-released Android 17 . However, it will differ from its predecessor. While One UI 8 was based on the initial stable release of Android 16, One UI 8.5 will be built upon the second quarterly platform release, Android 16 QPR2.",

Typically, we know everything about the next Pixel phones months before their announcement, but occasionally, the odd rumored device never arrives, leaving us with a mystery. This was the case with the canceled first-gen Pixel Fold, codenamed “pipit,” for example, until we showcased what it was last year. Another of these mysteries is the alleged third flagship Pixel 4 device, codenamed “needlefish.” There were many theories about what it could be, but we had never seen any concrete details, until now. Thanks to a photo leak and our sources, we’ve managed to get to the bottom of what the mysterious handset was.",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority One of the most common complaints I keep reading from YouTube Music users is that Google treats it and their regular YouTube experience as one and the same. If you like one artist’s songs, you’re now subscribed to their videos as well. If you listen to or search for some music, it’s now part of your YouTube recommendations as well. For the few people who solely (or mostly) use YouTube to watch music videos, that’s fine. But most people have more varied interests than just music videos and end up with an odd mix of two experiences that shouldn’t be merged. Me? I don’t watch music videos at all, so seeing any YouTube Music content in my regular YouTube feels like unwanted clutter that I have to weed through. Having my video subscriptions littered with artists and bands led me to cull most of my liked artists on Music, then ditch it altogether for Spotify’s more powerful featureset . Then, one day, I realized I was sitting on the perfect cure for that annoying YouTube overlap: multiple channels.",

Fitness platform Strava is suing hardware maker and one of its biggest partners, Garmin, over alleged patent infringements. Strava also wants Garmin to stop selling products that may utilize these patents, which would include a slew of its fitness watches, cycling computers, and the Garmin Connect app. The lawsuit, first reported by fitness industry veteran DC Rainmaker , focuses on two primary features utilized by both companies: segments and heatmaps. Segments allow users to compete against others and themselves within sections of a given route. Breaking down longer routes encourages users to hit more manageable targets across a more extended training session or race. Heatmaps, meanwhile, display areas and routes that users traffic heavily, effectively highlighting popular training areas. This is an excellent…",

Thanks to a small but significant change, Google is making it much easier to edit Scheduled Actions directly from the Gemini app.",

If they didn’t have enough crime happening around them, eufy encouraged users to film themselves pretending to be package thieves. It’s sometimes difficult to remember, especially when we’re confronted with all the incredibly impressive feats it can pull off, that AI, despite the “intelligence” in its name, is still profoundly dumb. At least, it doesn’t have any real understanding of concepts, and only manages to give the impression that it does because it is so very, very good at matching patterns . Getting that good requires a lot of training, which is one of the biggest expenses faced by the companies building these models. And this week we’re learning about a clever way one company looked to crowdsource an effort like that — even if it cut a few corners along the way.

The new system requires Android to check if a developer is verified, which in some cases will necessitate an active internet connection during installation.

This applies not only to apps on the Play Store but also to apps distributed outside of it, sparking concern that Google wants to kill sideloading . After a few weeks of silence, Google finally addressed these concerns, insisting that sideloading is here to stay.

These actions were previously only possible in the desktop Calendar interface. Early this year, we shared evidence that the Google Calendar app was cooking up new sharing controls , a change that would save users having to use the desktop interface to share calendars with others, as well as to unsubscribe from calendars you no longer want to see. Those changes are now rolling out widely. As of version 2025.38.0-809757839-release of Google Calendar, the app presents options to share individual calendars with other users or groups, right from your phone. The option isn’t terribly obvious, nested under Settings in Google Calendar’s side panel menu. But considering these actions weren’t possible in the app at all up until now, it’s definitely an improvement.",

Instead, users simply need to use a little data each month, with optional rewards available through the Cloud Points program. At the beginning of this year, Helium Mobile introduced a brand new data-only plan that included 3GB of data, 300 texts, and 100 minutes of calling for the impressive price of nothing. Basically, it made up for potentially lost revenue through data collection and other similar measures, not too dissimilar from many websites and online businesses. That said, it did require location sharing to be on at all times, which, for me, was a major turn-off. The good news is that the requirement has finally gone away!

The setup helps dissipate heat from the phone’s frame, reducing heat buildup and thermal throttling. Alongside the move back to aluminum on the iPhone 17 Pro , Apple also began using vapor chamber cooling on its flagships to help users achieve even better sustained performance from the powerful Apple A19 Pro SoC. Vapor chamber cooling isn’t new by any means, and Android flagships have long utilized it to maximize the performance of their SoCs.

The Galaxy S26 Ultra’s design may lack any radical changes, but the display is set to feature a significant upgrade that would make privacy-focused screen protectors obsolete. For the Ultra next year, Samsung is developing a built-in solution to dim the display or hide its contents in specific scenarios, which could represent a significant step forward from the existing anti-glare solution. Last month, we learned about an upcoming Samsung feature, currently referred to as Private Display, which could block peeks from unwanted onlookers , especially at specific angles. What’s truly marvelous is that Privacy Display is integrated electronically, which means it can be toggled on or off, or its intensity set to different levels.

It might be the quietest, but if you live in an area with solid AT&amp;T coverage, there’s little reason to consider one of the other big networks. After all, AT&amp;T customers are seeing price increases, weakening customer service, and other shifts that you’d find with Verizon and T-Mobile as well. That said, there are plenty of great alternatives to AT&amp;T if you are willing to give prepaid a chance.",

The device is priced at $599, with preorders now live and general availability in October. Yet another portable projector is eyeing your ceiling space, this time from BenQ. The new GV32 builds on the momentum of the company’s GV projector series, delivering HDR10 color and flexible projection in tight spaces, but now with an LED light source. BenQ positions the GV32 as a bridge between entry-level LED portables and its more premium laser models. It carries forward the rotating design of its GV siblings, including the much pricier GV50, with a base that supports 135° vertical tilt and full 360° horizontal rotation. For easy setup, it also features auto correction, zoom, and horizontal/vertical keystone adjustments.",
