Tyler, The Creator had a big enough 2024 to end up an honorable mention on our Greatest Pop Stars Honorable Mentions list that year, with his October release Chromakopia landing the best first-week numbers of his career and spawning multiple top 10 Hot 100 hits, including his first long-lasting rap radio hit &#8220;Sticky.&#8221; But rather than spend 2025 basking in the afterglow of that success, Tyler just kept pushing forward last year, with a dancefloor-oriented semi-surprise new album, one of the year&#8217;s biggest tours and even a feature film debut in one of the year&#8217;s biggest movies. This Greatest Pop Stars of 2025 episode of the Greatest Pop Stars podcast looks at how Tyler, The Creator ended up at No. 10 on our list — his first time making the top 10 — thanks to an impressively full year where he really decided to just go for it.

Listen to our Greatest Pop Stars podcast discussion about Tyler&#8217;s first year making our 10 Greatest Pop Stars list here . About 15 years ago, in February 2011, a menacing group of young adults set the internet ablaze with its anarchic musical performance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon . The rabble-rousers of Odd Future took their off-color, Tumblr-coded rap music to network television – and their appearance marked their introduction to the mainstream. But at the time, and for years after, Odd Future&#8217;s ringleader and breakout talent, Tyler, The Creator , seemed an unlikely candidate to ever transcend cult status.

    "body": "Australian indie favourites Lime Cordiale have announced a new climate-focused live music event, unveiling the inaugural Lime Green Festival, a one-day, off-grid festival designed to place environmental action at the centre of the live music experience. Set to take place on April 18 at Point Malcolm Reserve in Semaphore, Adelaide, the festival is being presented in partnership with Chugg Music and supported by the South Australian Government and City of Charles Sturt. According to organisers, Lime Green is being developed as a 100% off-grid event, with the goal of significantly reducing the environmental footprint typically associated with large-scale live music festivals. Lime Cordiale brothers Oli and Louis Leimbach said the project emerged from years of questioning the environmental impact of touring and live events. “From the accelerating loss of polar ice to the devastating algal blooms currently choking the South Australian coast, it is impossible to ignore that our climate is at a breaking point,” the duo said in a statement. “For the last five years, we’ve wrestled with a deep, personal dilemma as environmentalists: Is our touring contributing to the problem? Does it still…",

    "body": "Australian radio station Triple M has unveiled its Most Played Songs countdown, marking 45 years of broadcasting by tallying every track spun across the network since its launch — a data-driven snapshot of Australian radio history measured entirely by airplay. Topping the list is GANGgajang’s “Sounds Of Then (This Is Australia),” which emerged as the most-played song in the station’s history. The track leads a top ten dominated by Australian artists, with six local songs making the cut, including INXS’ “Don’t Change,” Paul Kelly and The Messengers’ “Dumb Things,” AC/DC’s “You Shook Me All Night Long,” Choirboys’ “Run To Paradise,” and The Screaming Jets’ “Better.” International staples also appear near the top, with Van Halen’s “Jump,” Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Lenny Kravitz’s “Are You Gonna Go My Way,” and Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ On A Prayer” rounding out the upper tier of the list. According to Triple M, the countdown differs from traditional listener polls by relying solely on broadcast data rather than voting or audience surveys. “This countdown isn’t a vote. It’s not a popularity contest. And it’s not built for debate. It’s the raw history of Triple M — measured entirely by air…",
