    "body": "Credit: Hadlee Simons / Android Authority TL;DR A developer is building a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, called Marathon OS. This is a Linux-based mobile platform that features BlackBerry 10-inspired features like Active Frames and a Hub inbox. Marathon OS currently runs on the OnePlus 6, with plans to bring it to the OnePlus 6T, POCO F1, and more. BlackBerry 10 may have been a failed rival to Android and iOS, but it was an intriguing and innovative mobile platform in its own right. Now, an enterprising developer has decided to build a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10, and it’ll run on Android phones . Developer Patrick Quinn has announced development of the Marathon OS project , which he claims will be a spiritual successor to BlackBerry 10. Quinn says the platform will include BB10 staples such as the familiar gesture navigation system, a take on the BlackBerry Hub for a unified messaging/notification inbox, and the Active Frames concept. When it comes to the latter, BlackBerry 10 had a home screen that showed currently running apps as card-based windows, and these windows were still able to refresh in real-time. Marathon OS even features the BB10 peek gesture, which …",

Usually, I know how things are going to go: Apple will put up a pretty good fight with solid cameras and excellent optimization, only to come up short in terms of the overall experience. This year, however, I feel like there has been less change from one generation of Android flagship to the next from the two most prominent players in the US. The Galaxy S25 line barely needed to exist, and the Pixel 10 series is the best phone Google has ever made, but it’s not life-changing — it’s still a Pixel, just better.

The Pixel Buds are great, but being the default doesn't make them the best. On the opposite end of the spectrum, odd as it might seem, it’s not rare to find Android users choosing AirPods as their Bluetooth earbuds of choice. Honestly, it’s easy to see why. They’re familiar and sound good enough. The AirPods have built a reputation for consistency and carry a level of brand cachet that alternatives often don’t.

The Living End initially responded with quiet gratitude via Instagram Stories across the weekend, but on Sunday, Cheney delivered with a full-circle flashback. Posting to social media, the Aussie frontman recalled losing a 1992 Battle of the Bands at Wheelers Hill High School to a Metallica cover band named Texas Rose — who beat his then-band Runaway Boys by performing “Enter Sandman.” At the time, Cheney was crushed. “They simply stole the show and won,” he wrote. “The bass player came up t…",

    "body": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority TL;DR North Korean hackers have apparently used Google’s Find Hub to remotely track and wipe victims’ devices. A cybersecurity firm said the hackers initially compromised devices by sending malicious files via KakaoTalk. It’s recommended that you enable two-factor authentication on your Google account and regularly change your password. It’s not uncommon for hackers to turn your favorite apps and services against you, and it turns out cybercriminals are abusing Google Find Hub to remotely track and wipe victims’ Android phones and tablets. Security firm Genians (h/t: Bleeping Computer ) reports that North Korean state-backed hackers were compromising victims’ Android devices by using malicious files sent via the KakaoTalk chat app. The malicious scripts would then lie dormant on a user’s device, while also installing additional scripts to monitor and control the system. This way, the cybercriminals are able to harvest credentials for a variety of accounts and services.",

While Verizon’s rumored meeting this month may talk about employee layoffs, it’s less clear about the intentions for this meeting. The timing may just align with T-Mobile’s usual pre–holiday sales prep, discussing promotions, goals, or new initiatives like the T-Mobile credit card or T-Life rollout. Earlier this week, there were rumors that Verizon might be announcing some big changes later this month, as talks of potential layoffs are in the air. It’s still unclear if there’s any real substance to the claims, but it seems that they aren’t the only carrier with rumored changes ahead. As first reported by Visible-Bonus-9387 via Reddit , it seems T-Mobile stores around the country are set for a big meeting on November 23. According to the employee, it will be about “something big”.

Representing Team Niall, the Mississippi-born singer leaned into the classic 1996 ballad’s rich heritage and signature yodels, aiming to evoke the same impact Rimes had when she first hit the charts at just 13. Clark’s interpretation kept things classic while still highlighting her own vocal colour and delivery, earning her a wave of praise from coaches Reba McEntire, Snoop Dogg, and Michael Bublé. “Kayleigh, that was wonderful,” McEntire said after the performance. “Your yodels were really, really perfect.” Ahead of the performance, Clark received guidance from “mega mentor” Joe Walsh (Eagles), who advised her to trust her breath control and not be intimidated by the climactic high notes. That note paid off. Clark’s delivery was confident, polished and emotionally resonant — drawing clear comparisons to early-2000s country stars while asserting her place as a rising voice in the genre. Still, it was a tough matchup. Clark was p…",

Last week’s reports revealed that Apple will pay Google around $1 billion a year for a custom-built Gemini AI model to power the next version of Siri, expected to debut with iOS 26.4 next spring. It’s a huge deal between two rivals, but according to a new report, Apple isn’t planning to draw attention to who’s behind the technology. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple has no plans to publicly acknowledge that Gemini will partly power Siri. Internally, the Gemini-based model is referred to as AFM v10, short for “Apple Foundation Model version 10,” a name chosen to obscure the partnership and avoid confusing staff and customers. Gurman adds that Apple prefers to present it as part of its own system, even though much of the core model isn’t.",

Fitbit Charge 6: The best sleep tracker overall I’ve tested dozens of sleep trackers, and Fitbit continues to offer some of the most reliable and actionable sleep data I’ve gotten my hands on. The Fitbit Charge 6 is my top pick for tapping into that ecosystem. The band-style tracker is compact, lightweight, and comfortable enough to wear all night, which is essential for bedtime tracking. Yet, despite its small form factor, it also packs in a well-rounded user experience for all-day wear. Alongside standout sleep features, the Charge 6 supports over 20 exercise modes, offers stress tracking via EDA scans, and integrates smoothly with Google’s growing suite of apps, all on a bright, colorful AMOLED display.",

You can actually see the phone’s blue coolant circulating through the whole system. The RedMagic 11 Pro uses an unfreezable, server-grade fluorinated liquid and a piezoelectric micropump to move coolant through a loop. The REDMAGIC 11 Pro , Nubia’s brand-new gaming phone, is already one of the most eye-catching Android flagships right now. However, it turns out that the phone’s hidden liquid cooling system might just be its most jaw-dropping feature. In a new YouTube Short, JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson peeled back the rear cover of the phone to show what’s concealed underneath, and it’s unlike anything we’ve seen before.",

    "body": "Many Android apps ask for your current location to show you more relevant results or help with directions, but most don’t need your precise GPS coordinates to do the job. That’s why Android offers two levels of location accuracy: Precise and Approximate. These options are controlled by two different Android permissions and are intended for different kinds of apps. If an app requests a precise location, Android provides the most accurate estimate it can, usually within 3 to 50 meters (about 10 to 164 feet). If an app requests an approximate location, however, Android will only provide a rough estimate of your device’s location, which may only be accurate to within 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles). This is why navigation apps always require your device’s precise location, while most other apps can function perfectly well with either.",

Over the years, most of us of a certain vintage have built our music libraries piece by piece, from rare digital downloads and fan remixes to songs that never made it to streaming platforms. Even mixtapes if you, like me, are a 90s or earlier kid. For me, those tracks represent more than nostalgia. They’re a record of growing up online, scouring file-sharing forums for one-off singles, MySpace, and now, an ever-growing collection of vinyl records collected during my travels. Every record I collect tells a story. A dusty Cuban jazz album I picked up in Havana, the Japanese city pop release I stumbled upon in a secondhand store in Shibuya, or the deep techno record from a small label in Berlin that went under decades ago. You catch my drift. These albums aren’t just music albums, they’re memories. And yet, when I want to go back to any of them on the go, it’s not an option. Way too many of them don’t exist anywhere in the digital domain. Not on Spotify, not on Apple Music, and all too often, not even on YouTube.",

That’s the entire purpose of a smartwatch for me. While my watch can track everything from my broken sleep to biking laps — you know, the calories I burn — without me lifting a finger, it can’t as seamlessly track the calories that go into me. I’ve always struggled with nutrition tracking. Even though dozens of apps let you log your daily meals, the friction remains. The only wearable that could bridge this wide gap in fitness tracking, I foresee, is smart glasses.

The rollout brings flash cards, quizzes, and the ability to select or unselect sources when chatting or creating outputs in the Studio tab. Chatting on mobile has also been improved with better quality, a larger context window, and longer conversation memory. NotebookLM is one of the best AI tools Google has to offer, especially for learning. It takes all of the information crammed in your notebook and summarizes the contents to help you grasp key concepts quickly. And since it only uses the sources you provide, the chance of it hallucinating is lower than that of other AI tools. Google has begun rolling out an update that should make NotebookLM even more helpful for your studying needs. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

Tragically, many lives were lost, entire homes were destroyed, and communities were left to rebuild from scratch. Amidst the devastation, one Reddit user shared an incredible story of their own survival, as well as that of their iPhone, adding to a growing list of phones that have beaten the survival odds recently.

Google’s Pixel Watch 4 appears to be significantly lacking in features compared to the Galaxy Watch 8 , particularly in terms of health-related metrics. That said, Google is working to plug this gap and is experimenting with two new features that will warn users of any looming illnesses. These features are currently under trial with Fitbit Labs, and a small group of users can participate in testing them ahead of others. With an upcoming update, some Pixel Watch users may be able to highlight any concerning deviations in their vitals. According to 9to5Google , a new feature called “Unusual Trend Detection” has been added to Fitbit Labs , a program that allows users to evaluate new features before they are rolled out to a broader user base.",
