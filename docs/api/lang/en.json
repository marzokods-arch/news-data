While sitting down with The Breakfast Club , Cannon spoke on his mental health journey and admitted that he was dealing with trauma after going through his divorce with Mariah Carey . And when he was asked by co-host Charlamagne Tha God if the Wild-N-Out creator thought having 12 kids with six different women was a response to his trauma, he said yes. Related 12 Kids and Counting: A Full List of Nick Cannon&#8217;s&nbsp;Children Coachella 2026: Every Electronic Artist Playing The Festival Coachella 2026: Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber, Karol G to Headline &#8220;I&#8217;m learning that now, and it wasn’t like I was acting out,&#8221; Cannon said. &#8220;It was more of being careless, being frivolous with my process, because I could do it, because I had the money, because I had the access to whoever and however I wanted to move. Opposed to doing a mature thing and saying, ‘Hey, well, it probably makes more sense to do this.’ And then, obviously, life happens as well. So it wasn’t like, ‘Well, I’m gonna go have 12 kids.’ It was more about, like, ‘Yo, I’mma just live life and have fun and whatever happe…",

CMA Awards winner Ballerini and the Outer Banks actor publicly confirmed their relationship in 2023 and walked the CMT Awards red carpet together. They&#8217;ve since accompanied each other on various red carpets and awards shows and let fans in on their relationship through social media posts over the past few years. &#8220;They’re&nbsp;two adults who gave it their all and tried to do everything they could to make it work, but ultimately couldn’t.

    "body": "Gavin Adcock released his first songs back in 2021, but over the past year, he&#8217;s hit a new career high, thanks to his album Own Worst Enemy . The August-released set debuted at No. 4 on Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart and at No. 14 on the all-genre Billboard 200 . Adcock also earned a string of RIAA gold and platinum-certified songs this year. But beyond music accolades, the Warner Music Nashville-signed Adcock has been in plenty of headlines, for reasons outside of music. He was arrested in May in Wilson County, Tennessee, on charges including reckless driving and an open container violation (he was released and the charges were later dismissed ). He played off the arrest by later releasing the song &#8220;Morning Bail.&#8221; But he also has a penchant for seemingly beefing with several people, from fellow artists to a concert sound technician. Adcock has stirred up controversy for expressing his views on Beyoncé&#8217;s Cowboy Carter album, calling out Zach Bryan in an incident involving a fan autograph, and engaging in an ongoing back-and-forth beef with country/Americana artist Charley Crockett. In his recent interview with Billboard , Adcock discussed his p…",
