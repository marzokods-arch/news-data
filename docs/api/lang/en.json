On Tuesday night&#8217;s (Sept. 16) episode of AGT , Sanchez did her chances of winning absolutely no harm with a soulful performance of “Golden Hour” by JVKE , hitting high notes and exercising vocal control like a pro. “I’m so proud that you’re my Golden Buzzer,” judge Sofía Vergara remarked. “Jessica, you get better and better. It’s perfection, your voice, your little belly, your story. I mean, there’s nothing I would change about you or how you do your singing. You’re amazing. I’m so happy for you.” Howie Mandel was happy for her too, but he questioned Sanchez&#8217;s song choice. America will decide if he&#8217;s right. “Hopefully they love that song more than me,” he remarked, as boos rung out in the audience. Mel B said the singing hopeful&#8217;s vocals were “just magical,” but also questioned the choice of song. &#8220;I could see that it affected you and that’s the most important thing,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;It was beautiful.” Simon Cowell, as he so often does, went last with his critiqu…",
