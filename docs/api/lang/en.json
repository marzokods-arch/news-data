Because this occurred way over near the edge of the Sun, it was unlikely to have any effect on Earth.

While some of the strands fell back into the Sun, a substantial part raced into space in a bright cloud of particles. Launched in December 1995, the joint NASA-ESA SOHO mission, was designed to study the Sun inside out. Though its mission was scheduled to run until only 1998, it has continued collecting data, adding to scientists&#8217; understanding of our closest star, and making many new discoveries , including more than 5,000 comets.
