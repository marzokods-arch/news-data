Thousands of people gathered dressed to the nines, the women rocking sequined gowns and kitten heels, the men wearing tailored suits and polished dress shoes. Their attire fused Puerto Rican culture and Mafia fantasy and seemed beamed in from decades ago — but the crowd entering Miami’s Kaseya Center on this warm evening wasn’t there for an act of yesteryear, but rather one of the hottest arena artists on the planet. “It was a whole vibe,” Rauw Alejandro says over Zoom months later, now off the road and back home in Puerto Rico. “It felt like we went back to the past and you can feel that energy. It’s not mandatory, but if you dress up, you’ll have more fun because you’re immersed in the story. You’re literally traveling to that time and age.” Like many arena and stadium stars today, the 32-year-old reggaetón star encouraged audiences to follow a special dress code for his show.

The viral sensation and boudoir photographer-turned-comic announced 22 new dates for his Boujee on a Budget Tour, which kicks off February 12 in El Paso, Texas, and runs through June 20 in Davenport, Iowa. The newly added leg will bring Mathews’ acclaimed live show to cities including Portland, Seattle, Cincinnati, Boston, Washington, D.C., Orlando, and Baton Rouge, among others. Tickets go on sale beginning Thursday (Oct. 30) at 10 a.m. local time via LiveNation.com, with artist presales opening on Tuesday (Oct. 28). Now nearing 100 performances, Boujee on a Budget is propelled by Mathews’ raw storytelling, southern wit, and unfiltered perspective on life as a gay man navigating small-town Alabama.
