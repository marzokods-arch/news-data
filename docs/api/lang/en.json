    "body": "George Clooney is looking back at one of the more surreal moments from his early Hollywood days — getting personally scolded by the legendary Frank Sinatra. While attending the Los Angeles premiere of his new film Jay Kelly on Thursday (Oct. 23), the actor recalled his brushes with legendary artists like Sinatra and Tony Bennett during a time when he was trying to get a foothold in the industry. “I remember being on the road [&#8230;] I was my Aunt Rosemary&#8217;s driver when she was singing,” Clooney told People . “And I hadn’t known her much when I was young because I lived in Kentucky. She was the Hollywood aunt. So I came out to make a living and I was her driver.” At the time, Clooney found himself in close proximity to giants of American music, including Bennett, Sinatra and more. “I got to drive [her] and Tony Bennett, and all of these really wonderful singers around for a year,” he said. “I got a really good life lesson in success and failure, and handling it.” One of the more unexpected encounters came courtesy of Sinatra himself, who wasn’t thrilled with a press boycott Clooney was involved in. “I remember he was mad at me once because I led this boycott about […] some …",

    "body": "Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has opened up about the band’s extended break from touring, revealing that personal loss and emotional burnout contributed to the group’s seven-year absence from the stage. In a new interview with The Times , Yorke reflected on the final days of the band’s A Moon Shaped Pool tour in 2018, which ended with a show in Philadelphia in August that year. “I guess the wheels came off a bit, so we had to stop,” Yorke said. “The shows felt great but it was, like, let’s halt now before we walk off this cliff.” The band recently announced their return to live performance with a limited run of 20 shows across five European cities — Madrid, Bologna, London, Copenhagen and Berlin — kicking off Nov. 4. All dates sold out shortly after going on sale. Yorke also addressed his personal grief following the death of his first wife, Dr. Rachel Owen, in late 2016. “I needed to stop anyway, because I hadn’t really given myself time to grieve,” he said. “My grief was coming out in ways that made me think, I need to take this away.” He added that while music was a source of healing, it also became a painful reminder. “There have been points in my life where I’ve looked for so…",
