The Grammy-nominated, multi-platinum artist announced via Instagram on Friday (Nov. 8) that he would not be performing at The Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland, New Zealand, as originally scheduled for tonight. “Dear Auckland, I’ve done everything I can,” he wrote on Instagram. “I just can’t shake it. It breaks my heart, I’ve probably missed three shows in the last decade. I pride myself on showing up no matter what. Just couldn’t do it this time. Please forgive me.” Fans reported that they didn’t discover news of the cancellation until arriving at the venue. The late notice left many frustrated and disappointed, particularly as some had travelled long distances to attend Jelly Roll’s first-ever New Zealand performance. The cancelled concert was set to wrap Jelly Roll’s tour across Australia and New Zealand, which marked the country-rock star’s first-ever visit to the region.

Appearing on the Nov. 6 episode of Bunnie Xo’s Dumb Blonde podcast, the multi-genre artist opened up about the relationship’s end with surprising clarity, saying: “We’re two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” He added that the “Sk8er Boi” singer helped him “grow up,” and that he&#8217;s now more secure in his identity than ever before. The former couple met in early 2021 while collaborating on music, and their joint single “Flames” dropped just weeks later. A whirlwind romance followed, with Mod proposing in Paris in April 2022. Less than a year later, the pair called off the engagement in February 2023. Though Lavigne has remained publicly silent on the split, Mod has continued to speak openly. In July 2023, he released the breakup track “Strangers,” with lyrics detailing the rise and fall of their relationship. The Paris-shot music video — filmed in the same city where he proposed — added further emotional weight. On the podcast, Mod said that his perspective on the breakup has shifted over time: &#8220;We&#8217;re two different people, but I…",

These categories welcome back a list of familiar faces, specifically in Fred again.., Kaytranada, Disclosure and Skrillex. These artists have tallied a combined 49 nominations and 13 wins, with Skrillex arguably being the Academy&#8217;s most loved dance artist, with his nine wins going back to 2012.

She had just come off a tour that, for the first time, kept her away from her home in Puerto Rico for months, experiencing the loneliness of hotel rooms, the exhaustion of travel, the stress of figuring out what she would do next. “I was missing my family a lot, and I don’t know, I was also coming from a moment of a lot of movement and speed,” recalls the Puerto Rican star in an interview with Billboard Español . “I didn’t allow myself to be present and enjoy all the fruits of the work I had been doing for so long. And all this chaos affected everything in my life: it affected my personal relationships, my work, my family relationships.
