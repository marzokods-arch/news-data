    "body": "J Balvin and Residente surprised fans by sharing a joint Instagram post on Wednesday (Dec. 31) that appears to symbolize reconciliation after their highly publicized feud since 2022. The rift stemmed from Residente&#8217;s &#8220;BZRP Music Sessions #49&#8221; with Argentine producer Bizarrap, a diss track aimed at Balvin that reached No. 22 on Billboard &#8216;s Hot Latin Songs chart in 2022 and currently boasts over 203 million views. The fallout between the two Latin icons was revisited last Friday (Dec. 26) as Balvin released his own collaboration with Bizarrap, “BZRP Music Sessions #62/66.” In the photo shared on Instagram, the artists are seen chillin&#8217; casually, smiling at the camera. The Colombian juggernaut sports a t-shirt and light blue denim jeans, while the Puerto Rican rapper wears a t-shirt and beige cargo pants. &#8220;Given the immensity of things happening in the world, this is possibly one of the smallest. But in such a complex world, two people who don’t agree on everything being able to reconnect seems valuable to us,&#8221; Balvin captioned the post in Spanish.

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020. The date, combined with the bubble-like appearance of the galaxies and the superheated gas seen with Chandra observations (represented in purple), inspired the scientists to nickname the galaxy cluster the Champagne Cluster, a much easier-to-remember name than its official designation of RM J130558.9+263048.4. The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters. Two clumps of individual galaxies making up the colliding clusters can be seen toward the top and bottom of center. (The image has been …",

Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team have also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

Since its inception, NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) has led this effort. CERES has a long history with seven different instruments flying on five different missions since 1997. As of today, six CERES instruments remain in orbit – two are no longer operational: the Proto-Flight Model (PFM) unit flew on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and functioned for a brief period, and FM2, which was powered-off in January 2025 due to battery constraints on Terra. The active CERES instruments are found on Terra (FM1), Aqua (FM3 and 4), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) (FM5), and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) mission, now known as NOAA-20 (FM6). Suomi NPP and the JPSS mission are partnerships…",
