The company announced the change today, and a new banner and “Devices” page within the app now explicitly state Health Connect will track your phone’s steps for other apps to use. This marks a significant shift for the platform, turning it from a simple data hub into a fitness tracking service. Last week, we reported that Google was bringing native step tracking to Health Connect , allowing the app to count your steps using your phone’s sensors. This marks a significant shift for the app, which currently doesn’t track any data on its own and instead acts as a hub for information from other health and fitness services. While that was its original purpose, it seems Google has bigger plans for the platform . This change suggests Health Connect could transform from a simple data hub into a full-fledged tracking platform, with native step counting being just the first step. When we first reported on this feature, though, we noted some uncertainty. Our evidence came from an analysis of the APK in the 2508 Android Canary release , but the feature itself wasn’t functional yet,…",

The software brings several key improvements, like expressive design, enhanced protection against malicious apps, and more transparent background activities. Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 8, based on Android 16, to the Galaxy S25 series . But Samsung isn’t the only brand rolling out the new Android OS to its devices this week. Motorola is also getting the ball rolling with a couple of its handsets. The stable version of Android 16 is starting to arrive on some Motorola phones. The first devices getting the software are the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (via YTECHB ) and the Edge 50 Fusion (via Gizmochina ). On top of that, it seems the release is only happening in specific markets at the moment, which include Brazil for the Edge 60 Pro and Mexico for the Edge 50 Fusion. It appears Motorola is taking a phased approach to its rollout before the broader release.",

On closer inspection, though, engineers have upgraded the agency’s Moon rocket inside and out to improve performance, reliability, and safety. SLS flew a picture perfect first mission on the Artemis I test flight, meeting or exceeding parameters for performance, attitude control, and structural stability to an accuracy of tenths or hundredths of a percent as it sent an uncrewed Orion thousands of miles beyond the Moon. It also returned volumes of invaluable flight data for SLS engineers to analyze to drive improvements. Teams with NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems integrate the SLS (Space Launch System) Moon rocket with the solid rocket boosters onto mobile launcher 1 inside High Bay 3 of the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in March 2025.

Smartphones may be our bread and butter, but we are absolute suckers around here for a nice handheld gaming console — so we were understandably very excited earlier this month when we got word about the ANBERNIC RG 476H on the way. At the time we made some inferences about the hardware we were likely to get, and it sure felt like this model could be shaping up to be a budget-friendly alternative to some of its peers. Today, we start learning just how close to the mark we were. The RG 476H looked like it was shaping up to be a more straightforward alternative to the RG Slide . Based on the naming, we were expecting the same sort of beautiful 4.7-inch 120Hz screen ANBERNIC gave us with the Slide, as well as the same workable (if less than a powerhouse) T820 chipset — and indeed, that’s exactly what ANBERNIC now confirms today.",

There’s plenty of ribbing back-and-forth, some of it good-natured, some of it not, between Android and iOS users. Passionate fans on both sides of the fence love talking about how their preferred platform is making great strides with intuitive design and effortless usability — and often can’t help but feel a little bit of smug satisfaction when things go spectacularly wrong for the other guys. Apple’s Liquid Glass design for iOS 26 has been controversial since almost day one, and with the update now widely out, users have spotted one decision that’s leaving them feeling a little off-balance.

If you’re like a lot of us, you’re always looking around for the best phone trade-in deals, maximizing the value you can get for your old phone while upgrading to a new one. But what if you’re still a big fan of that old phone, and would rather not get rid of it? Normally that would disqualify you from anything resembling a trade-in offer, but this week we’re looking at a promotion that’s shaped a bit like a trade-in, but functions more like a loyalty program, capable of saving you hundreds of dollars off a Nothing Phone 3 .",

As someone who has been a thin-phone skeptic, I’ve looked at the iPhone Air’s launch with the same disdain I reserved for the Galaxy S25 Edge : Why would anyone trade off crucial features like battery life and camera versatility for a flagship whose primary claim-to-fame is that it’s thin? After using the iPhone Air for about a day, I get it. I see why thin phones are hyped, though there’s still a long way to go before they become the default recommendation. The iPhone Air feels fantastic to hold",

I bring it along on road trips and plug it into my accommodation’s TV.

Alarms that fail to go off as scheduled should start displaying a slightly more helpful error notification. Sometimes, it’s the simplest things in the world that end up causing our most unexpected headaches. Google’s Clock app is about as straightforward as they come: it tells the time, lets you set alarms, and can run a stopwatch or a timer. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a recent update addressed our lack of imagination there, as users found the time rendered in unexpected ways, impairing visibility. Thankfully, it looks like some fixes are already arriving.

The new search functionality works for local media and integrates with Google Photos to search your cloud library and offer suggestions for people or places. The “Albums” tab is also being renamed to “Collections” and now groups folders to better organize your media and separate personal albums from app-generated ones. Android’s Photo Picker allows you to selectively share photos and videos with an app, rather than granting it access to your entire media gallery. It’s a privacy-preserving tool intended for apps that only have a one-time or infrequent need for your media. While its simple two-tab UI — one for a chronological view of your media and another for your albums — is straightforward, it’s also arguably too simple, lacking many of the convenient features of Android’s older file picker.

    "summary": "Pixel phones are starting to get native call recording — with one big asterisk.",
    "body": "TL;DR Google appears to be backing down from its long-standing position against letting Pixel phones record voice calls. The company has already updated support pages, indicating that the option may exist for Pixel 6 and later models. So far we’ve only seen confirmation out of India, and it’s unclear which markets will ultimately get access. Smartphones may do a million and one different things, but at their very core, these devices are still phones. You may not make a ton of voice calls anymore, but plenty of users still do, which just serves to make it all the more frustrating that voice calls haven’t routinely gotten the same kind of attention and feature upgrades as all the other corners of our phone. One space where that’s noticeably true is in terms of call recording — these are fully digital devices, with mountains of storage, and it makes all the sense in the world to let us archive voice calls the same way we do text messages. The varying legalities behind doing so in different jurisdictions don’t help the problem any, and that’s left phones like Google’s Pixel series without the option — at least, Call Notes notwithstanding.",

The update also adds compatibility for three tricky Disney Wii games thanks to clever hacks. Bluetooth passthrough, which enables Wii Remote support, has been patched to work with more modern Bluetooth adapters. Dolphin has long been one of the most impressive emulators around, but despite more than 20 years of development, there’s still more work to be done. In the latest release 2509, some of that work actually had to be undone to finally fix crashes that have plagued the emulator for years. Dual Core mode was first implemented over a decade ago, and it was key to emulating GameCube and Wii games at playable framerates. At the time, processors simply weren’t fast enough to keep up with the demands of the emulator, so by taking a note from the original hardware and utilizing additional cores, performance jumped significantly.",

To solve this, Google introduced the Themed Icons feature in Android 13, allowing users to change app icon colors to match their system theme.

Multiple Android Auto users are reporting on Reddit that the media player has recently lost its color. While the rest of the display is fine, the media player window now looks washed out. Not only does the lack of contrast look bad, but it also makes it difficult to read any white text in the window. Given that the song title, artist name, and icons are all white, this can be a big problem.",

Unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the 200MP sensor will be used for the OPPO Find X9 Pro’s telephoto camera. The 200MP sensor should allow the OPPO to reduce the number of telephoto cameras on Find X9 Pro to one, as opposed to two on its predecessor. Android phone makers constantly engage in number games to boast improvements over previous generations and as compared to the competition. Phone cameras, with their ever-evolving megapixel counts , especially take center stage in this rivalry, as brands continually vie to outdo one another. Recently, 200MP has been the current gold standard for cameras on flagship Android phones. Samsung has adopted it for the primary cameras of its top-end phones, such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Edge , and most recently, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Meanwhile, Vivo has reserved a 200MP sensor for its telephoto camera, and another brand is about to follow suit.",

The charger’s branding differentiates between sustained power (40W) and peak power (60W). It supports the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, a step toward more open charging solutions, unlike many proprietary Android chargers. Apple launched the iPhone 17 series last week, but there was one new piece of hardware launched alongside it that flew under the radar: Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max. The name is a mouthful, but surprisingly, it’s one of the few chargers on the market that is “honest” with its fast charging marketing, a trait that more Android brands should copy with their chargers. Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max more accurately describes what it can do than quoting a singular number. In the branding, 60W represents the maximum power output, i.e., the peak, whereas 40W represents more sustained output once the charger inevitably gets thermally throttled.",
