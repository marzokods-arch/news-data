Hosted by LL COOL J, the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards were one of the best VMAs in recent memory, a smart mix of newcomers who brought their A-game (and inventive visuals) and veterans who demonstrated why they’ve lasted in the game so long. Of the latter category, each one received some sort of Moon Person trophy during the three-hour telecast, with Mariah Carey receiving the Video Vanguard Award, Ricky Martin collecting the Latin Icon Award and Busta Rhymes getting the Rock the Bells Visionary Award. As with any awards show, the awards are important, sure – and based on the deeply personal acceptance speeches from ROSÉ and Ariana Grande, they seem to mean quite a lot – but most viewers are tuning in to see some incredible live music.
