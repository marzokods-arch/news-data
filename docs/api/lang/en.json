    "body": "Summer Walker looks like she has the post-wedding blues on the album artwork for Finally Over It , which she unveiled on Wednesday (Nov. 5). While being showered with white rose petals, the R&amp;B superstar poses with an elderly white man she&#8217;s taken as her husband, drawing inspiration from then-26-year-old model and actress Anna Nicole Smith and 89-year-old billionaire oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II&#8217;s 1994 wedding photos. In September, Walker stepped out with another elderly white man on the red carpet of the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards &#8212; where &#8220;Heart of a Woman&#8221; was nominated for best R&amp;B &#8212; while re-creating Pamela Anderson&#8217;s 1999 VMAs look. While unveiling the vinyl artwork last month, she wrote, &#8220; Finally Over It is a 2-part album about the choices we have left when true love feels impossible. One side chooses me, the other sacrifices love completely.

While users can download the Theme packs app today, the features will require another system or server-side update from Google. The first seasonal theme pack release includes three themes based on the Wicked: For Good movie. Pixel phones might be getting theme packs and prioritized notifications in a future Pixel Drop, and Google is releasing a new app ahead of time. Theme packs were already in the works as of early October, when Android Authority managed to surface a new “Themes” entry in the Settings app on Google Pixel phones. Now, Google published a new “Theme packs” app on the Google Play Store, exclusively for Pixels. Theme packs will make it possible to “personalize your Pixel in one tap,” according to the Play Store listing . “Instantly unlock a complete refresh that updates your wallpaper, icons, sounds, GIFs, and more with seasonal theme packs.”",

Although the Galaxy S25 series is exclusively powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon silicon, Samsung is expected to bring its Exynos chips back for its 2026 phones. We have heard some interesting information about the Exynos 2600, like having a “heat pass block” to keep the chip’s temperature down. Now we’re learning more about Samsung’s next SoC from a new leak. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

For decades, the Billboard Hot 100 has documented the hottest songs in the country &#8212; but some of them have been particularly hot, if you catch our drift. From George Michael to Salt-N-Peppa to Drake, numerous artists have scored hits on the chart with songs about S-E-X. Whether it&#8217;s about having it, wanting to have it or not having enough of it, music that touches on the topic &#8212; in varying degrees of detail &#8212; has proven to do quite well commercially. Only a handful of performers, however, can say that they&#8217;ve created the absolute biggest sex-related tracks of all time by Hot 100 standards, and those are the ones who Billboard is choosing to recognize today. Below, we&#8217;ve rounded up the 25 most successful songs on the subject by looking back through all of the entries with the word &#8220;sex&#8221; or &#8220;sexy&#8221; in the title and scoring them based on chart performance and longevity.

    "body": "TL;DR A flag in Android’s Carrier Config Manager allows cellular carriers to artificially inflate the number of bars shown on your phone. Google explains that the majority of carriers require this option, and its addition to the Android codebase dates back to 2017. Android artificially inflates network signal strength to appear as a five-bar scale, rather than the original four-bar scale. Network carriers aren’t afraid to use clever names and marketing to make their cellular performance appear better than it actually is. A prime example is AT&amp;T’s use of the 5GE badge , which is 4G LTE rather than 5G . The truth is, many carriers use similar strategies to market their cellular networks. A flag in the Android codebase that’s recently been getting a lot of attention has led some to believe Google was colluding to artificially inflate signal strength, but the true purpose of the flag appears to be much simpler. A report by Nick vs Networking from last month highlighted a flag named KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL in Android’s Carrier Config Manager. The Carrier Config Manager explains this flag as determining if the Android system “should interpret all signal strength as one bar …",

While Metro’s old plans started at $5, the new service begins at $3 a month, with its most expensive option maxing out at $10 a month. New features include same-day screen repairs, more claims, added perks like McAfee and Scam Shield, and more. Last night, US Mobile announced plans for its new insurance service , which will officially launch next week under the name US Mobile Protect. Hot on its heels, Metro by T-Mobile has unveiled a new insurance program of its own. Unlike US Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile already offered insurance through its older Premium Handset Protection (PHP) program, provided in partnership with Assurant and starting at $5 per month. T-Mobile hasn’t officially confirmed its new insurance partner this time, but the rebrand signals a major change.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google says “Nano Banana” began as a late-night placeholder name typed by a PM when submitting the model anonymously. The nickname stuck after the model went viral, prompting Google to adopt it. As the name caught on, Google used banana icons in the Gemini app to signpost the feature. If you’ve been wondering why Google’s viral image editor ended up with the nickname “Nano Banana,” the mystery’s over. The team says the moniker started life as a throwaway placeholder, and then the internet refused to let it go. On the latest episode of the Made by Google podcast , product lead David Sharon explains that the model’s official name is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. However, when a Product Manager named Nina submitted the model anonymously to the LM Arena benchmark website, allowing users to test it out, she had to enter a temporary label that kept it anonymous. At 2:30 in the morning, “Nano Banana” popped into her head. The next thing they knew, the model had gone viral, and people kept using the playful name, so Google ultimately embraced it in public.",

It also appears to have an all-glass front, as well as transluscent, unlabeled buttons.",

The device brings streaming, smart-home integration, and Dolby Audio to a budget-friendly package. It builds on Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube projector with refined features and a lower price point. Aurzen’s earlier D1R Cube introduced Roku’s first projector integration and delivered 1080p resolution, Dolby Audio, and auto-focus and auto-keystone correction at a price of $249. The new EAZZE D1R keeps those hallmarks while adding broader smart-home compatibility, Apple AirPlay casting, and a lower $199 price tag.

Wider availability will help the Android XR platform, especially given the Galaxy XR headset’s price advantage over competitors. Samsung launched the Galaxy XR headset in the US and South Korea last month. While the $1,800 price tag makes it a tough sell for many people, there’s still considerable interest in this new form factor and the Android XR platform. It remains to be seen where else Galaxy XR will launch, but a new leak suggests Samsung has some significant plans for expansion in 2026. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

But there are some days when I’m still jealous, furious, and furiously jealous of Apple’s influence on the entire mobile ecosystem. See, not only did a few Android brands decide to adopt Liquid Glass-like influences in their own Android skins (I’m looking at you, vivo and Xiaomi), but more and more app developers are already adopting the design language in their iOS apps, too.

The project signals a strategic push to compete with Chromebooks and affordable Windows laptops, especially in education, where Apple currently trails rivals. If priced around $699-$799, the new Mac could reshape Apple’s entry-level lineup by offering macOS at budget pricing and pulling more students into its ecosystem. For years, the most affordable way to experience an Apple laptop has been to wait for discounts on older MacBooks, or to recreate the “Mac” experience by pairing an iPad with a keyboard. But that may soon change. Apple is reportedly developing a lower-cost Mac laptop aimed at students and mainstream buyers, according to a new Bloomberg report. The machine is expected to sell “well under $1,000” by using less-advanced components such as an iPhone-class A-series processor and a smaller, lower-end LCD panel, sized slightly below the current MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch panel.

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR JerryRigEverything tore down the REDMAGIC 11 Pro, calling it “the most powerful phone on the planet.” The teardown reveals the full circulating coolant loop and the largest vapor chamber he has seen in a phone. It survived all durability tests, booted up afterward, and even includes oil in the coolant for a lava lamp visual effect. Some people might see a phone with visible coolant sloshing around inside it as an accident waiting to happen. However, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything proves that the new REDMAGIC 11 Pro is anything but, as he reveals the secrets to what he calls “the most powerful phone on the planet.” In his new video , Nelson dismantles what REDMAGIC calls the world’s first mass-produced liquid-cooled smartphone. The 11 Pro’s blue coolant can actually be seen circulating the back when the phone is switched on, pumped by a microscopic piezoelectric motor that pushes liquid through a sealed loop. The system works in tandem with a 24,000 RPM internal fan and what Nelson describes as the largest vapor chamber he’s ever seen in a phone.",

The device follows Kobo’s Remote, which debuted earlier this month with the same functionality. These releases highlight a growing interest in remote page-turners, something Amazon currently doesn’t offer. When it comes to e-reading , we’ve grown comfortable with the touchscreen tap or swipe. However, a new wave of add-ons, namely Bluetooth remotes that bring physical buttons back into play, is reshaping how we flip through digital pages. This week, German-based Tolino, a Rakuten Kobo subsidiary, joined that movement with the launch of its own remote control page turner, signaling that Kobo’s influence extends beyond its own lineup. The Tolino Flip connects to compatible Tolino e-readers via Bluetooth with a range of roughly 20 meters. Measuring about 10 cm long and weighing just 26.5 grams, it features an ergonomic design, two tactile buttons for forward and backward turns, and a removable wrist strap. The device runs on a single AAA battery, promising months of use, and comes in black or white finishes. It is available now for preorder from the Tolino websi…",

I say this because Samsung is the only manufacturer making Android devices that goes to the extent of remaking every menu and sub-menu, including even the highly ignored Digital Wellbeing dashboard. With its upcoming One UI 8.5 interface , Samsung could be taking a bold step towards reshaping the interface that has remained largely unchanged for the past two generations. Some of these changes are controversial and hold the potential to spark off a fresh iOS vs. Android comparison. But there’s one change that I wholeheartedly look forward to: a striking revamp of the Quick Settings panel . Based on the leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to adopt Android 16’s extensive customization options for Quick Settings — with an extra shot of newness . Even before the One UI 8.5 beta has been released, I’m genuinely rooting for this option to be a reality and feel it could be a dramatic improvement — beyond visual appeal — to the panel that One UI has seen in recent years.",

This change will be introduced with the upcoming Nothing OS 4.0 beta update, scheduled for release by the end of the month. If there’s one peculiar characteristic of the Carl Pei-led tech brand Nothing, it’s the propensity for unusual choices and hot takes. The brand has consistently also maintained a strong stance on privacy. That is why its recent decision to include certain third-party apps on some of its phones from the factory sparked strong opposition from users. Now, it seems the brand is taking a half-step back and will allow users to delete some of these apps — but will continue to install them on some non-flagship phones.

The system appears to be just a Retroid Pocket Flip 2 with the artist’s brand on top of it. Retroid has responded by stating, “He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own.” The rapper known as Soulja Boy is back in the news today. No, the artist best known for “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” didn’t release a new song. Rather, it appears he’s trying his hand at selling gaming hardware once again. And the system he’s selling appears to be a clone of an emulation device from a well-known retro handheld gaming brand. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

These invisible ripples in space were first directly detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Traveling at the speed of light (~186,000 miles per second), these waves stretch and squeeze the fabric of space itself, changing the distance between objects as they pass. Waves In Space Gravitational waves are created when massive objects accelerate in space, especially in violent events. LIGO detected the first gravitational waves when two black holes, orbiting one another, finally merged, creating ripples in space-time. But these waves are not exclusive to black holes . If a star were to go supernova, it could produce the same effect. Neutron stars can also create these waves for various reasons.

The evening of October 6, look up and be amazed as the full moon is bigger and brighter because – it’s a supermoon! Illustrated infographic showing the difference (as seen from Earth) between perigee, when a supermoon appears, and apogee, when a micromoon appears. NASA/JPL-Caltech This evening, the moon could appear to be about 30% brighter and up to 14% larger than a typical full moon. But why? Supermoons happen when a new moon or a full moon coincides with “perigee,” which is when the moon is at its closest to Earth all month. So this is an exceptio…",

Credits: NASA/Keegan Barber The Sun and Our Lives On a clear night, you might see thousands of stars in the sky. Most of these stars are dozens or hundreds of light years away from us. A light year is the distance a beam of light travels in a year: about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). This means that for those stars we see at night, it takes their light, which travels at about 186,000 miles per second (or about 300 thousand kilometers per second), dozens or hundreds …",

Hurt (IPAC) The (Proto) Planet: WISPIT 2b The Discovery: Researchers have discovered a young protoplanet called WISPIT 2b embedded in a ring-shaped gap in a disk encircling a young star. While theorists have thought that planets likely exist in these gaps (and possibly even create them), this is the first time that it has actually been observed. This image of the WISPIT 2 system was captured by the Magellan Telescope in Chile and the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. The protoplanet WISPIT 2b is a small purple dot to the right of a bright white ring of dust surrounding the system’s star. A fainter white ring outside of WISPIT 2b can be seen. Laird Close, University of Arizona Key Takeaway: Researchers have directly detected – essentially photographed – a new planet called WISPIT 2b, labeled a protoplanet because it is an astronomical object that is accumulating material and growing into a fully-realized planet. However, even in its “proto” state, WISPIT 2b is a gas giant about 5 times as massive as Jupiter. This massive protoplanet is just about …",
