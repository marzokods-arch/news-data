Generally, songs make steady runs up and down the Hot 100, though in more recent years it’s become more common for titles to debut at high ranks thanks to splashy streaming starts and then decline, with many also regaining their footing on the chart as their radio airplay solidifies. Per Hot 100 rules , to re-enter after having graduated to recurrent status, a song must garner enough chart points, with a notable reason for its resurgence.
