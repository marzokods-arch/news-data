Perhaps that's why I'm excited for the latest comedy adventure of the same name from Size Five Games, which has just announced that it'll let you embark on a mission of planetary destruction later this month. Earth Must Die wraps you in the silken robe of VValek Lizardtongue, a megalomaniacal alien nepo baby who has just inherited the kingdom of Tyrythia from his father. Unfortunately, he's instantly lost control of his realm due to the invasion of robotic Terranoids that killed his father in the first instance. Naturally, Vvalek decides to take his frustration out on Earth, for reasons we'll presumably discover while playing. Like Size Five's previous game Lair of the Clockwork God , Earth Must Die is inspired primarily by the comedy point 'n' click adventure games of the '90s. But it boasts a much more modern animation style and an absolutely stellar voice cast that includes major video game voice actors and some serious British comedy talent. Said cast includes (but is not limited to) Final Fantasy 16 lead Ben …",

Hundreds of cut voice lines lurk within The Witcher 3's game files, ranging from simple one-liners to dialogue choices and even entire cutscenes. Under the forensic eye of PC gaming's modding community, however, nothing remains hidden for long. Over the last few years, The Witcher 3 mega-mod Brothers in Arms has restored hundreds of these cut lines (alongside other features like missing NPCs, restored books and journal entries). Brothers in Arms has been regularly updated since its release in 2021, with a new update reinstating even more missing dialogue from CD Projekt's cutting-room floor. These newly restored lines and cutscenes were highlighted by YouTuber xLetalis . The most notable is a new romance scene between Geralt and Yennefer that occurs during the quest The Last Wish. It revolves around a dialogue choice for Geralt where he chooses whether to say \"I love you\" to Yennefer. In the original version, if he chooses not to sa…",

    "body": "Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney recently said digital storefronts like Steam should stop using AI disclosure labels because \"AI will be involved in nearly all future production\" anyway. PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde disagreed (as do I), but he also noted that such disclosures can be tricky for developers: \"Does it count if you used Photoshop's generative fill tool while making concept art that was never intended for the public eye? Or if you used Claude to generate a few code snippets? Or if someone in marketing used ChatGPT to make a spreadsheet?\" It seems that Valve has also been contemplating these questions and has made a tweak to its AI disclosure form for developers. In its submission form, Valve now specifies that game publishers must disclose pre-made generative AI assets only when used in marketing materials or content that \"ships with your game, and is consumed by players.\" That's via a screenshot of the form shared by Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo. In other words, Steam's disclosure requirement is not concerned with generative AI tools used behind the scenes for efficiency gains (presumably including coding helpers) or office work, but with things like final art, sound, and writin…",

Hours of my youth were spent fascinated by the fact that there were people out there making Oakeshott Type XVIII longswords and copies of Gandalf's Glamdring. In other words, I was destined from a young age to be the kind of person who'd see that Bladesong, a fantasy swordsmithing simulator, is launching in early access on Steam next week, and immediately add it to PC Gamer's task tracking software with the addendum \"hell yes dude this is videogames.\" (Image credit: Mythwright) Bladesong promises an elaborate and intricate toolset for handcrafting your Platonic ideal of a cool sword—whether that's a period-accurate arming sword or a glowing, rune-etched work of high fantasy maximalism with appropriately absurd proportions.

Currently, I think it's more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.\" Technically, it's possible to make money in Arc Raiders as a trader right now, but it's a slow, manual process to group up with customers, load into a match, drop items or blueprints on the ground, and sell those items later.

DieDevDie cameo in Quarantine Zone (Image credit: Brigada Games) Turns out, this odd-looking guy is based on the avatar of a TikTok and YouTube creator called DieDevDie who also provides voice acting for the character. This is one of a number of content creator cameos in Quarantine Zone, a little easter egg for anyone who happens to be familiar with them. Other than the change in appearance and some new voice lines, investigating these cameo survivors works the exact same way as a standard investigation . For example, when I investigated the skeleton, I checked him for all of the usual symptoms and found that he had a crossed reflex, meaning he was infected. As is policy, I sent him to be liquidated—sorry, Dev. Because he arrives on day five, before you unlock the scanner or the x-ray, you ca…",

Now I'm playing Pathogenic , another game that pulls off the same trick. All these years later, one of EA's weirdest experiments seems to be occupying hearts and minds once more. Where Everything is Crab reimagines Spore's \"creature stage\", Pathogenic is (as you might have guessed from the name) a take on the \"cell stage\".

The tech in question is Google's Fast Pair system, which allows compatible devices to connect super quickly (i.e. one tap and you're done).

Rather than just your phone being hooked up to your spangly new headphones, somebody else could join the connection, entirely undetected. Once in, they could do something as innocent as change volume levels or, far more worryingly, listen to what the microphones are picking up.

If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

    "body": "You can get a lot of gaming headset for under $300. Or, if you're willing to max out that figure, you can scoop up our top audiophile headphones pick, the Audeze Maxwell , complete with its pricey-yet-stunning planar magnetic drivers. Or, for $50 more, you can buy the Sony Inzone H9 II. Having seen the $350 price tag before receiving my review sample, I braced myself for the arrival of some really high-end audio gear. I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband. It doesn't look (nor feel) like the sort of plush skull-rester you might expect for this sort of cash. It's essentially…",

However, the meteoric rise in the demand for AI chips, backed by hundreds of billions of dollars, would appear to have pushed Apple aside in favour of Nvidia, according to a new report. This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

Since 2022, it's gained spell checking, a dark mode, tabbed windows, state preservation, and even basic formatting. With the latest update, tables have joined the feature set, which feels useful, along with AI text streaming, which feels decidedly less useful. As I use Notepad daily, I was already aware of the new additions, but it's thanks to Windows Latest that I know everyone using Windows 11 should see them, too. Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use. Adding or removing elements can be done through the same button, but it's easier to just right-click and edit everything from there. If you're a Notepad purist, yo…",

So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite?

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way.

In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained.

Here's the full photo: (Image credit: Amazon) Overall, the reveal seems to have gone better than Netflix's 2018 reveal of Henry Cavill as Geralt . Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy. In contrast, Turner's Lara seems to be fairly uncontroversial; not everyone's favorite take on the character, but there's no big upset over it.

That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

And thanks to From the Top , a recently-launched top-battling roguelike, it's a feeling I can once again relive. (Image credit: Junkfall33) From the Top released last month on Steam , and despite the fact that \"Beyblade roguelike\" seems like it should be an activation phrase for millions of online millennials, nearly nobody noticed. In it, you play as the captive of a top-obsessed tyrant who forces you to perpetually battle whirling bits of bladed plastic for his o…",

    "body": "The Fallout TV series is a hit, and so Prime is taking the obvious next step and firing up a \"reality competition series\" called, and based on, Fallout Shelter , a popular 2015 mobile game (that later came to PC and consoles) in which players design and manage one of Fallout's underground Vaults, where the survivors of nuclear war hide from the irradiated wasteland above. Fallout Shelter may not be the most action-packed game in the series, but you can't have people running around with high-powered weaponry popping each other's skulls like giant mutated zits in the real world—not yet, anyway. So, Fallout Shelter is a practical compromise, and it's also true to Bethesda's take on the setting: Cram a bunch of people into a small space, make them suffer, and see what happens. ICYMI: We just announced a new Fallout Shelter reality series, a fun collaboration between our friends at Kilter, Studio Lambert and Amazon Prime.Open casting is happening now if you think you've got what it takes to be a Vault dweller.

    "body": "The chilled-out extraction shooter Arc Raiders was one of 2025's surprise hits, and for my money is a game that works because it gets so many small things right. The length of runs is perfect, there's the perfect amount of distractions to regularly pull you away from the best-laid plans, and the exhilaration of making it out never gets old. And yet… man, do I dislike my inventory. It's slightly weird that a game that gets so much bang-on fumbles when it comes to inventory management and loadouts. Your stash is a key part of these games: it's what you're going in for, after all. But I really find it a bit of a pain sometimes in Arc Raiders, especially when I just want to get back in there without clicking through 15 screens and working out what I can and can't recycle or sell. It's the one bit of the game's rhythm that feels off. Turns out I'm far from alone. Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins told PCG sister site GamesRadar+ that Embark Studios is \"super aware\" of players' gripes around loadouts and shuffling items around between runs. And with regard to the game lacking custom loadouts, which players could quickly shuffle between runs, he says \"we've talked about\" them and it…",

Whether that holds up over the long term remains to be seen, but his promised retirement from the industry has also triggered the end of one of the best and longest-running videogame parody social media accounts: After 17 years, Peter Molydeux is calling it quits. The Peter Molydeux account was launched on Twitter in 2009 by artist Adam Capone, poking gentle, even affectionate fun at Molyneux by posting short, bizarre ideas for game concepts: \"Imagine a game in which you can date and form a deep meaningful relationship with your weapons,\" for instance, or, \"Imagine a game where you can do anything but once you do it you can never do it again.\" It didn't take long before the account exploded in popularity, and if you have any doubt about that, be aware that there's an entire, impressively detailed Wikipedia page dedicated to it. Some of the ideas shared by Molydeux were very funny, but it didn't take long before something even funnier happened: People began to notice that some of them were actually kind of interesting, too.
