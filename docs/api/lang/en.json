After relying on Google’s Wear OS for nearly a decade, it is switching to a custom interface to fix connectivity issues with the iPhone. TAG Heuer went a step further, securing a “Made for iPhone” certification for the smartwatch. Google’s Wear OS has been the choice of interface for several generations of TAG Heuer Connected series smartwatches. However, the luxury watchmaker is changing that with the latest generation of the series, replacing Wear OS with a custom operating system that plays well with the iPhone. TAG Heuer’s recently launched Connected Calibre E5 comes with a custom operating system bearing its name. The TAG Heuer OS, which replaces Wear OS on the Calibre E5, is claimed to be built “entirely in-house” for a “fluid, intuitive interface designed for seamless navigation.” WIRED notes that the OS is still based on Android, but these customizations will allow the smartwatch to also be compatible with iOS.",

The issue persists across multiple apps, including third-party ones that utilize Google’s EIS API. Ironically, the stuttering can be fixed by turning off video stabilization in the Pixel camera app. The Google Pixel 10 series includes some fantastic smartphones, but they aren’t perfect by any means. The Pixel lineup is infamous for having more than its fair share of bugs , and users must deal with them on new phones while also considering the possibility that it could be a hardware defect. One Reddit user found themselves in this spot when they noticed stuttering when video recording through the 5x telephoto camera. Thankfully, it seems this is a software bug related to EIS, so there’s hope of it being fixed through a software update once Google acknowledges the issue.

Check out the images below. One key feature seen in the screenshots is that you can let AI automatically screen a call after a certain amount of time. This time period varies from five to 30 seconds, although there’s also a custom option. It’s unclear whether this applies to any call, but it certainly suggests as much. Another screenshot adds that you can interrupt the AI at any time to respond, or wait for the call to end to receive a transcript.",

Each cover ships with a sticker pack to help users kick off their customization The covers cost $36.99, the same as standard fabric covers. Amazon quietly launched a new set of clear-back fabric cases for its e-readers, complete with a sticker pack. The new accessories lean into the existing culture of cover decorating within the Kindle community. The covers also mark an interesting signal from Amazon itself. For years, Kindles have leaned on a minimalist identity: matte finishes, muted colors, and quiet logos. The new covers invite a little more chaos and a lot more customization.

    "body": "Credit: Ryan Haines / Android Authority TL;DR Google TV may soon use Gemini to generate animated videos in response to questions. This might utilize a feature called Sparkify, which uses Gemini and Veo to create videos to help kids learn concepts or help them study. Sparkify is also available as an experimental feature for other devices. Gemini recently made its big screen debut with its launch on Google TV . Although it’s currently limited to a small set of smart TVs, alongside the Google TV streamer, Gemini has been promised to be rolled out to a broader set of Google TV models later in the year. While gearing up for the launch, Google is seemingly testing some AI-powered features to improve your video-watching experience.

The Moto Edge 70 is confirmed to have a 4,800mAh battery, a much larger capacity than the Galaxy S25 Edge and iPhone Air, as well as 68W fast charging. Leaks suggest that the phone will also feature a 50MP primary camera with OIS, as well as Pantone-branded color variants. Thin and light smartphones are the next craze after foldables, and it seems everyone wants to make one. Samsung stole the show with its thin-and-light Galaxy S25 Edge , and Apple impressed with the iPhone Air . While the phones are impressive, the big caveat with a thin and light smartphone is compromised battery life, as there’s less physical space available for a large battery. But what if you could pack a decent-sized battery in a thin and light phone? That would make it prime for replacing your conventional smartphone, and it seems Motorola is on track to do just that with the Moto Edge 70. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

    "body": "TL;DR The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar released a new update with support for dual-screen emulation. Most of the code comes from the work of another developer specialized in dual-screen forks. Several highly anticipated dual-screen handhelds are set to launch in the next few months. Android gaming handhelds are right in the middle of a dual-screen rennaisance, but all of that will mean little of the software doesn’t support it. Early handhelds, like the awkward transforming SUGAR 1 , used workarounds to get 3DS games to display on both screens, but a new update means those workarounds are a thing of the past. The Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar, which continues the work of the now-defunct Citra, just dropped release 2123.3 with some big changes to how the app handles secondary displays. Now, the app can output to both screen simultaneously, with touch screen support on both. It also incorporates a fix for the Retroid Dual-Screen Add on to rotate the top screen.",

These new alerts aim to solve the service’s poor discoverability, as many users are unaware that Health Connect exists on their phones. The prompts come as Google prepares to expand the platform with new features, such as native step tracking in an upcoming Android update. There are many excellent health and fitness trackers on the market, most of which have their own apps for viewing the data they collect. If you have a fitness band from brand A, a treadmill from brand B, and a digital scale from brand C, getting a holistic view of your health and wellness data can be a messy process. To make it easier for these apps to share data, Google created the Health Connect service back in 2022. Although the number of compatible apps and its feature set have grown steadily since its debut, many people still don’t know it exists. That’s why Google is sending alerts prompting users to connect their apps to Health Connect. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",
