Scheduled for a six-year tour, Terra outlasted its life expectancy by nearly two decades. Despite its longevity, Terra’s mission scientists stopped making inclination adjustments in 2020, allowing the satellite to slowly drift out of its contained orbit. The mission team has also begun the painful process of shutting down the five key instruments as the satellite is prepped for retirement. “Terra’s impressive human legacy stems from the fact that the mission’s hist…",

Some of the most legendary shoes in history made returns this year: the Air Jordan 1 High ’85 “Bred” came back in true OG form, the Undefeated x Air Jordan 4 finally reentered the conversation after only 72 pairs released back in 2005. Nike brought back one of its most iconic releases with the Air Foamposite One “Galaxy.” We also saw the return of the coveted “big bubble” on the Nike Air Max 95, as nostalgia reigned supreme in 2025. The year also marked a refreshing change for sneaker enthusiasts, though. For once, many highly anticipated releases didn’t immediately sell out. In 2025, you didn’t have to wake up at 10 a.m. ET and sit in an online queue just to miss out. In many cases, you could log on an hour later and still secure a pair, a rare but welcome moment of accessibility in modern sneaker culture.

A bulk container installed in the MSG, filled with viscous fluid and embedded particles, is subjected to oscillating frequencies to observe how the particles cluster and form larger structures in microgravity. Insights from this research may advance fire suppression, lunar dust mitigation, and plant growth in space. On Earth, the findings could inform our understanding of pollen dispersion, algae blooms, plastic pollution, and sea salt transport during storms. In addition to uncovering potential benefits on Earth, research done aboard the space station helps inform long-duration missions like Artemis and future human expeditions to Mars.
