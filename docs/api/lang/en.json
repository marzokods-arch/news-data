Jack Harlow showed up to the Marty Supreme movie premiere in New York Tuesday night, sporting an interesting footwear choice for the red carpet. The &ldquo;First Class&rdquo; rapper posed for photographers wearing a fitted beige turtleneck, baggy brown pants and&hellip; UGG Classic Mini Boots . Yes, the same cozy UGG boots that people typically wear to run errands or to lounge around the house had a surprising moment in the spotlight in front of other stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Timothee Chalamet and Tyler the Creator, who were all there to support the new film (no word on whether Chalamet, who recently wore the UGG Classic Short Boots courtside at an NBA game , spotted Harlow&rsquo;s footwear fit on the carpet). The rapper&rsquo;s strange footwear pick may have turned heads, but perhaps it&rsquo;s not entirely unfounded: after all, UGG says its boots can be worn outdoors, and the weather in New York was chillingly brisk, hovering around 30 degrees …",

Famously, though, there’s one part she auditioned for which she did not receive &#8212; Eponine in the Tom Hopper-directed Les Miserables . In an interview with Graham Norton in 2022, Swift hilariously recounts the process. “I was auditioning for two roles in Les Mis and I had done a few auditions and gone to New York and whatever. I think it had been established that I had more of the look of Cosette, but I had the range vocally of Eponine. So it was established that I was there for a good time, not a long time,” she explained. “But they were like, ‘You know, do you want to come to London for one last screen test? And you’ll get to screen test with Eddie Redmayne.’ And I’m like, ‘This sounds like an experience I want to have in my life.” “I get there and they are like, ‘OK, so we really want to make you look like Eponine.’ She wasn’t, like, loaded.

The galaxy, which is substantially smaller than our own Milky Way, lies 13 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear). Mrk 178 is one of more than 1,500 Markarian galaxies. These galaxies get their name from the Armenian astrophysicist Benjamin Markarian, who compiled a list of galaxies that were surprisingly bright in ultraviolet light. While the bulk of the galaxy is blue due to an abundance of young, hot stars with little dust shrouding them, Mrk 178 gets a red hue from a collection of rare massive Wolf–Rayet stars. These stars are concentrated in the brightest, reddish region near the galaxy’s edge. Wolf–Rayet stars cast off their atmospheres through powerful winds, and the bright emission lines from their hot stellar winds are etched upon t…",

The Opportunities in Research, Business, Innovation, and Technology (ORBIT) challenge is a multi-phase innovation competition designed to empower university and college students to develop next-generation solutions that benefit life on Earth and deep-space exploration. With up to $380,000 in total prize funding, NASA’s ORBIT challenges student teams to bring their most forward-thinking concepts to the table, either utilizing NASA intellectual property or conceptualizing their own. Teams are tasked with conducting targeted research, designing early mockups or models, and performing feasibility analyses to refine their ideas. Finalists then advance to a live showcase where they present their work to a panel of expert judges, who evaluate the proposals and select winners based on the teams&#8217; final pitches and responses to questions. The ORBIT has two challenge tracks for teams to choose from. The ORBIT Earth track requires teams to select a NASA-owned patent and develop novel commercial or nonprofit applications addressing real-world problems. …",
