Fallout co-creator Tim Cain explains the nine core types of missions you can be given, and, to my surprise, kill and murder are two separate categories. If you just want to know the nine kinds of quest, then here they are: murder, kill, the infamous fetch quest, collect, delivery, the often maligned escort quest, talk, puzzle, and timed. Murder involves dispatching of a \"particular person or set of people,\" whereas a kill quest will involve killing a certain amount of generic enemies, like five alligators, Cain explains. We all know what a fetch quest is—go here, get this item. A collect quest is different in the same way a kill quest is—gather a set amount of an item, like 20 nirnroot. A delivery quest is what Sam does in Death Stranding —you receive an item and take it to a destination or person. An escort quest is similar, only you need to deliver a person instead of an item, so they're often trickier. All of The Last of Us can be considered one long escort quest. One that sounds obviou…",

While the former is faster and more robust, the latter offers considerably more storage, making it ideal for housing terabyte-hungry games. And if SK Hynix's developments with PLC chips come to fruition, we could see a return to sensible SSD prices. PLC or Penta-Level Cell flash chips aren't a new thing, as Intel, Toshiba, and SK Hynix all started working on their development a little over six years ago. Up to now, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made, but as reported by Blocks and Files , it would appear that SK Hynix has perhaps unlocked the key to making them commercially viable. Flash memory cells work by using a large voltage to effectively ram electric charge across an insulated gap. Once there, it can remain stored for very long periods of time before requiring a top-up. Single-Level Cell (SLC) works like a switch: it either has all the charge or none, giving you two states or one bit of digital information. That only requires the voltage sensors with the flash chips to read one voltage, which is very quick and simple to do. However, because it's …",

Items are horribly balanced, and online matches are rife with players sandbagging and hoarding all the good items until the final stretch—that is, if you can even get to that point before the game throws an error at you and boots you back to the lobby. For a game that feels so heavily centred around its online competitive scene, it should be a dealbreaker. But Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hoists itself up with some of the cleanest, most robust kart racing I've seen on PC, tracks that leave a ton of room for experimentation and optimisation, vehicle customisation I could only dream of in other mascot-centric kart racers, and an abundance of unserious trash talk that feels so on-brand for the Sonic cast (Big: \"You look tense, buddy.

A collaboration between Capcom and luxury watchmaker Hamilton, the watches have been seen on the wrists of dual protagonists Grace and Leon in the trailers (though I can't say I especially noticed it because Leon was chainsawing a zombie doctor in half ). There are two models, only 2,000 will be made, and they will set you back a cool $1,475 for Grace's watch, and $2,175 for Leon's watch. Hamilton's descriptions of the watches are really something, the kind of thing only a very bored person who has nothing to do but sell watches would come up with. \"Grace wears a unique American Classic Pan Europ that blends strength and sophistication with a gold-accented strap, geometric case-back motifs, and a bold gold-and-black dial.\" Bold!

I might, however, blow off the dust and give it another whirl, because my favourite boy, the Executor, just got a huge sweep of buffs. Oh, and also, like, Guardians and Revenants and Raiders, but who cares about that—my Sekiro-loving heart just got everything it ever wanted. I'll just be going through the Nightfarers caught up in the patch 1.03.2 buffs one by one, starting with my favourite: The Executor's Cursed Sword skill, the thing that lets you parry, is now a lot stronger. Higher critical hits, better guard boost, more stagger damage when you deflect, and deflecting successfully while on low stamina won't result in a guard break anymore. I'm yet to test this myself, but the implication is that even on zero stamina, if your timing's good, you can just ride the lightning and never die.

I thought of the Maxwell's aluminum and steel chassis, the space-age drivers, and the feeling that your money had gone on something boutique. I anticipated the delivery with relish. You can imagine my surprise when what I pulled from the box looked… fairly ordinary. Dull, even. More than that, the weight threw me for a loop the second I wrenched the set from its cardboard insert. The Inzone H9 II feels astonishingly light. Almost to the point of suspicion, if I'm honest. I'm used to ultralight gaming mice for premium prices, but light-as-a-feather wireless gaming headsets? Initially, it feels a little flimsy. Hollow, even. Then there's the headband.

However, the meteoric rise in the demand for AI chips, backed by hundreds of billions of dollars, would appear to have pushed Apple aside in favour of Nvidia, according to a new report. This is what is being claimed by Tim Culpan , a technology reporter based in Taiwan. With years of experience at Bloomberg behind him, he is as good a source as you're going to get, unless any of the aforementioned parties decide to spill the beans directly. It certainly makes sense, though, because while the phone market is dominated by Apple , and is currently enjoying a marked rise in market share, the number of wafers it requires from TSMC will surely be less than what Nvidia is asking for. You only have to compare the physical size of their chips to realise this. Apple's latest A19 processor, as used in the iPhone 17, is manufactured via TSMC's N3P process node. It has a die area of around 100 square millimetres, which means a standard 300 mm wafer can yield many hundreds of dies. At the moment, Nvidia uses TSMC's N4 node for its current produc…",

Well, perhaps not the AI text streaming, because that's apparently still only for Copilot+ PCs (ones with a CPU that has a 40+ TOPS NPU in them), though Microsoft says it will eventually roll it out to all Windows 11 systems. The table function is blessedly simple in form and function, and if you're already familiar with tables in Microsoft Word, you'll have no problems using this one. You start by clicking on the icon in the menu bar, then dragging out the initial table you want to use.

By reusing characters and environments and minigames across the Like a Dragon series (and then remaking the games to do it all over again), it's able to pack each new game with a luxurious volume of stuff while simultaneously piling cutscenes to the rafters. So it's not at all surprising that the biggest new feature of Yakuza Kiwami 3's Dark Ties expansion is a roguelite mode that lets you beat up hordes of thugs copy-pasted from the streets of Kamurochō. Even so, there's something cleverly meta in building an entirely new and compulsively replayable randomized mode out of spare parts. It's almost a flex on games that do just one thing. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth contained within itself a whole Pokémon subsystem and Animal Crossing-style island building as mere side activities; why shouldn't Dark Ties tempt you to spend 20 hours doing runs to level up sidekicks, unlock new weapons, and earn stat-boosting gear like you would in any other roguelite? That's the gist of Hell's Arena, a new underground fight club hiding down a Kamurochō back street in the expansion starring Yakuza 3 villain (antihero?) Yosh…",

Released in 1998 and 1999, neither has been re-released in any sort of arcade collection or made available digitally until now, via in-game emulation in Yakuza 3 Kiwami. Both are delightful. Magical Truck Adventure is classic Sega arcade stuff: bright and bubbly and immediately throwing all sorts of stuff at the screen within seconds. You take control of one of two kids operating an old-fashioned train handcar, chasing down a pair of crooks who've stolen your magical jewel and decided to flee by rail, making them incredibly easy to catch. At least if you're in good shape: the physical arcade machine requires you to constantly pump the handcar's lever to maintain speed, while a pair of pedals allow you to lean left or right off the rails and jump over the barrels and other random obstacles they hurl your way. You also teleport/time travel between stages, naturally. (Image cred…",

Grace's parts will resemble Resident Evil 2 and 7, and will be \"really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay\". In other words, expect to do a lot of creeping around in the shadows, a lot of urgent crafting in corners, and every bullet expended will count. Leon's parts will predictably channel the \"thrilling tension\" of Resident Evil 4, as well as its action focus. If you've ever wanted to deliver a roundhouse kick to a shambling zombie nurse, have I got good news for you. \"Each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release,\" Nakanishi explained. It's an interesting approach to blend the two primary Resi gameplay styles together, and this hybrid presentation was settled on when the team realised they couldn't have it both ways with just Leon. \"We actually tried to make a genuine horror game with Leon,\" Nakanishi say…",

It's not a metroidvania this time, but rather a single-screen platformer mixing simple Astalon-style combat with puzzles. I played the demo last year and goddamn does this game feel good . While the puzzles generally boil down to \"grab key, reach exit\", the final game promises over 50 levels, so who knows where the team will take it.

Cavill's makeup and costuming ended up looking respectable in the show, but it was hard to tell that was going to be the case from our first look—that wig sure looked wiggy.

Every extraction shooter has their own take on the catch-up mechanic—typically balancing the free stuff by giving you crappy guns or limited armor. Depending on your point of view, Bungie's Marathon reboot might have the most generous or restrictive free loadout of the bunch. As detailed in a new vidoc showing off all of Marathon's runner shells (essentially hero characters), Bungie says Rook is a unique class option that functions like a free loadout. You can't bring anything in with you, but you're supplied with basic kit for free and can keep whatever you find on a raid. That's more-or-less how the free loadout works in Arc Raiders, the most popular extraction shooter of the moment, but Bungie's implementation is different in two major ways: Rook players will always enter a match late, making it harder to compete for the best loot on the map Rook players can only queue solo Depending on where you land on Arc Raiders' free loadout debate , that could be fantastic news.

You’re not getting quite the same level of GPU power or build quality either, but a cheaper laptop like the Acer Nitro V15 can still produce the goods. And the heat. And the noise. Acer has taken a trip back in time for the V15, with the model sent to PCG for review sporting a Core i7 13620H processor. That’s a Raptor Lake chip with ten cores split between four P-cores and six E-cores for 16 simultaneous software threads thanks to the 13th Gen coming before the death of P-core Hyper-Threading. It’s a chip from 2023, but its max turbo frequency of 4.9 GHz means it’s still competitive, even if it puts out a lot of heat and drives the Nitro’s cooling system crazy.

Would the dudes and the gorillas be better served by turning against the masters that placed them in this arena in the first place? Those are some of the thoughts propelling How Many Dudes? a so-called \"dudebuilder\" roguelike where you amass an army of guys to pummel animals of varying quantities and sizes (and occasionally toddlers, I don't like to think about the toddlers). Really though, it's an auto-battler, and it's honestly a solid bit of fun. Here's how it works: At the end of each round, you get to either post a flyer to start recruiting a certain dude type (thus defining your build), recruit a dude, or get one of three relics. If you've played any roguelike ever, you get how the relics work—they're stacking buffs that you need to synergise with your build, yadda yadda. The real tug of war is in the knockout system.

In the early 2000s, I recall its mice and keyboards being recommended pretty often on various forums. QPAD didn't give me my first ever mechanical keyboard—that honour goes to the original Razer BlackWidow—but it gave me my second, becoming one of my favourite upgrades I've had over all my years PC gaming. Back then, the QPAD MK-50 was one of a handful of great value mechanical gaming keyboards in what was then a pretty niche market. That keyboard lasted me years, and offered simple quality for a great price. Then the company all but disappeared, (in the UK at least, where I'm based). But now it's back, with a new stack of products in the UK and hopefully elsewhere as QPAD looks to expand globally again.

The first is that WoW64 mode, which can run 32-bit applications, is now considered fully supported and even includes 16-bit apps. As Windows can't natively run 16-bit applications, it's now as hard (or as easy) to run 16-bit apps on Linux as on Windows. Another big update with Wine 11, following on from its introduction in development builds of Wine 10, is the introduction of kernel module NTsync support. With this, Linux can emulate Windows NT' synchronisation primitives, which might not mean much to you, but minimises latency for demanding games. How much that performance increases by depends on many factors, but we expect a gaming uplift of some kind going forward.

Honestly, I could have watched another hour breaking down the themes and influences of Disco Elysium. Calling it a rich text is like saying Bill Gates has a couple of dollars. According to Helen Hindpere, writer on the original game and lead writer on the Final Cut, Disco Elysium technically has too much writing—at least for Articy, a tool for writing branching stories that Za/um used. \"I think every one of the writers that we had on the team previously had a problem with not writing enough,\" Hindpere says, \"and then for the first time ever the problem became that we were writing too much.

Which is still nearly four months away. Nevertheless, here we are in January 2026 with a bit more info on these forthcoming Ecco games. It's now confirmed that new California-based studio A&R Atelier is developing the new game, with original Ecco producer Ed Annunziata on board as chief creative officer. In a press release issued today A&R Atelier confirmed there are \"several new Ecco the Dolphin products and games\" in development, though whether these include the already-confirmed remasters and a new game, or something more, isn't specified. I've reached out to A&R Atelier for more specific details, though I assume they're keeping it under their hats for the big April reveal. I'll update if I hear back.
