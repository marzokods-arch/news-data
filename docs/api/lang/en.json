I want, literally, to ask people to f&#8211;kin’ punch you in the f&#8211;kin’ face. But you know what? I’m a lady, so I won’t.” While the comments sparked a wave of viral discussion online, Manson later doubled down on her stance in a statement posted to Threads, where she clarified her long-standing distaste for beach balls at shows and broader frustration with how some fans treat live music spaces. “I make NO APOLOGIES whatsoever for getting annoyed at beach balls at shows,” she wrote. “I joined a band because I HATED THE F&#8211;KING BEACH. I joined a band because I wanted to listen to Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Cure and be dark and beautiful.” She continued, “I love the musical community and I want to respect their artistry.

I am AFAB transmasculine non-binary. Earlier this year, I had top surgery. I was born and perceived as female, but that label never represented who I truly am.” Cocona continued, “The hardest thing I’ve ever faced was accepting and embracing myself… Now, I can finally say, ‘There’s nothing wrong with who I am inside.’” The performer also expressed gratitude toward their XG bandmates, XGALX founder and producer Simon (Jakops) , and their parents, adding that their support helped make the journey possible.

    "body": "4 min read NASA-JAXA XRISM Finds Elemental Bounty in Supernova Remnant For the first time, scientists have made a clear X-ray detection of chlorine and potassium in the wreckage of a star using data from the Japan-led XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) spacecraft. The Resolve instrument aboard XRISM , pronounced “crism,” discovered these elements in a supernova remnant called Cassiopeia A or Cas A, for short. The expanding cloud of debris is located about 11,000 light-years away in the northern constellation Cassiopeia. “This discovery helps illustrate how the deaths of stars and life on Earth are fundamentally linked,” said Toshiki Sato, an astrophysicist at Meiji University in Tokyo. “Stars appear to shimmer quietly in the night sky, but they actively forge materials that form planets and enable life as we know it. Now, thanks to XRISM, we have a better idea of when and how stars might make crucial, yet harder-to-find, elements.” A paper about the result published Dec. 4 in Nature Astronomy. Sato led the study with Kai Matsunaga and Hiroyuki Uchida, both at Kyoto University in Japan. JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) leads XRISM in collaboration with NASA, al…",
