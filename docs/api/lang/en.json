Dubbed “freak folk” at the time, the genre-bending opus was, in his words, “a snapshot of community,” where Brazilian-inspired tropicalismo, psych-folk and radical inclusivity collided. Recorded in home studios and retreats filled with friendships and free-spirited experimentation, Cripple Crow felt more like a collective effort than a solo project. Its debut at No. 24 on Billboard &#8216;s Independent Albums chart suggested a modest arrival, but its legacy has only grown in the years since. Ahead of its time in both sound and perspective, Cripple Crow brought Banhart’s dual Venezuelan-American heritage into sharp focus, serving as an early example of bilingual experimentation. In an era when U.S. indie music rarely acknowledged deep ties to Latin American traditions, the album broke the mold, drawing inspiration from legends like Venezuela’s Simón Díaz, Argentina’s Mercedes Sosa and Brazil’s Caetano Veloso. Its impact continues to echo in a new wave of bilingual, U.S.-born Latin artists…",

That day, the court heard two consolidated claims: HYBE’s request to confirm the termination of a shareholder agreement, and Min’s demand for payment under a put option (a contractual right to sell shares back). Positions between the parties remained sharply divided. The hearing revisited long-running flashpoints — allegations that HYBE’s new girl group copied NewJeans, clauses described by Min as “slave-like” non-compete terms, and claims of “forced album releases” targeting NewJeans. Jung questioned Min’s outside activities and possible breaches of contract, while Min countered, calling the narrative “fiction” and accusing the witness of “multiple false statements.” The courtroom confrontation stretched for almost five hours.

We got our first hint of more affordable flip phones when Motorola started to launch cheaper Razr entries, followed by offerings from brands like nubia and TECNO on the global market. But our prayers for a more affordable Galaxy Z Flip phone went unanswered. Now, Samsung has finally launched the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE alongside the more expensive Galaxy Z Flip 7 . However, after testing the Flip 7 FE for a week or so, I’m sad to say my prayers for a more affordable Z Flip that I can fully enjoy using haven’t been answered yet.",

In addition to code and methods improvements, the series also resulted in the NASA/Boeing Common Research Model ( https://commonresearchmodel.larc.nasa.gov/ ), an open-access, commercially-relevant aircraft geometry.

The original poster detailed their experience buying the most expensive Pixel out there, not being happy with it, returning it, and buying the Pixel 9a instead, and ending up much more content with the cheaper phone despite their (very tech-savvy) friends’ constant taunting about the 9a’s lower specs and cheaper build quality. That thread hit a chord for me because it’s something I’ve experienced time and again when buying or reviewing phones for Android Authority , as well as when talking about phone purchases with my friends and family. Everyone is just happier with the cheaper phones; it’s anecdotal evidence, sure, but looking for the absolute best Android phone is bound to end in misery and dissatisfaction.",

Last month, Google began testing a simpler Material You-based interface for Android Auto , featuring background colors that match your phone’s wallpaper. With this change, the background behind the media player for apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music was adapted to match the dominant colors of the wallpapers, upsetting users due to its bland appearance .

    "body": "If you’re in the market for a new tablet , HUAWEI hopes to lure you away from the usual choices of Apple and Samsung. The MatePad Pro and the MatePad 11.5 are two new tablets catering to power users and general consumers. So, should you buy them? And which one should you choose? Here are my thoughts. HUAWEI MatePad Pro 12.2 (2025) The HUAWEI MatePad Pro 2025 could almost be my favorite tablet without a few issues. First, let’s go through the specs because they are impressive. It has a 12.2-inch OLED display, and this is one of the best tablets I own for watching content. It offers 2,000 nits of peak brightness and features HUAWEI’s excellent sound tuning. This is probably one of the best-sounding tablets I’ve used in a long time. The tablet’s body is incredibly thin, making it ideal for traveling.",

The editor supports conditions, adds new actions and triggers, and just empowers more complicated automations. While some features aren’t yet working, you still have the option to go back to the old editor. Having a proper smart home means more than just installing some Wi-Fi lightbulbs, smart outlets, and security cameras. If you really want to get the most out of all that tech, you’re going to want to set up some automations, where one event triggers a bunch of other things to start happening in sequence — like maybe when someone rings your doorbell, you want the show you’re watching to automatically pause and the lights in your foyer to turn on. Getting that all configured properly, though, can be a huge undertaking — and that’s even assuming that all the automated stuff you’d like to do is supported at all. Thankfully, Google just announced that the Home app is receiving a major update to its automation editor, including adding in some new starter triggers.",

Despite that news, quite a few Pixel 10 owners share that their problems with Android Auto have yet to resolve. If you haven’t given it a shot yet, you really owe it to yourself to discover what Android Auto can do to transform your driving experience. But for as much as we love the platform and all the great apps available for use in our cars, it’s no secret that Auto has a regrettable reputation for being a wee bit temperamental, occasionally malfunctioning in unexpected ways. We’re seeing that right now with reports of music skipping , and a couple weeks back we also heard how new Pixel 10 owners were running into problems with screen freeze-ups. It’s taken a little while, but we finally have some news to share on that latter front. Following up in one of the initial threads reporting the bug in Google’s Android Auto support community , a Google Community Specialist shares word of the progress that’s been made:",

Called Pismis 24, this young star cluster resides in the core of the nearby Lobster Nebula, approximately 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve. Captured in infrared light by Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. The largest and most brilliant ones with the six-point diffraction spikes are the most massive stars in the cluster. Hundreds to thousands of smaller members of the cluster appear as white, yellow, and red, depending on their stellar type and the amount of dust enshrouding them. Webb also shows us tens of thousands of stars behind the cluster that are part of the Milky Way galaxy. Learn more about this star cluster. Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI",

As other brands continue to make their smartphones increasingly difficult to repair, it appears Google has gone the opposite direction with the Pixel 10 . The Pixel 10 Pro XL has now been fully disassembled in a new teardown video. This video reveals that Google had repairability in mind when designing the flagship phone. YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back at it again with another teardown, this time for the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Before the teardown even begins, JRE points out that Google released a 234-page repair manual for the device for free.

When buying a charger, make sure that the device you want to power it with is capable of meeting its listed needs. Google requires 35W of input to use the Pixelsnap Charger at full 25W output. Charging phones is finally exciting again! Well, maybe “exciting” is overselling it — and not so much “again,” we guess — but charging is absolutely having a moment. With magnetic Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 series, and fast 25W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Android users are getting in on that MagSafe fun and having a blast doing it. While new Pixel 10 owners have no shortage of options to turn to for their charging accessories, the allure of Google’s own Pixelsnap devices is easy to understand. Unfortunately, some users appear to be buying Pixelsnap Chargers without checking the power requirements first, and are understandably having a pretty frustrating time as a result.",

Phones like the Pixel 10 series have us all talking about wireless Qi2 25W support , and the rise of super-thin models like Apple’s new iPhone Air are forcing us to ask what kind of trade-offs we’re willing to accept. Today we’re looking at the power situation for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S26 series, and it might not be great news for all those phones.

On paper, it seems like an easy win: music in your ears, heart rate data in your fitness app. In practice, ear-based tracking is notoriously fickle. A little sweat, a loose fit, or the simple act of dropping into downward dog can turn your readings into gibberish.

    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding native step tracking to Health Connect, changing its function from just a data hub for other apps. This marks a significant shift, as Health Connect will now be able to collect its own data directly from the phone’s sensors. This could be the first step in turning Health Connect into a comprehensive health platform, though the feature isn’t fully working yet. If you want to improve your health, there’s no shortage of services you can use to track your health, fitness, and wellness metrics. Some options are better than others at tracking certain metrics, so many people mix and match to find the best solution. To simplify this for users, Google created Health Connect in 2022 to serve as a central hub for all this data. Currently, the service only facilitates data sharing between different health and fitness apps and doesn’t track any data on its own. That’s set to change, though, as Google is working on adding native step tracking support to Health Connect.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR The iPhone 17 series comes with a toggle to turn off PWM dimming, a method that lowers the display’s brightness by strobing it in short intervals. PWM dimming is known to cause eye strain, and disabling it eliminates the display’s flickering in low-light conditions. Chinese phones take the opposite approach by using an ultra-high PWM frequency. With the Pixel 10 Pro, Google has also increased the PWM frequency to 480Hz but it may not be enough. Among all the iPhone 17 models that Apple unveiled this week, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max grab the most limelight for their new design, improved cameras, and enhanced thermals. However, all new models come with an upgraded display, featuring parity in refresh rate across models, a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, and Ceramic Shield 2 with an anti-reflective coating. While Apple did not pass up the opportunity to boast about these upgrades, another meaningful change, left unacknowledged, has now surfaced. All iPhone 17 models reportedly come with a hidden setting to toggle PWM (pulse-width modulation) on or off. The setting is supposedly buried among Accessibility options in iOS 26 release cand…",

The widespread Studio Ghibli trend from earlier this year saw the internet painted with images recreated using ChatGPT in the style of Japanese artist Hayao Miyazaki. Lately, Google has been stirring up a similar storm of novel and somewhat wild creations with Nano Banana .

The ad isn’t Google’s strongest burn yet, but it’s a playful reminder of Pixel’s AI edge over Apple’s flagships. Apple just unveiled the iPhone 17 series , and Google is wasting no time pouncing on it. The company has released a new “Best Phones Forever” ad in an attempt to burn Apple. In this ongoing series, a smug Pixel banters with a clueless iPhone, only to show off a feature the iPhone still doesn’t have. However, this new ad, titled “Generation Gap,” doesn’t quite land with the same bite as Google’s previous entries.",

Shopping for a new smartphone can be seriously nerve-wracking, and while manufacturers throw plenty of specs at us, it can sometimes be really difficult to get objective numbers for making comparisons. That is a big reason why we’ve been so excited this year to see the debut of the EU’s new energy efficiency labels , providing important details about not just how power-efficient our phones are, but also how durable — and that includes the battery itself. Beyond just reporting how long users can expect a fully charged battery to last, the labels give shoppers an indication as to how many charging cycles they might hope to get out of their phone over the course of its useful life. And as we already saw, Samsung phones are seriously leading the pack there , claiming battery performance that endures through 2,000 charging cycles.

While Google typically publishes source code within 48 hours of a new release, it has been a week, breaking a long-standing precedent for the community. Google confirmed the code is coming “in the coming weeks,” but the situation has reignited concerns about the company’s commitment to open-sourcing Android. Last week, Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update , bringing the company’s long-awaited Material 3 Expressive design overhaul and other exciting features to Pixel users. If you want to try new Android features but don’t own a Pixel device, your best option is usually to install a custom ROM based on the open-source version of the operating system. Google typically publishes the source code for new Android versions within 1-2 days of release, allowing independent developers to quickly start porting the new changes to their custom ROMs. That hasn’t happened this time, though, leaving many developers to wonder if Google’s history of timely open source releases is over.

    "body": "Credit: Robert Triggs / Android Authority TL;DR Google has relaunched the Pixel Referral Program for the Pixel 10 series, giving users 10 codes to share. A referral code provides a 10% discount on a new Pixel phone for the buyer and gives the referrer a $50 store credit. The credits and discounts are valid until February 28, 2026, and can be stacked with other offers, with some exceptions. Google relaunched the Pixel Referral Program last year for the Pixel 9 series. Users can refer their friends and family to a new Pixel 9 phone with a 10% discount and receive $50 Play Store credit in return. With the iPhone 17 dominating headlines this week, Google wants to remind everyone that it too is in the flagship race, and bringing back the Pixel Referral Program with the new Pixel 10 series is a great way to do just that. As reported by 9to5Google , Google has refreshed the Pixel Referral Program with a new round of referral codes. Users get 10 “more” referral codes to share with others, allowing them to rack up to $500 in Google Store credit. People who use your code get 10% off the highest-value Pixel phone in their cart.",

Instead of dragging and dropping, you can double-tap a tile to select it and then tap its new position to move it. This method is more precise and avoids the awkward scrolling and accidental drops common with the old way. Google rolled out the Android 16 QPR1 update to Pixel devices last week, bringing the company’s new Material 3 Expressive design to the masses. The Quick Settings panel saw the biggest changes, not only in its design but also in its functionality. Notably, the tile editor screen has been completely revamped; tiles are now grouped into categories and feature one-click shortcuts for adding or removing them. Repositioning tiles still works the old-fashioned way: just long-press a tile, then drag and drop it into its new spot. However, Android 16 QPR1 also added a second, hidden method for moving tiles that makes organizing the Quick Settings panel much easier. Once you open the Quick Settings tile editor in Android 16 QPR1 or later, you can double-tap any tile to select it. This highlights the tile and changes the text at the top to read, “Tap to position tile…",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple upgraded the 12MP periscope zoom to a 48MP shooter on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. It’s the first time an iPhone lineup has had a high megapixel count all around. The Pro models are also getting a variety of video features, like ProRes RAW, 4K 120fps Dolby Vision, and genlock. The iPhone 17 series is here, with the official announcement taking place today during Apple’s launch event. Unlike previous years, the company made some big improvements in the hardware. One of the biggest upgrades is to the camera tech on the Pro models, helping the iPhone catch up to its Android competitors. Along with camera upgrades, Apple is also releasing a few new video features. With the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, Apple did something it has never done until now. It has given the device high-megapixel count cameras all around. Gone is the old 12MP, 5x zoom optical zoom sensor. That camera has been replaced by a 48MP, 4x optical zoom sensor with f/2.8 aperture. It joins the 48MP, f/1.78 primary sensor and 48MP, f/2.2 ultrawide lens.",
