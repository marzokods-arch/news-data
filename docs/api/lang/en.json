This all comes from a post on X where GameStop announced the historic trade, which it calls \"the most valuable single trade-in ever recorded\" at any GameStop location.

How to start the Forsaken Hollows in Elden Ring Nightreign You'll unlock a new room behind the Small Jar Merchant after you fulfill the unlock requirements (Image credit: FromSoftware) There are a couple of conditions you'll have to meet to start the new Forsaken Hollows expansion content for Nightreign.

You might think such a resplendent back catalog would mean publishers are tripping over each other to offer Gilbert the chance to make whatever he likes, but not so; he had to cancel his last project, a Zelda-inspired open world RPG , in part because he couldn't get the resources he needed. In an interview with Ars Technica , Gilbert talked about why the project was scrapped: “I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that.\" Although, Gilbert once described it as \"the game I always wanted to play,\" as our initial news piece about the RPG states, that dream apparently wasn't worth a decade of grueling work. As he told Ars Technica, \"it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\" This is typically where a publisher would step in, and it sounds like Gilbert tried to secure funding, but he said in the interview …",

The server farm next door has way more cash to burn.

In that same story we reported that Micron, the other big player in memory, is planning to ramp up production that won't be online until late 2028.

Sure, melee characters, like Wylder and Raider, are getting big buffs to related passive effects, but I personally have received a huge buff because you can now rename your relic presets. Nightreign has given players the ability to save a relic setup for a while now, and it's incredibly useful to tailor them for different bosses. I have Ironeye set up with a relic that gives his bow poison damage for the bosses weak to that specific element, for instance. Not every boss is weak to poison, however, so it's a good idea to have a few different presets ready. There was one problem though: You had no way of sorting your presets by anything other than the date you saved them, for some reason. The new patch fixes this problem and lets you just name them whatever you want. No longer will I have to frantically skim through each preset to figure out which one is for fire damage and which one is for frost. I can just name them \"fire\" and \"frost\".

Publisher Santa Ragione said in November that Valve declined to carry Horses because it contained \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione disputed that characterization, but an appeal was rejected and the ban stands. The Epic Games Store followed with its own ban on December 1, one day before Horses was set to launch.

But Katie, I hear you say, if a normal keyboard has all the keys you could ever want, what's the point getting rid of them in favour of a TKL board? Well, friend, it's all about real estate and maneuverability. And cash, of course. But isn't everything? Say you've spent all your cash on the best gaming PC and you're now stuck with a teeny tiny desk. A TKL board nets you more desk space so you can stack plates and coffee cups beside it to your heart's content, or whatever else you're draping over your battlestation. With the MSI Forge GK600, you're killing two birds with one stone: saving space on your desk while also protecting your dragon's hoard of gold. Let's get into what makes the Forge GK600 special and, of course, what doesn't. Sitting somewhere in the region of a 75-80% layout, the Forge GK600 takes up less space without sacrificing as much productivity as the super compact layout of something like the 60% NuPhy Air60 HE . Its dedicated navigation and direction keys aren't being swallowed up by the mass of other keys, so you don't need to fumble around for them, while the two-col…",

Not too long ago, Logitech revised its longstanding low-profile keyboard lineup with a new G915 X Lightspeed model and the cheaper G515 Lightspeed TKL option, both of which I've looked at in the past. Both of those keyboards were in the Swiss brand's more traditional wheelhouse, opting for a conventional low-profile switch, plus creature comforts such as solid build quality and fast wireless connectivity. The all-new G515 Rapid TKL isn't in that wheelhouse, though. Its switches are no longer standard low-profile mechanical ones, and instead are low-profile magnetic analogue ones. That means all the fun of rapid trigger and its clever software trickery into an already short and snappy travel. I'll get to those switches in a minute. As I mentioned a minute ago, this keyboard is an example of the Logitech-flavoured cake being given to you but not consumed, in that it sacrifices any form of wireless connectivity. Say goodbye to Lightspeed, chaps, as it isn't here, which is a real shame. At least it works plug-and-play, I suppose. Log…",

But what's really amazing is every single one of them feels completely distinct, fun to play, and truly super . I just wish Marvel Cosmic Invasion offered more for them all to do. In the vein of developer Tribute Games' last game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, this is an unabashedly old school side-scroller. Bad guys appear, you punch them until they're all gone, then you move a bit further right and more bad guys appear. Repeat until you reach a boss fight. Simple, nostalgic, satisfying.

There's been the update that overhauled fighters and rangers , the one that gave you six more talent points , and that one that let you turn its spiders into orbs . But more is yet to come. And it was set to come, originally, this autumn, as part of the game's fall 2025 pitstop on its roadmap. \"If you’ve checked out a calendar you may have also noticed that fall is quickly running out,\" Obsidian wrote in an update for fans on its Discord. You can probably guess what that means: \"Avowed will not be receiving a fall update.\" There is an upside, though. To compensate for its tardiness, Obsidian is replacing the fall update with a one-year anniversary update, due this February, which will include all the stuff originally slated for autumn and some extra gubbins, too, making it \"the biggest update for the game yet.\" And if you think Obsidian deigned to detail just what those bonus features will contain, well, you might not …",

Reportedly, the OpenAI chief has called for staff to be pulled from other projects, including advertising, AI agents, and its forthcoming personal assistant, Pulse, in order to spruce up ChatGPT. The team behind the inordinately popular chatbot will also have to attend a daily meeting to report on their progress, which I can only imagine takes place in a ready room not far from the bridge. Futuristic red and gold uniforms, optional. The recent release of Google's Gemini 3 has been very well-received , and monthly active Gemini users are already reported to have grown from 450 million in July to 650 million this autumn. The new iteration of Gemini looks to best ChatGPT in several key areas, including critical analysis, strategic reasoning, and overall performance.

As the company points out, \"at $35, a 1GB Raspberry Pi 4 costs the same as a 256MB Raspberry Pi 1 from 2012.\" But now prices are being raised.

This ain't no teeny tiny slider patty but a full quarter pounder. There's no details on pricing or a release date yet but what I can tell you now is that, yes, in theory you could still take this chunky gaming handheld on a plane (though, you would need to check ahead of time what restrictions on 100+ Wh batteries may be in place for your specific airline). However, it's not just the chip that's greedy; the Ayeneo Next II's TDP is 85 W in order to feed an impressive list of tech specs. To begin with, there's the 9.06-inch OLED panel that features 2400 × 1504 resolution and enjoys up to 1100 nits of brightness. This screen also offers variable refresh rates, including options for 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, and 165 Hz. But even such a luscious screen is still just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.

That thing has been taking an absolute beating over the last year. We've seen very visible effects of this with various memorable outages, but now we've also got some numbers to put to it, in the form of \"hyper-volumetric\" DDoS attacks. Giant content delivery network (CDN) Cloudflare has released some somewhat troubling stats and info regarding the past year of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These are essentially attacks that attempt to flood a target service with packets of data to overload and overwhelm it and prevent it from doing the work it's actually meant to be doing, such as providing an internet connection to customers or displaying webpages. According to Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are up 170% to 36.2 million in 2025 compared to 2024. To zoom in a little, the company says that in the third quarter of 2025, it \"mitigated an average of 3,780 DDoS attacks every hour.\" That's 63 DDoS attacks each minute, or about one every second. Not every DDoS attack is a noteworthy one, of course, but ther…",

And while gaming mouse docks are often disregarded as a novelty or even a gimmick, it's hard to deny their practicality. I mean, plugging in ? In 2025? Why waste my energy on something so tedious? Thankfully, the MSI Versa Pro Wireless gaming mouse and Mouse Dock Pro are all about the path of least resistance. Since the world is now moving into some strange, AI-fuelled Edo period I'm betting the use of gaming mouse docks will start to see a resurgence, too. Alright, better prep yourself for further laziness productivity rants as we get into why the MSI Versa Pro Wireless and Mouse Dock Pro is quickly becoming my new favorite gaming accessory duo. Aside from the huge, lit-up logo and RGB-studded side panels there's a certain sleek simplicity to the Versa Pro and Mouse Dock Pro.

Its system requirements are so detailed that you'll probably be able to figure out the exact setting you'll be using the game, long before you get a chance to install it. You can check them out for yourself via Hypixel Studio's news post on the matter. Let's start with the good stuff to begin with, just as Hypixel does: listing the expected performance, graphics preset, and screen resolution for the minimum, recommended, and 'streamer' requirements. Specifically, it's 30 fps at 1080p Low for minimum, 60 fps at 1080p High for recommended, and \"stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at 1440p\".

You don't really think about it when you've only got the valley to explore, as each of the biomes feel so close you don't need to make a massive journey to get where you need to go. However, the sheer size of the game now it has received three expansions, alongside all the unlockable biomes in the Dream Castle, means there's a lot more ground to cover. And frankly, running around on foot doesn't cut it. Of course, you can glide, but I don't keep on top of my stamina enough to constantly do that. Fortunately, the newest expansion, Wishblossom Ranch, has unleashed what I can only describe as the best method of transport for a game like this: horses. That's right, if you're someone who grew up wanting to be a princess and asking for a pony every Christmas, then Disney Dreamlight Valley has finally answered your wishes. Within the Wishblossom Ranch DLC you'll be able to befriend numerous horses too, rather than just being lumped with one. You'll have wild horses to customise and befriend, but most notably, three iconic Disney horses have been added: Maximus from Tangled, Khan from Mulan, and Pegasus fr…",

If you need a refresher, here's a rundown of all eight episodes. Episode 1: The End In the year 2077, cowboy actor Cooper Howard performs with his daughter Janey at a birthday party. When Cooper refuses to do a thumbs-up his daughter asks why, and he explains that in the Marines they were taught to measure mushroom clouds with their thumbs—if it was bigger than their thumb it wasn't worth running away. Moments later, while Cooper is inside getting a slice of birthday cake, his daughter holds up her thumb to the smoke on the horizon. 219 years later, Lucy Maclean is convincing the council of Vault 33 to let her be the bride in an upcoming trade with their neighbors Vault 32. At the wedding her father Hank, who is the Overseer and a trade from Vault 31 himself, gives a speech explaining radiation levels on the surface are dropping to the point that Lucy and her new husband Monty's children will be able to recolonize the surface. \"I must admit…",

A breakdown of the ownership between these parties wasn't given at the time, but as it turns out, one is committing significantly more cash than the others. According to the Wall Street Journal , the PIF will own 93.4 percent of EA—a gargantuan amount that renders the other stakeholders insignificant by comparison. Silver Lake and Affinity Partners are set to own 5.5% and 1.1%, both of whom PIF is also a \"significant investor\" in. In other words, if the buyout passes regulatory and shareholder approvals, the PIF will effectively own EA. The report lists some other finer details about the transaction, now public thanks to a filing with Brazil's antitrust regulator. $36.4 billion of the $55 billion cost will be funded in equity, while the remaining $20 billion will debt.

The Forsaken Hollows has more in it than FromSoft originally let on. Sure, you can play the new supportive scholar character or the aggressive nun with the hammer, but there's also new locations coming to the original Limveld map and a new shifting earth event that brings you to what is effectively an entirely separate landmass. For a $15 DLC, that's quite a lot—and that's not counting all the new items and monsters we haven't seen yet. I'm still crossing my fingers that we get those backhand blades . Here are the Elden Ring Nightreign Forsaken Hollows release times for each region. Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows release date and time The Forsaken Hollows will launch at the same time around the world, but that means some regions will be able to drop into The Forsaken Hollows on December 3 , while the others will need to wait until December 4.

It's a formula that took a while to cotton on outside of Japan: it didn't really land as a big commercial success in the west until 2015's Yakuza 0. And that game landed loudly, despite making no overt compromises for western audiences. But now that western audiences are paying attention, will Ryu Ga Gotoku indulge them more? It seems unlikely, according to a new Automaton interview with three RGG Studio big wigs. Asked whether the studio might abandon its credo of \"making what feels true to RGG Studio\" in the event that their games became huge global concerns, series executive producer Yokoyama Masayoshi was unequivocal. \"No, it won’t,\" he said. \"If we really wanted to make a game for overseas audiences, it would obviously be better to make a foreign protagonist and set the story overseas.

But in the 10 years since Shovel Knight first appeared, developer Yacht Club Games has struggled to produce a full-on follow-up hit, and in a new interview with Bloomberg , studio founder Cris Velasco says it will be in serious trouble if its next game isn't a success. That 'next game' would be Mina the Hollower , a sort of gothic Link's Awakening that was revealed to the world in 2022 . \"It’s make-or-break for sure,\" Velasco said. \"If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good.\" Development of Mina the Hollower has been troubled, according to the interview. The game was proposed in 2019 and work began in earnest in early 2020, when Yacht Club split into two teams, one for the full-on Shovel Knight sequel—that 3D project we heard about back in 2020, apparently—and the other to handle Mina the Hollower, which was intended to be a sma…",

The OED defines \"rage bait\" thusly: \"Online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media account.\" So essentially the manipulative tactics deployed online by many unscrupulous publishers in order to get you mad, get you clicking, and get yo…",

Agent 47's beautiful, barcoded bald head has become one of the industry's icons, with the series' growth into its own identity truly impressive: from the early days where it was a more traditional 3D action game with cool ways to kill people, to the lightbulb moment of Blood Money's flexibility, to the sprawling sandbox extravaganza of the most recent trilogy (and not to forget false starts like Absolution). That trilogy, now all bound-up as Hitman: World of Assassination, has a new upcoming collaboration with Eminem. This is another area where IO has expanded cleverly: choosing celebrities that are happy to become in-game \"elusive targets\" and building missions around their personae. Hitman is never going to be Fortnite, but these collabs make enormous sense and sprinkle a little something different (as well as stardust) around every so often. Next up for the World of Assassination is a co-op mode, which has yet to be given a release date, though you'd expect it to be well after the March 2026 release of 007 First Light. \"I would say [Bond] is probably the…",

The game's been out for eight years, after all, and if nobody's escaped yet, well, nobody's ever going to.
