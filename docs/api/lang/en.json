What I do is ask myself a series of questions that help me pick the right phone — with the right specs, at the right price, and at the right time. This makes me feel like I’m in control of the entire process instead of being swayed by emotion, which, in my opinion, is usually a recipe for disaster.",

In an August interview with Billboard , the group’s manager Tyler Childs hinted that Australia was already in their sights. “There are a lot of different options,” he said. “Certainly Europe, Australia, Asia and then definitely coming back to North America next year. What shape does that take? It’s going to be arenas again, and we want to go to markets that haven’t been repeated.” All nine members of the Wu will be onstage—RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, Ghostface Killah, U-God, Masta Killa and Cappadonna—making this a rare and final chance for…",

The Pixel 9a or a Pixel 9 or 9 Pro XL (if discounted) may be a better bargain, depending on your priorities. Google started selling refurbished Pixel phones about a year ago , starting with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7. A few weeks ago, it dropped the aging Pixel 6 — currently guaranteed OS updates through October 2026 — from the rotation. Now, Google’s added a newer old phone to its refurb offerings: the Pixel 8 is back on the Google Store, starting at $489. 9to5Google spotted today that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have joined the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, and Pixel 7a on Google’s Certified Refurbished storefront. The 128-gig Pixel 8 goes for $489, down from its $699 MSRP; the 256-gig model is $539. As of publication, the refurbished 8 Pro is only available with 128 gigabytes of storage for $699, down from $999.",

    "body": "TL;DR Google is adding GPU acceleration for graphical Linux apps to Android’s Terminal app, but the feature is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10. This feature relies on Gfxstream, a library that forwards graphics API calls from the guest Linux virtual machine to the host Android device’s GPU for accelerated rendering. Though the feature is live for Pixel 10 users in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3, it’s still buggy and doesn’t yet offer the near-native performance expected. Back in March, Google introduced the Linux Terminal app to Android, which uses virtualization to run full-fledged Linux programs on Android devices. While the initial release only supported command-line apps, Google is addressing that limitation in the upcoming Android 16 QPR2 update. Even though Android 16 QPR2 will add support for graphical desktop Linux apps , they will run poorly on most Android devices. This is because the Linux Terminal app currently relies on a software-based renderer called Lavapipe. Lavapipe uses the device’s CPU for complex calculations and rasterization (the process of converting vector graphics into pixels) — tasks that the device’s GPU can perform much more quickly and efficiently.",

This is because the feature requires support for “non-protected” virtual machines, which Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip does not offer. As a result, users wanting to run desktop Linux apps on Android must currently use a device with a Google, MediaTek, or Samsung chip. When Qualcomm unveiled its new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 last month, the question on most people’s minds was: “How well does it perform?” The answer, it turns out, is incredibly well — at least in benchmarks . Qualcomm has always done a great job at building powerful, yet efficient, mobile processors, but it’s hard to find real-world tasks that can really push those processors to their limits. That’s because most Android apps are built for the lowest common denominator — cheap devices with vastly slower processors than flagship phones. On the other hand, many Linux apps are built for people with powerful workstations, as Linux is popular among power users and developers.",

Update: October 20, 2025 (12:56 PM ET): A Google spokesperson has confirmed to Android Authority that Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 will be available again this week. Original article: October 16, 2025 (4:29 PM ET): Yesterday, Google released the third and final beta of Android 16 QPR2 for eligible Pixel devices. This update resolves several issues, such as home screen shortcuts appearing as gray circles, selected themes not being applied on the first attempt, and Google Play System updates failing to install. If you waited on installing Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3 , it looks like you’ll have to continue waiting. Google may have pulled the update.",

Smart ring maker Oura introduced stress tracking to its platform in 2023. Today, the company announced that it’s building on these shorter-term stress features with an upcoming tool that’s meant to give you insight into how your body is handling stress over time. Oura’s also taking the first steps to develop features that’ll warn users when their blood pressure may be creeping up. In a press release , Oura detailed a busy end to the year. Over the next few weeks, Oura will be rolling out a new Cumulative Stress feature, improvements to its Cycle Insights, and a major update to its app. It’s also kicking off a study to develop a feature it’s calling Blood Pressure Profile, which combine trends measured by Oura Ring wearables with questionnaire responses to give users a rough idea of whether their blood pressure may be cause for concern.",

A new video uploaded over the weekend finally shows the device in action, and despite the affordable price, it looks like it will be capable of much more than just DS games.

At first, I was interested to see what Google could do and the potential that more stock Android smartphones could offer.

This isn’t due to the hardware itself or even Google as a company, but rather Google’s position as the primary developer of Android.",

The screen appeared after they updated their Google TV Home app. This is the first instance of Gemini for TV running on a device beyond TCL’s premier televisions. There’s still no word on when Gemini for TV will roll out to Google’s own devices. In September, Google began rolling out Gemini to Google TV products, as promised in May, but initially, only one device received the next-generation assistant. Now, it seems that support for additional devices may be imminent. A Reddit user, u/Proshis_Saha_Swopna , discovered the Gemini setup screen on their Sony Bravia TV running Android TV 14 after updating the Google TV Home app via the Play Store.",

The screen recorder has been around for a couple of years now, but it’s still fairly basic. Despite receiving a few new features in recent years, it lacks many quality-of-life improvements found in other operating systems. Now, in preparation for Android coming to PCs , Google is working on a major upgrade to the feature. Here’s an early look. You’re reading the Authority Insights Newsletter , a weekly newsletter that reveals some new facet of Android that hasn’t been reported on anywhere else. If you’re looking for the latest scoops, the hottest leaks, and breaking news on Google’s Android operating system and other mobile tech topics, then we’ve got you covered.",

Not a smooth transition At its core, AIO Launcher is unlike any other home screen on the market. It’s decidedly different from traditional products like Nova Launcher and Smart Launcher, but I can’t quite compare it to other niche launchers.

The update will bring a bunch of new features , including, OnePlus says, enhancements to its Parallel Processing, which is meant to make opening and switching apps feel faster. In a video showcasing the new update, OnePlus compared the app switching experience in OxygenOS to Samsung’s One UI — but the demo seemed intentionally dishonest. As flagged by uyagoda_ on Threads, a split-screen pitting OxygenOS 16 against Samsung One UI (labeled “Other Flagship UI”) appears to show a Samsung phone hanging as a game loads while the OnePlus phone next to it continued to fly through cycling in and out of various apps. At a glance, it looks bad for Samsung, but on closer inspection, the One UI hiccup was pretty clearly user error.",

The model numbers are PM-1521-BV, PM-1522-BV, and PM-1523-BV. These model numbers are likely for the phone and its variants rather than three different models. There was a time when the fate of the Xperia line felt like it was up in the air, as it seemed the company was readying an exit from the mobile phone sector. However, Sony’s CFO confirmed that the firm still plans to support Xperia phones. Qualcomm also mentioned Sony as one of the manufacturers that will be taking advantage of its latest processor. As further proof that the Xperia line continues on, the company’s next Android flagship was recently spotted on a database. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

A few app crashes, sure, but most of the time Google still manages to give us a largely functional piece of software.
