The annual listener recap attracted widespread news coverage that spanned the mainstream press ( The New York Times , USA Today ), the business press ( Fast Company , Forbes ), the tech press ( Mashable , PC Mag ) and local press ( Peoria Journal Star , Cincinnati Enquirer ). For its part, Spotify announced the launch of Wrapped with a slew of blog posts and a pre-release press conference. Even before that, articles about Wrapped’s launch began appearing in late November by publications eager to tap into listeners’ anticipation. &nbsp; Regardless of how Spotify users learned of Wrapped — the media attention, social media chatter or seeing it when they opened their Spotify app on Wednesday (Dec. 3) — they took part in a record-setting launch. Within approximately the first 24 hours, Wrapped drew more than 200 million engaged users, up 19% from the previous year, the company revealed on Thursday (Dec. 4). In 2024, Wrapped needed 62 hours to meet the 200 million user mark. What&#8217;s more, the number of times Spotify users shared their Wrapped experiences surpassed 500 million in 24 hours,…",

    "body": "TL;DR Google settled a lawsuit over monopolizing Android app distribution for $700 million in 2023. Payouts should start this spring, with affected users eligible for at least $2 via Venmo or PayPal. Payouts will mostly be automatic, but users who can’t receive automatic payments have other options. A couple of years ago, Google settled a lawsuit brought by US states that accused the company of holding an illegal monopoly on Android app distribution, using its position to overcharge users for apps and in-app purchases. Despite Google denying wrongdoing, that settlement is set to pay out $700 million this spring. If you’re owed a cut, you probably don’t have to do much to get it. As reported today by ZDNET , settlement payments are on track to be distributed soon after a fairness hearing scheduled for April 30 of next year. Owners of Google accounts in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands who made purchases on the Play Store between 2016 and 2023 are included in the settlement. Payments should be distributed automatically.",

Gemini is slowly replacing Google Assistant throughout Google’s smart home ecosystem, initially for beta testers enrolled in an early access program. The first wave of the Gemini for Home rollout opened up on October 28 for users signed up for early access in the US. However, after that initial wave, most users appeared to be left waiting for entry. We asked readers in early November if they gained access to the Gemini for Home beta in a poll , and 88% of respondents said they hadn’t. If you’re waiting for access, there’s good news — Google appears to be letting more people into the Gemini for Home beta in what could be the second wave of the rollout. We’ve heard from multiple users who gained access to Gemini for Home recently, and some of Android Authority’s devices were upgraded to Gemini as well.",

The filings follow Starlink’s growing telecom activity, including its T-Mobile satellite partnership and recent acquisition of terrestrial spectrum from EchoStar. None of this is too surprising, as Musk had previously stated that Starlink may eventually offer full cellular service, though he suggested it was likely a ways off at the time. Starlink has been transforming the way people connect to the internet for over six years now, and during that time the company has grown significantly in both subscribers and ambition. It initially focused on satellite ISP services, but in 2022 it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to provide satellite features for cellular subscribers as well. This collaboration eventually led to T-Satellite by Starlink , which offers limited connectivity in areas where cellular towers are unavailable. As first spotted by PC Mag , it now appears that a new trademark suggests Starlink’s mobile ambitions likely extend far beyond this. Don’t …",

At the time, OnePlus stated that it was “refining the thermal curve” and has since issued an update to the handset, claiming it has addressed the problem. So we’ve updated our handset and re-run the tests to find out. Before conducting the stress tests, we re-ran the OnePlus 15 through GeekBench 6 to verify that the phone’s overall performance profile hadn’t changed. The good news is that CPU performance remains just as good, if not marginally better (though a 1.5% to 2% improvement is within the margin of error) than before the update. Flicking on the phone’s performance mode is actually closer to 5% faster in multi-core.",

Early testing showed incompatibility issues between the two devices, but users confirm the connection now works seamlessly.

One of the new social gaming features introduced with the Nintendo Switch 2 is GameChat, which essentially lets you join a group video call where everyone shares their game screen and camera feed. GameChat lets you see and chat with friends even if they’re playing different games, but it requires external hardware to show your face, as the Switch 2 lacks a built-in camera. Nintendo says the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, but in our early testing, we found that it wasn’t compatible with the Pixel’s USB webcam mode. Fortunately, that’s no longer the case.",

One of the more interesting changes is actually a reversal of something added in Android 16 QPR1 this past September. As part of the Material 3 Expressive interface added to Pixel phones with that update, one of the bigger UI tweaks was a blur effect in the app drawer and Quick Settings panel. I don’t mind it, but it’s something a lot of Pixel users have wanted Google to get rid of.",

I pinged a few members of the SoundGuys crew and checked in with our own Rita El Khoury, whose gadget tastes often match my own.

Recent leaks point to redesigned Clock, Calculator, and Internet apps. The update brings a good dose of colors and 3D neomorphic effects. Samsung’s One UI 8.5 has already been spoiled by extensive leaks, even before the official release or even a beta rollout. Based on these leaks, we know that Samsung is planning a significant visual overhaul with the update, including redesigned menus and transparency features seemingly inspired by Apple’s latest iOS 26 update. In addition, Samsung is also expected to enhance app icons with 3D effects that might remind you of the bygone Touchwiz era . However, a more recent leak suggests these traits may not be limited just to app icons. With One UI 8.5, Samsung could add 3D neomorphic effects to various system apps. A series of recent leaks already indicated these changes are coming to the Clock, Calculator, and the Samsung Internet browser.",

The narrow waterway separating Peninsular Malaysia from the Indonesian island of Sumatra sits so close to the equator that the Coriolis effect is usually too weak to allow storms to rotate enough to organize into cyclones. But on November 25, 2025, meteorologists watched as a tropical depression intensified into Cyclone Senyar—just the second documented case of a tropical cyclone forming in the strait. Hemmed in by land on both sides, Senyar made landfall in Sumatra later that day as it made a U-turn and headed east toward Malaysia. As the slow-moving storm passed over Sumatra’s mountainous terrain, it dropped nearly 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in many areas, according to satellite-based estimates from NASA’s Global Precipitation Me…",

Founder Nicholas Merrill says the goal is to break the link between a person’s phone identity and their personal data.

Nicholas Merrill is best known for fighting an FBI surveillance order for more than a decade. He has now launched Phreeli, a new mobile carrier that lets you sign up with nothing more than your ZIP code. As Wired reports, Phreeli (pronounced like ‘freely’) runs on T-Mobile’s network, but the real headline is what it refuses to collect. The company doesn’t ask for your name, address, or any other information that could be linked to your phone number. Merrill states that the level of anonymity is legal in every US state, and the ZIP code is provided solely for tax purposes.",

The always-on display is apparently toggling off and on briefly under some circumstances. We’ve asked Google for more info. December’s Pixel update landed earlier this week with bug fixes in tow for Pixel 6 phones and newer. The changelog is almost entirely fixes: fixes for audio crashes, fixes for battery reporting errors , fixes for emergency calling — on and on. According to reports on social media, though, it’s also causing a new bug that’s driving some users up the wall. A post by user subferno on the Pixel subreddit says that, since installing the December update, their Pixel 10 Pro’s always-on display has exhibited a “hard flicker,” apparently toggling on and off for a split second whenever it refreshes. Other users are having similar problems, too.",

This setting allows the network to use a single device’s location data to find lost items, improving reliability in low-traffic areas. The new screen simplifies the options and explicitly warns that the default setting may make it harder to locate items in remote places. For most Android users, the best item tracking option is Google’s Find Hub , as it works on almost every Android device. There are even a variety of compatible Bluetooth trackers you can use to locate your items. Unfortunately, Find Hub can have trouble locating items in some areas due to its default configuration. Out of the box, the network requires multiple Android devices to detect an item before reporting its location, limiting reliability in low-traffic areas. While it looks unlikely that Google will reverse this decision soon, the company is starting to nudge users to enable the network’s more reliable tracking setting.

Reports span several models, but others say theirs still works, so the issue isn’t universal. Google hasn’t documented any changes to One-Handed Mode; we’ve reached out to the company for comment. A handful of Pixel owners claim that the December Pixel update may have inadvertently broken one of the commonly used gestures. Several online reports claim that the notification shade can no longer be pulled down once One-Handed Mode is active, a feature that was working normally before the latest update. The first report appeared on Google’s Pixel Support page , where a Pixel 9 Pro owner said they were suddenly unable to open the notification panel after triggering One-Handed Mode. Similar complaints then surfaced on Reddit here and here , with users on devices ranging from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro XL reporting that the same gesture no longer works after the update.",

With the first quarterly release of Android 16 , Google completely revamped the operating system’s UI to introduce its new Material 3 Expressive design language. From the notification panel to the Settings app to the lock screen and beyond, Google redesigned nearly every system interface visible to the user. However, Android is a huge OS, so Google missed a few parts during the initial overhaul, such as the Package Installer that handles sideloading apps. With Android’s latest update, the Package Installer has finally received its Material 3 Expressive redesign, too.

The Resolve instrument aboard XRISM , pronounced “crism,” discovered these elements in a supernova remnant called Cassiopeia A or Cas A, for short. The expanding cloud of debris is located about 11,000 light-years away in the northern constellation Cassiopeia. “This discovery helps illustrate how the deaths of stars and life on Earth are fundamentally linked,” said Toshiki Sato, an astrophysicist at Meiji University in Tokyo. “Stars appear to shimmer quietly in the night sky, but they actively forge materials that form planets and enable life as we know it. Now, thanks to XRISM, we have a better idea of when and how stars might make crucial, yet harder-to-find, elements.” A paper about the result published Dec. 4 in Nature Astronomy.

It primarily spreads through APKs distributed via unmoderated channels such as messaging platforms. Once installed, the malware enables hackers to remotely control your device and hide their activities behind fake blank or update screens. Just last week, we learned about a banking malware that exploits accessibility settings on Android to steal your bank credentials in the background. Now, we’re looking at another malware that not only enables remote attacks on Android devices but is distributed freely among hackers as part of a subscription service. Researchers at Cleafy , an online fraud prevention firm, have discovered (via MalwareBytes ) a new Android trojanware dubbed “Albiriox.” Just like Sturnus, which we learned about last week, Albiriox is distributed through infected or dummy APKs by luring potential targets into believing they are downloading actual apps. One of the ways that hackers use to achieve that is by creating fake replicas of Google Play Store listings, making users believe they are downloading apps from secure sources when they are actually not. …",

Valve has funded projects such as Fex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Fex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X.

We’ve found clear code evidence suggesting Google is developing double-pinch and wrist-turn gestures for its smartwatches. Wrist gestures used to be a thing up until Wear OS 3, and Google’s version of double-pinch is identical to what Apple and Samsung offer on their respective watches. Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

As with the first quarterly update, there is a significant emphasis on visual improvements . The Android QPR2 brings support for force-theming icons, a forced dark mode for apps that don’t inherently support it, additional accessibility features for better screen visibility, and more. One more feature that may have flown under the radar is the improvements the update brings to Circle to Search, and particularly how it handles translations.

Meta has wielded its financial might to stock up talent in the technology industry, spending millions on poaching AI engineers, researchers, and executives from competitors like Apple and OpenAI. Now, it’s using that strategy to nab Apple’s vice president of human interface design, who led the company’s software design efforts for a decade. The Apple design executive, Alan Dye, will reportedly join Meta on December 31, according to a Bloomberg report. It comes at a time when Meta’s wearable devices face significant threats, with Google and Samsung building out headsets and smart glasses under the Android XR platform to challenge the Quest, Ray-Ban Meta, and Oakley Meta lines.",
