    "body": "Morgan Wallen ’s I&#8217;m the Problem leads Billboard &#8216;s Top Country Albums chart (dated Feb. 14) for the 37th nonconsecutive week. This ups Wallen&#8217;s career tally of weeks at No. 1 to 223, allowing him to extend his lead as the artist with the most weeks at No. 1 in the chart&#8217;s 62-year history.

Top Country Albums originated as Hot Country Albums in the Jan. 11, 1964 issue of Billboard . Johnny Cash ’s Ring of Fire (The Best of Johnny Cash) headed the inaugural chart. The compilation was well-timed: “Ring of Fire” had headed Hot Country Songs for seven weeks the previous summer and had crossed over to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The chart was named Hot Country LP’s from 1968 to 1984, when vinyl LPs were king. Twenty-one artists have logged 50 or more weeks at No. 1 on Top Country Albums.
