Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere isn’t a traditional cradle-to-grave biopic &#8212; for one thing, its protagonist is, thankfully, still very much with us. It’s part of a subgenre of biopics which focuses on one fateful period in an artist’s life. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is set in the period following Springsteen’s 1980 commercial breakthrough, The River (which spawned his first true pop smash, “Hungry Heart”) where the artist felt compelled to make a low-key, acoustic album, Nebraska .

Wicked received 10 Oscar nominations on Jan. 23, 2025, including nods for both of its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande . It won two awards at the Oscars ceremony on March 2, 2025 — best costume design and best production design. Both Wicked and Wicked: For Good were directed by Jon M.

In a new interview with Clash , Williams said she wants the tour to be a place where every fan can “feel welcome to the party,” but added that this commitment also requires her to take a public stance about who she does not want in the room. “I don’t want racists around, and I don’t want sexist people around, and I don’t want people there who think that trans people are a burden,” she said. “I think that’s a hard line for me now.” Williams explained that she hopes anyone holding those beliefs will “walk in the door and realise that the gang’s all here, all banded together around something positive,” adding: “All are welcome if you believe all should be welcome… If you don’t believe that, you’re not welcome.” Her upcoming tour — which supports her latest solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — The North American leg kicks off on March 28 in Atla…",

Azalea’s last studio album, The End of an Era , arrived in 2021 and marked a personal milestone, intended as a closing chapter before a pivot to new creative paths. Her 2014 debut, The New Classic , made a global impact with the Billboard No. 1 single “Fancy” and established her as one of the most commercially successful Australian rappers of the decade.

Crater rims are vital landmarks for planetary science and navigation. Yet detecting them in real imagery is tough, with shadows, lighting shifts, and broken edges obscuring their shape. This project invites you to develop methods that can reliably fit ellipses to crater rims, helping advance future space exploration. In the pursuit of next generation, terrain-based optical navigation, NASA is developing a system that will use a visible-light camera on a spacecraft to capture orbital images of lunar terrain and process the imagery to: detect the crater rims in the images, identify the craters from a catalog, and estimate the camera/vehicle position based on the identified craters. The focus of this project is the crater detection process. Natural imagery varies significantly in lighting and will impact the completeness of crater rims in the images.
