Even back then, when game studios were a fraction of the size of today's behemoths making Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed, he wanted to work with a smaller team, where his own ideas could shine through. \"Making games, money aside, it's fun, and it needs to be fun to make something fun,\" he told me over coffee in Tokyo in late September. \"With a smaller group of people, you've got all the essential elements to make a game, and they've all got their own special abilities. One is great at art, another is great at programming. And to share the vision, it's a lot less work.\" With his John Lennon glasses and a tweed newsboy cap corralling graying sideburns, Kimura is the Platonic ideal of an elder statesman indie dev. His games from the early 2000s, including controversial survival horror Rule of Rose and kissing-based life sim Chulip , have the sort of cult appeal that inspires retrospective YouTube essays and Let's Plays.

    "body": "Since Battlefield 6's first multiplayer beta, a contingent of players have held firmly to a fundamental criticism: The maps are too damn small. Ensuing weeks of heated debate have seen some longtime Battlefield veterans venting frustration with BF6's tightly-corseted combat corridors, while others have insisted those of us longing for broader battlezones are suffering from nostalgia poisoning. Thanks to the efforts of community cartographic analysts, however, we now have a more definitive assessment of whether BF6's maps are up to scale. Redditors ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC painstakingly compared the playable areas of Battlefield maps from Battlefield 3 forwards, and yes—based on their measurements, the map selection in BF 6 is more cramped than in previous games. (Image credit: /u/ClaraTheRed and /u/PENGUINonPC) To assess the dimensions and playable areas of Battlefield's maps, ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC devised their own process of recording the distances from a player's position to that map's HQ and control points. Using those measurements, they resized images of the overhead view of each in-game map until they shared a scale of 1 pixel per meter. \"There's always the risk of …",

How do I react? Immediately pop a shield recharger of course. Then I take one more shot to the body and die. Turns out I've been healing all wrong in Arc Raiders, and in case you have to, let's talk about it. If you play other shooters with a shield/health system, especially battle royales like Fortnite or Apex Legends, you might assume shields are basically a second health bar, but they work differently in Arc Raiders: shields only mitigate damage, and not very much of it. You can see how much damage they mitigate when you hover over them. A basic Light Shield blocks 40% damage until it's broken. For Medium Shields, it's 42.5%, and for Heavy Shields it's 52.5%—so at best, you're only ever cutting damage in half. That's why HP is really where it's at. If it drops to zero, you're donezo no matter what. And since you're always losing some HP no matter the damage source, a full shield won't help much when your HP is low.

Reports of Arc Raiders server issues began popping up on Reddit in the early afternoon (Eastern time) on November 2, as eager players ran headlong into login and matchmaking issues. The cause of the outage was no great mystery: WE PEAKED AND NOW THE ARC BROKE THE SERVERS! from r/ArcRaiders Evidence of the servers struggle can be seen on SteamDB , where a high of nearly 338,000 concurrent players was achieved before sudden palpitations threw everything into disarray.

    "body": "Memory has been in a weird spot as of late. The increased demands presented by the rise of AI , plus the expansion of data centres, stock shortages, and the winding down of DDR4 have all left the typical gamer caught out in the rain. Adding to this, Samsung was reportedly supposed to have finalised memory price contracts by the end of October. It now seemingly won't have them finalised until the middle of November, according to industry sources speaking to Digitimes . Samsung's delaying of these contract quotes, and communicating the lack of stock to customers, reportedly caused a 25% surge in the price of DDR in a single week. SK Hynix and Micron are among other manufacturers that are also said to be not giving any firm numbers to clients. Not being transparent about the price of memory can contribute to surging prices and push companies to pay higher rates to secure the same supply they were otherwise operating with. Just last week, 2 GB DDR4-3200 modules averaged $25 , and we've seen a similar rise across the board. This unwillingness to lock in prices is likely linked to the sudden demand/memory shortage, and Digitimes reports that Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are all likely …",

In a post on X discussing Avalanche Studios' cancelled game Contraband , Cristofer Sundberg stated that Swedish studio would be unlikely to make a fifth Just Cause game due to the fact that the majority of the series' key creatives have since departed the studio. Sundberg, who left Avalanche Studios in 2019, said that Just Cause 5 'would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.\" Now, it doesn't immediately follow that changes in personnel means a developer will stop iterating upon a particular series. None of Doom's original creators still work at id Software, for example, but the studio keeps making great spins on its world-changing FPS. Sundberg, however, believes that the will to make Just Cause games left with the series' key creators, a problem he says became evident during the creation of Just Cause 4 .

Consider Dragon Age; born as a CRPG, forced to live through little chips and nicks that turned it into a third-person action game with RPG elements. I mean, I get it on paper. Action games have more mainstream appeal, so sayeth industry wisdom. If you want huge, big-budget successes, the best way to spoil those dreams is to brain newcomers over the dome with a character sheet, or gross them out with an orb-based skill tree that looks more like a trypophobia trigger than a UI element. But as we've gone on, I'm growing less and less convinced that this idea—that we simply cannot handle anything more difficult, or it'll hurt our walnut gamer brains—was ever true. At the very least, it's not true right now. Complexity, turning games into the sea Before I get stuck in, I want to define what I mean by \"crunch\", which is a TTRPG term I'm cribbing for this article about vi…",

In this mission, you're tasked by Tian Wen with investigating whether one of her caches in the Buried City has been tampered with. Thankfully, it's an outskirt location, so you don't have to worry about venturing into town to contend with patrolling Arcs or loot-hungry players. All that said, here's how to complete Marked for Death in Arc Raiders. Reach Su Durante Warehouses in the Outskirts in Buried City The Su Durante Warhouses are in the north of Buried City (Image credit: Embark Studios) Your first step in the Marked for Death quest is making your way to the Su Durante Warehouses in the north of the Buried City. This is a fairly easy location to get to, depending on your spawn, but since it's on the outskirts rather than in the centre, you can expect far fewer players and Arcs.

For another, the buyout came from a group of investors that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners—founded by Donald Trump's son in law Jared Kushner. LGBT people and women more generally face repression in Saudi Arabia , while Kushner, of course, has strong ties to a Trump administration which has made attacking LGBT rights a cornerstone of its platform. The presence of such conservative elements in the EA buyout has had more than a few Sims fans worried that the state's involvement in EA might lead to a clampdown on the series' more diverse elements. That'd be a terrible idea for a lot of obvious, moral reasons, but one OG Sims designer (via FRVR ) says it would be \"existential for the business.\" Charles London, who worked as art director on The Sims 1 and creative director on The Sims 2, said that representing same-sex relationships in the earlier games was \"everything\" for the series. \"I think it's existential for the business, right?

The same can't be said for the game now though, and having spent the weekend running for my life and screaming over proximity chat, REPO really lives up to its horror tag. The 10 new monsters launched as part of this update span all three \"levels\". So, you've got the less-intimidating level one beasts like the new Tick, which resembles a chunky beige bug with big black eyes, or Elsa the dog who is fairly harmless until she takes damage. But then REPO massively ramps up the fear factor by throwing in something horrifying like the Birthday Boy, a character which roams the level placing balloons—which again, seems harmless. But if you're found around popped balloons, or you're responsible for popping them, he will unleash hell. It's a real mixed bag, and with the existing roster of monsters it's quite refreshing to see some new characters pop up rather than cycling through the same bunch. However, one of REPO's newest addition…",

In a Steam discussion , user Adam posted that it's \"hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game.\" This was apparently posted in response to the initial round of layoffs, but other users began to debate whether developers who'd had their jobs working on Possessor(s) cut would see a return for their efforts. \"I have no intention of giving money to a company that thanked them for that work by kickin…",

You'll have to ascend to three of the tallest points in Dam Battlegrounds, Spaceport, and Buried City, and while one of these is very simple, the other two require a bit more work, including using a zipline gadget for the final one. Here's how to complete Eyes in the Sky. On Dam Battlegrounds, install a LiDAR Scanner on top of the Control Tower Image 1 of 2 Climb to the top of the Control Tower using the liftshaft you can breach open (Image credit: Embark Studios) Image 2 of 2 Place the scanner at the prompted tripod on the east corner of the roof (Image credit: Embark Studios) The first LiDAR Scanner you have to place is at the top of the Control Tower, just south of the centre of Dam Battlegrounds.

Which sounds like it'd be pretty tough, given his story is pretty well wrapped-up in 2077 and his actual mortal body has already been dead for decades by that game's start. Or so you might think. But that, and no other reason, is why you aren't Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith. In a recent stream (via GamesRadar ), Pondsmith sounded just as eager as Reeves to get the Hollywood star back into Silverhand's big boots. \"You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,\" said Pondsmith. \"I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.\" What ways? Well, canny old Pondsmith doesn't say. I don't think it's hard to figure out a few plausible theories, though.

I'm also not alone—if we go by Steam reviews, almost everyone who plays this thing agrees. It's got a sterling 98% \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score for English reviews . Basically, if you like tactics games, you're probably gonna like this thing. My only complaint at the time was that its postgame felt a smidge undercooked. Tactical Breach Wizards' agents all have really interesting, and powerful, suites of abilities—and by the time you get to its final missions, you're cleanly sweeping through its challenges without much trouble.

Though saying that, we aren't given a particularly in-depth look at what exactly that means in terms of climbing. Given that the two Scouts in the trailer are seen amongst a cluster of redwood trees, we can only assume that this biome will involve a lot of swinging between vines to reach the safety of platforms and Shelf Shrooms tucked between branches. However, one element that the trailer does hint towards is the addition of spiders.

Street Racing Syndicate arrived on PC a year later, and while it was no Need For Speed Underground or Burnout 2: Point of Impact, it found fans among those who enjoyed customizing its roster of licensed cares, free-roaming its Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami maps, and outrunning the police. What players didn't like was a bug specific to the PC version that made the sun blindingly bright on daylight tracks. \"HOW TO REMOVE THE SUN? LOL\" asks one poster on the Steam forum, while another laments, \"I guess the developers never heard of windshield visors or sunglasses.\" Wait long enough, and eventually a hero will come along—in this case a modder by the name of Radzerg, who just released a patch with the simple declaration, \"I've fixed the sun\".

Yet, within days of release, 55% of its Steam reviews are negative . \"Input lag is unacceptably high in every game—even offline\" says one, with some players complaining it's even noticeable in the menus. Others are upset that \"the online's in a terrible state. Quick play matches with random people only. You can't queue for more than one game at a time, so the community's splintered between games.\" Another laments, \"The 360/PS3 MK Kollection that came out over 10+ years ago had better netcode than this\".

Players are having trouble finding matches and are getting stuck in queue times ranging from 5 to 10 minutes before they're let back in. The subreddit is filling up with posts from players encountering errors and I can see several Twitch streamers waiting to connect.

It's currently sitting at around 286,000 players an hour after the spike.

Knee-high bushes and other shrubbery can be toggled on or off through the foliage graphics setting, and you probably want it on \"low\".

With the \"epic\" setting, the bushes obscure some of the ground around the edges of the car, which could make it hard to see someone at a distance.

Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft , two of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, have always tackled their modding scene—or AddOns, as they're often called—very differently. World of Warcraft has historically embraced AddOn creators with open arms, giving a ton of the game's information to them in-client through its API. Crack open the shell of any WoW raider's client and you'll find a homebrew moonshine concoction of custom raid frames, sound effects, and WeakAuras telling them what buttons to push and when.

    "body": "Cosplay is still a bit of an unknown world to me, but it's one I'd love to be more involved with. I've only ever cosplayed once, really—aside from the odd Halloween costume which I know doesn't really count—but that doesn't mean I don't try to stay as in the loop as possible. I've always been more of a lurker, spending hours scrolling through social media admiring everyone's commitment to their favourite characters, and I am constantly impressed by the creativity the cosplay community showcases. Character Select Welcome to Character Select, a weekly column where PC Gamer takes a look at the art and cosplay created by you. Each week, I'll highlight a few of my favourite pieces, spotlight and interview creators and artists, or generally just chew your ear off about the talents of the gaming community. It's been a big weekend for all sorts of cosplayers with MCM ComicCon and EGX in London, and the turnout of people rocking up dressed in their nerdiest best has not disappointed. So, instead of saving all of my favourites to a folder I'll inevitably visit once in a blue moon, trying to convince myself I'll sink more time into cosplay one of these days, I thought I'd share them with you…",
