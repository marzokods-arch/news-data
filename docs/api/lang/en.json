RingConn also promises longer battery life with the new smart ring. It’s more inclusive and stylish, expanding to 10 sizes for a better fit and offering five jewelry-like finishes. Smart rings have stayed pretty much the same for a while, so if yours still works, there hasn’t been a big reason to upgrade. That’s starting to change. At CES 2026 , RingConn is launching the Gen 3, which promises more than just a small update over Gen 2 . The RingConn Gen 3 still uses titanium but now comes in five colors and three finishes: Brushed Silver, Brushed Rose Gold, Polished Future Silver, Royal Gold, and a new Matte Black. Unlike Gen 2’s limited options, Gen 3 looks more like jewelry you’d want to wear.",

    "body": "Credit: Android Headlines TL;DR Samsung may reportedly raise the prices of the Galaxy S26 series in its home market, South Korea. This hike comes as a result of the increasing prices of internal components, especially DRAM and NAND modules. The hike, however, may be limited to buyers in South Korea, while prices in the US remain unchanged. The Galaxy S26 has been Samsung’s most confusing flagship lineup in recent years. Samsung was initially expected to overhaul the offerings, limiting them to just three models rather than four. The expectations fell flat when Samsung reportedly returned to its typical lineup, which is now expected to prevail, with the Galaxy S26 offering carrying over much of what the S25 offered. Now, we’re fast approaching the launch of the Galaxy S26 series, which means Samsung is in the final stages of readying the phones. Leaks in the recent past have already lent to credible information about the specifications of the three phones (alongside a fourth one later) launching in the Galaxy S26 series. So the next obvious step is to speculate on prices, but confusion prevails on that front as well.",

I had to learn to live life on life’s terms.” Jackson also addressed the mental health challenges she has faced during her sobriety, naming several conditions in her post. “Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder is a b&#8211;ch, so is PTSD and OCD,” she wrote. “If you’ve got this s&#8211;t or anything of the sort, you’re not alone.

At CES 2026 , LG Electronics officially reintroduced its Wallpaper TV concept, now calling it the world’s thinnest true wireless OLED TV. The LG W7 Wallpaper TV from 2017 was one of the most futuristic gadgets of the last decade. Its screen was so thin it looked like a poster held up by magnets. But it had one big flaw: a thick, unattractive ribbon cable that connected it to a required, bulky Dolby Atmos soundbar.

The Clicks Communicator is a full-fledged Android smartphone, featuring an integrated physical keypad and a nearly square 4.03-inch OLED screen (1,080 x 1,200 pixels). Clicks explains that the phone can be used as a standalone device, but added that it was also designed for people who use two phones. In fact, the company says it envisions the Communicator as a communication-focused device (surprise) while your other phone is focused on entertainment and content capture.",

The models I’ve been testing deliver a genuinely enjoyable viewing experience even in lighting conditions that used to send me scrambling for blackout curtains. Built-in Google TV also strengthens the projector push. It helps turn what used to be an obnoxious setup process into something refreshingly TV-like, especially since features like autofocus and auto keystone correction handle fine-tuning.",

Samsung has been developing a new feature for the Galaxy S26 Ultra called Privacy Display. This feature is designed to dim or hide the display when viewing the screen at an angle, preventing strangers from taking unwanted peeks. Back in September 2025, we spotted code within an alleged build of One UI 8.5 that provided some details about the feature. The following month, more information was revealed when the potential UI for Privacy Display leaked . Another leak has now dropped, and it shows us how this function will work.

Pre-orders begin today for $199, with shipping starting in May. 2025 was a surprisingly big year for Pebble fans. Last March, former Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky unexpectedly launched two new Pebble smartwatches : the Pebble 2 Duo and the Pebble Time 2. Now, on just the second day of 2026, Migicovsky has announced a third Pebble smartwatch — the Pebble Round 2. For all intents and purposes, the Pebble Round 2 is a spiritual successor to the Pebble Time Round, Pebble’s excellent circular smartwatch that was released in 2015. At first glance, the new watch looks indistinguishable from its older sibling. However, there are a couple of key upgrades that fix the original Pebble Time Round’s biggest flaws.",

All without completely abandoning modern apps and services. The MC03 builds on the idea behind the earlier MC02 , but Punkt says this new model is more clearly split into two areas. There’s Vault, a locked-down environment designed for trusted, privacy-vetted apps, and Wild Web, a more open space where you can install practically anything, but with visible controls to limit permissions, background activity, and data flows.

We also saw a few great lightweight mobile games released in 2025, although again, they were mostly ports. The Steam Frame hasn’t even been released yet, and we’re already seeing a blurring of the lines between Android games and PC games, and that trend is set to continue in the new year.",

After pushing back its deadline for installing the Bluetooth firmware twice, today is looking like the last official day you’ll be able to use Google’s flashing tool. Even after Google takes its tool offline, third-party efforts have preserved the Bluetooth firmware and allow you to host the flashing tool yourself. Cloud-based gaming is bigger than ever right now, whether you’re using services like Xbox Game Pass or just streaming games on your Switch . But despite this clearly being a viable business model, Google just couldn’t figure out how to make it work, and now we’re quickly coming up on the three-year anniversary of the company shutting down Stadia . While that was a very public failure for Google, the company still tried to make the best of the situation by giving Stadia hardware a new lease on life — and if you haven’t taken advantage of that yet, there’s an important deadline we’re running up against.

Even if you have the means to pick one up on a whim, just being a very fast car doesn’t necessarily make it the ideal vehicle for every occasion — god forbid you need to store anything in the trunk. That same situation applies to smartphones and the chips powering them. Every year, we see companies like Qualcomm introduce their latest silicon, trying to wow us with performance metrics that make the previous generation’s chips look positively glacial in comparison. That’s an important part of progress, absolutely, but just because there’s a new super-high-end option out there doesn’t mean it’s the best chip for the phone you need.",

    "body": "TL;DR The Samsung Galaxy A17 5G and Galaxy Tab A11+ both arrive in early January. The previous Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone of Q3 2025. The A17 5G costs $199.99; the Tab A11+ costs $249.99. Both will be available at major carriers and retailers. We pay a lot of attention to high-end devices, but many more people use Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones and tablets than the company’s more premium S and Z lines: the $200 Galaxy A16 5G was the best-selling Android phone last quarter . Today, Samsung announced the successor to that phone in the Galaxy A17 5G, along with a new budget-friendly tablet. Both will be available in January. The new Galaxy A17 5G looks like a minor refresh of the previous-gen A16 5G, carrying over several key specs: both phones come with Samsung’s Exynos 1330 (in the US); a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W wired charging support; and a 6.7-inch 90Hz display. The newer model is a fraction of a millimeter thinner, though, and benefits from new optical image stabilization in its 50-megapixel primary camera. It’ll go for the same $199.99 MSRP as the A16 5G.",

Astronomers discovered this galaxy cluster Dec. 31, 2020.

The new composite image shows that the Champagne Cluster is actually two galaxy clusters in the process of merging to form an even larger cluster. Multimillion-degree gas in galaxy clusters usually takes on an approximately circular or moderately oval shape in images, but in the Champagne Cluster it is more widely spread from top to bottom, revealing the presence of the two colliding clusters.
