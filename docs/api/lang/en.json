Before you get your hopes up for the kind of co-op you get in Skyrim Together , I should warn you that Witcher Online doesn't sync enemies between players, meaning that you won't be able to team up with some friends to take down a boss.

Sure, we don't really know who performs best in the endgame yet, and won't until after launch, but similar to Zenless Zone Zero, the usefulness of characters is primarily dependent on which type of team they perform best in. A character can be good because they're versatile and free-to-play friendly, or because they're currently the meta DPS or support for a specific art. Since Arknights: Endfield features elemental arts and combo skills which activate upon fulfilling specific conditions, such as reactions, team comp is the be-all and end-all. Currently, the top-tier teams are cryo and heat (though the latter has far fewer characters), though neither is free-to-play friendly, since they require six-star characters to shine. On the other hand, electric and cryo/physical hybrid teams are very free-to-play friendly, since most of the characters you need are four or five-stars. I'll rate each character below based on how valuable they are in their best team comp, or based on the fact that they're very strong and versatile, slotting into most teams, such as Gilberta, Ardelia, and Akekuri.

While I was laboriously putting that quiz together I noticed something interesting: a lot of games use a very stylized letter A in their logo. There are several logos where the A has someone standing inside it, a few with eyes or a face, and some shaped like an element from the game itself. I guess it's just a just a pleasantly flexible letter that designers can have a little fun with. So, I put together another letter quiz, and this time it's all about the letter A. I'll show you an A from a game logo, you type in what you think the game's name is. Don't worry, there aren't 26 of them this time. Let me know how you did in the comments!",

The shift isn't a big departure from the original spring target and not entirely unexpected after last year's Wake of the Water delay. The announcement came as part of Enshrouded's anniversary update and new roadmap reveal, celebrating two years in early access with details on upcoming features and rather interesting player milestones. Players have somehow spent nearly 21,000 years collectively exploring Embervale, and Steam says I've contributed 300 hours towards that myself, so I'm not wagging my finger at anybody. And even though parts of it remain unfinished, Keen Games says a whopping 5 million players have started the journey through Embervale's massive map. The added animal husbandry features seem pretty popular too, though I'm interested to know what kinds of critters make up the \"6 million pets tamed\" stat. I pick up every goat I see, so I reckon the goats I keep stuffing in chests account for about half that figure. Anyway, today's celebratory player stats are cool and all, but I'm more interested in what Enshrouded's reworked p…",

X user Jaykihn, who has a strong record for accurate Intel leaks, posted, simply, \" B70 Pro soon. \" In the discussion that followed, Jaykihn confirmed with a clear \"yes\" when queried respectively whether the B70 Pro would be G31-based and have 32 GB of VRAM. So, there we have it. Intel's G31 Big Battlemage is coming soon and as a 32 GB Pro graphics card and not as the Intel Arc B770 gaming card we're all dying to see.

Those changes included an overhaul to the armor transmog system, which is generating a lot of angst from players who are finding themselves forced to pay thousands of gold for the privilege of wearing outfits they'd already paid for. While we were skeptical about the proposed transmog updates back in November, the new system does have some appeal: Previously, transmogrification applied item appearances of your choice to equipment directly. You could save and apply entire ensembles at once, but whenever you replaced one of your equipment pieces—or if you just wanted to change outfits—you'd need to reapply your desired transmog and pay the associated fee for each piece of gear. (Image credit: Blizzard) The new transmog system is meant to replace those frequent transmog costs. Rather than paying to apply appearances to your gear itself, you instead purchase outfit slots that you can save ensembles to. Saving a transmog setup to an outfit slot costs a fee, yo…",

Verbinski, who directed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the American remake of The Ring, and animated Western comedy Rango, was pretty blunt in pinning the blame on Epic's Unreal Engine , which has been used more and more for visual effects in film and television in the past several years, including the Fallout TV series . \"I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said in an interview with pop culture site But Why Tho? . \"I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.\" Epic Games has now responded to Verbinski's statement. In an email sent to PC Gamer, Patrick Tubach, VFX supervisor at Epic Games, said: \"It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI.

Developer Pearl Abyss has promised a growing collection of mechanics and playstyles so bafflingly dense that it's still hard to picture how exactly it's all meant to fit together. Thanks to a freshly announced release date, however, we now at least know when we'll see the full picture—and launch day is just two months away. In a Steam news post , Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert has gone gold: The game's primary development is, for all intents and purposes, complete and distribution-ready—aside from whatever tweaks might arrive in a day one patch. The announcement also brought us a release date: Crimson Desert will launch on March 19. That means we've got just over eight weeks before we get our full and proper introductions to protagonist Kliff and the fantasy world of Pavel, and see just how well Pearl Abyss has managed to cram so many kinds of gameplay into one Kliff-shaped package. Kliff can seemingly do so many things that our Harvey Randall wrote last April after a hands-on preview that Crimson Desert is a kind of \"action RPG tesseract\" that's barely conta…",

As the curtain fell, a small group of diehards expressed hope that it might somehow be brought back without a reliance on EA's servers—hope that was given, well, hope when former executive producer Mark Darrah said Anthem did actually have local server code \"right up until a few months before launch,\" and more importantly, \" the code is there to be salvaged and recovered .\" That's a far cry from actually making it happen, but some people do seem to at least be making progress in that direction. Youtuber And799 (via Kotaku ) has posted a video showing Anthem alive and kicking, and—big points here—with two players (actually two accounts) logged in simultaneously.

Fast-forward to my young adulthood and suddenly the Sega of old was no more, and watching games like Shenmue 2 release on Xbox felt oddly like betrayal. But that was nothing next to seeing Sonic appear on the Nintendo GameCube. What madness was this? Luckily I'd already swapped one console war for another, having been an early adopter of Xbox. I fell in love with Halo and would go head-over-heels for Halo 2, and lived for years with a magazine poster for Halo 3 behind my television with that magical promise: \"Finish the fight.\" I did do other things, I promise, but I spent an awful lot of time with the Master Chief, and Xbox and Halo became synonymous in my mind with peak console gaming.

They can also be configured using a web-based app for Windows, iOS, and even Linux (via Chromium-based browsers) without the need for any software. This is a neat touch.

    "body": "Thunderbolt 5 is a powerful interface. It's also an expensive one. Available only on the latest devices, and with limited availability today, it took me a while for one to land on my lap. When one did, with the Alienware 15 Area-51 , I began my search for a hub that might let me take advantage of its high-speed capabilities. As I discovered, a Thunderbolt 5 hub runs anywhere from expensive to 'good lord, they can't be serious, can they?' The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma I'm looking at today is more the latter at $400 / £400 . But do cheaper Thunderbolt 5 hubs come with RGB lighting? They do not—at least most I've seen. The Thunderbolt 5 Dock offers a range of ports to those willing to drop that sort of moolah on the thing: 3x Thunderbolt 5 (downstream), 1x Thunderbolt 5 (upstream; for the connection to your PC, with 140 W power delivery), 1 Gb ethernet, 2x USB Type-A 3.2 Gen2, 1x USB Type-C 3.2 Gen2, an SD card slot, and a microphone/headphone combo port. Thunderbolt 5 supports PCIe 4.0, DisplayPort 2.1 and USB4 standards for a properly universal dock over a few of those connections. It's also a pretty slim device for all its features; at 207 x 85 x 31 mm. The 250 W power brick…",

But instead of Google appealing the US Department of Justice's antitrust ruling against it, this time the Federal Trade Commission is appealing a November 2025 ruling concerning Meta. The FTC originally filed its lawsuit against the company, then called Facebook, all the way back in 2020 . The original suit alleged the company had \"engaged in a systematic strategy\" of buying up competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, in order to maintain its social media monopoly. The case was brought before a US district judge in Washington, who ultimately ruled last year that Meta had not violated antitrust laws with these acquisitions. In his decision, Judge James Boasberg even noted that the FTC itself had reviewed and approved both Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, as well as the company's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp. Undeterred, the FTC is appealing that decision, and still highlights those same acquisitions as the motivation behind its most recent appeal .

It's also claimed that OpenAI will continue to make huge losses totalling $44 billion until 2029, when it won't just turn a profit, but will by then be generating Nvidia-style revenues. A new report from The Information claims to have seen internal OpenAI documents setting out various financial performance projections. That $14 billion loss for 2026 is said to be roughly three times worse than early estimates for 2025. Over the 2023 through end of 2028 period, the report claims OpenAI expects to lose $44 billion, before turning a profit of $14 billion in 2029. Somewhat incongruously, The Information also says that OpenAI's cash burn is not as bad as previously thought, with the company tearing through a mere $340 million in the first half of the most recent financial year. How that squares with overall losses counted in multiple billions isn't explained. The report further claims that OpenAI plans to spend an astonishing $200 billion through the end of the decade, 60% to 80% of which will be spent on training and running AI models.

According to Kurt Kuhlmann, Bethesda's former Elder Scrolls loremaster and the co-lead designer on Skyrim, \"the main problem with Starfield is it didn't fully cohere as a game\". Kuhlmann left Bethesda in 2023, around the time of Starfield's launch, so he was there throughout development and thus was present for a lot of changes in regards to how Bethesda worked and how staff communicated. When he was working on Skyrim, itself a massive endeavour, things were simpler. \"I was working directly on the game, and I was a lead,\" he says. \"That was how all the leads worked then, and so I was directly working with all the people, all the quest designers, myself.\" But from Skyrim on, that started to change, and it was \"one of the main things\" that Kuhlmann \"didn't like\".

    "body": "For anyone hoping against hope that the memory supply crisis just might start to stabilise in 2026, I've got bad news: An executive at Kioxia, a memory manufacturer based in Japan, recently admitted that the company's production volume for the year is already sold out. The managing director of Kioxia's memory business unit, Shunsuke Nakato, made the admission during an interview with Korean news outlet Digital Daily , elaborating that the ever-hungry AI industry's demand for memory has led to a challenging supply and demand situation. Nakato went on to say that, as many companies are continuing to invest in AI out of a fear of being left behind, the situation is likely to continue into 2027 at least. Though memory supplies are limited, Kioxia is apparently deploying something of a 'gentleman's agreement' with its clients, remaining committed to existing contracts rather than adopting a 'first-come, first-served' or 'everything to the highest bidder' approach. However, Nakato also admits that even long-term Kioxia customers are having to contend with as much as a 30% year-on-year price increase. Also interesting to note from this interview is Nakato's scepticism about QLC tech. For…",

I'd forgive you for believing that your end goal right now is finding mithril ore, but that's not the case. Mithril's not actually available yet, despite it being required for several recipes listed in-game. The good news is that, when it's eventually added, it won't just be another block to break—presumably in the unreleased fifth zone. Hypixel's founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme, says , \"We got some fun ideas about Mithril… let’s say it won't be as simple to mine as the others\". As for what these ideas are, exactly, that of course remains to be seen, and it's added to an already long list of to-dos the team already has to tackle— Collins-Laflamme only bought back the project two months ago and whipped up the early access build in record time, after all. Nevertheless, changes and new features are coming out at a breakneck pace right now, such as adding the ability to hide armour …",

It's not the biggest addition in PowerToys 0.97 , but Cursor Wrap might just be mana from heaven for some PC enthusiasts. As the name suggests, activating this tool essentially links the edges of multiple displays together, so as you pop off the edge of one monitor, the mouse cursor should seamlessly appear on the opposing edge of the next display. I know Windows already does this when you have, say, two monitors, but when you have something like two rows of three displays, stacked on top of each other, it actually does a poor job of moving the cursor around. This is especially true if you have the desktop expanded across the whole caboodle. With Cursor Wrap, that's no longer an issue, and you'll find that your mouse can now zip vertically through displays with ease. It does the same thing even if you only have one screen, linking the opposing edges into a uni…",

According to Digitimes (via Tomshardware ), \"Windows on Arm (WoA) platform notebooks using the N1X will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\" The report claims that after the launch of an initial variant of N1X in Q1 2026, three more versions of the chip will be released in Q2. What's more, Digitimes further says that Nvidia has a follow up, codenamed N2, lined up for release in the third quarter. If all this is true it's both exciting and somewhat peculiar. After all, we've just had the CES 2026 show , which surely would have been the perfect opportunity to get the maximum number of eyeballs on what Nvidia presumably plans to be a game changing chip for the PC industry.

So, why is this worth getting excited about? For a start, we've not really heard a peep about the tech in a long old time, and this high-profile deal pushes it back into the spotlight. For another, ReRAM will apparently give traditional flash memory a run for its money as Weebit describes it as a \"low-power, cost-effective NVM that has proven excellent retention at high temperatures.\" To elaborate, ReRAM is non-volatile, so it's more like NAND in that it can retain data aft…",

This is a Remedy game, after all. I don't remember a huge amount about its combat except that there's a lot of dashing, a lot of offensive levitating, and somehow office furniture is always involved. What I do remember well is the setting: Control is an action game, but it's also a very arch horror game set in the austere pebblecrete hallways of a brutalist tower called The Oldest House. Control's story and setting is often compared to the fictional SCP Foundation, which is basically hyper-conspiratorial crowdsourced weird fiction that has also inspired stuff like Lethal Company . I don't know how much more I can say to sell Control to you, and it's probably a waste of time anyway because money talks: Control is $4 on Steam at the moment.

But after that, he says it's on employers and job seekers to, more or less, just start using AI. \"The demand side of this is a little bit like, every firm has to start by using it,\" said Nadella, throwing in some industry-standard hyperbole by calling AI a \"cognitive amplifier\" that gives you \"access to infinite minds.\" The…",

The scene would be unrecognizable without all the indie hits that first found a home on Steam, and early attempts to mimic that plumber in the red hat led to the tech that gave us Doom. So dust off that gamepad and embrace the inherent fun of jumping over stuff with me. It's a genre largely unbeleaguered by big-budget bloat, intent on retaining the purity of old-school action at its best. Platformers remain fascinated with the ability of the videogame to sate a primordial human urge: to run, be free, and soar weightlessly over certain doom. From cerebral puzzle platformers, to parkour simulations, to cotton candy collectathons, the genre is as diverse and worth celebrating as it’s ever been.

Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.

It was a sticky situation for a while: Riot's decision to cancel Hytale and close Hypixel Studios after seven years of work (and for reasons that will probably never be entirely clear) seemed a definitive end to the story, but a seemingly faint hope that someone would step in to save the day became reality when Collins-Laflamme struck a deal to reacquire the whole thing in November 2025.
