After exploring Arcadia's many moons and space stations, visiting its various merchants and completing quests, I've found some weird ass weapons and armor, including, but not limited to: A gun that fires corrosive tumors you can then eat for health . A hammer with a slot machine built into it that randomly rewards you jackpots. A cowboy hat that boosts damage by 99% if you wait six seconds without shooting anyone in combat. It's a great thing, quite frankly, that The Outer Worlds 2 is leaning so heavily into the absurdity of its setting, trying to provide the kind of weird and wacky build options you'd see in Borderlands 4. Still, the strangest helmet I've come across in my travels through outer space is by far A New Point of View Mk 2. This fancy dome-protector is relatively tough to acquire and you'll miss it entirely (along with a bunch of other strange gear) if you don't complete a specific collectible quest. It's well worth it, though, for its defining feature: it changes the visual style of the game entirely. At first, I thought it was just a helmet, but when I whacked it on I realised the game now had arcade-st…",

On top of taking a hatchet to Halo's perennial Xbox and PC exclusivity, it's got all sorts of ground-up changes: new weapons, 4-player co-op, sprinting, and uh, \"enhanced level design.\" That last point fielded some criticism from Jaime Griesemer, game designer on the original CE and design lead on Halo 2 and 3. In a post on X , Griesemer reposted gameplay footage saying, \"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot.\" Tagging Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto, he added, \"What have they done to beloved B30?!\" You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters.But the worst part?

It's much more of an interactive TV show than I'm used to, pushing you from one scene to the next without letting you wander around and explore. But that gives it an appropriately brisk pace and kinetic energy that I'm finding pretty damn refreshing. (Image credit: AdHoc Studio) But when I realised it was going to be an episodic deal, I scoffed. An episodic game? In the year of our lord 2025? In the 2010s, when Telltale started releasing all of its games episodically, it was novel. It was also before streamers took over TV and dumped entire seasons on us instantly. Now the streamers have started to go back to traditional release schedules, but it still seemed wrong to have to wait to enjoy more of a game. It's finished. It's ready. Why can't I devour the whole thing? My lack of chill was even more overt after finishing the first episode, Pivot, which is 100% setup and only briefly lets you experience its most notable novelty.

We've got loads more PC Gamer quizzes , on everything from healthbars to weird currencies to absurd patch notes. Crusader Kings arguably has the best subreddit of all time . Not because it's informative, or the community is a lovely bunch, though both of those things are true. It's the best because it has thread titles like \"My son became a German and now my empire is dying\", constant grousing about whatever the Pope's getting up to, and endless hand-rubbing about what to do (or what not to do) with wives, heirs, and all those vassals any self-respecting Crusader King collects. This week's quiz is a simple one. There are 15 thread titles here. To prove your worth, separate the real from the made up. One note: Kwizly has a hint system that doesn't work very well with yes/no quizzes like this. So don't use it, or we'll send the Pope round. 2025 games : This year's upcoming releases Best PC games : Our all-time favorites Free PC games : Freebie fest Best FPS games : Finest gunplay Best RPGs : Grand adventures Best co-op games : Better together",

Sometimes there's a bunch of different dirty surfaces close together, and then I get several dings in quick succession. It's riveting stuff. That was a thing in the first game, but PowerWash Simulator 2 adds a big, circular surface cleaner, the Swirlforce Surf Ace, for maximum good job dings on flat surfaces. It's all the satisfaction and thrill of getting a new kitchen appliance as an adult, but instead of shoving it into a cabinet and forgetting it, I'm driving all over town and looking for excuses to use it.

As PC Gamer's Rory Norris described it last week, \" Battlefield 6 can be blindingly white at times , especially when looking/moving in or out of buildings. It's like my soldier's eyes are adjusting to the light in real time, but it instead causes my own retina to burn when viewing bright areas, or trick me into thinking I've gone blind when transitioning to dark areas.\" That's not great when everyone in your vicinity is doing their damnedest to shoot you.

More generally (and thoughtfully), though, there's just a broad sense of dissatisfaction with the remaster's attention to detail. The reaction reflects the risk of remastering a much-loved game like Plants vs. Zombies—and, for those who weren't hip to the scene 16 years ago, PvZ is much loved.

It's, I don't know, Vampire: The Masquerade – Sleepless in Seattle or something. All I know is that it's definitely not Bloodlines, and slapping that name on The Chinese Room's game was a mistake. (Image credit: The Chinese Room) More than a mistake, it was a disservice to the game itself. Here's the thing: I very much enjoyed Bloodlines 2. It's a great Vampire: The Masquerade game, dripping with atmosphere, vibrating with conspiracies, and hell, the combat can even be pretty fun when you're absolutely clowning on a gaggle of ghouls with your elder vampire abilities. But I say 'it's a great V:TM game' deliberately. It's a great Vampire game, but not a great Bloodlines game, and that latter name only ever detracts from the game we ended up getting 21 years after an RPG that people are still replaying today.

The Retro mechanical keyboard doesn't have rapid trigger, but it does have a few programmable keys and a solid feel. The 8BitDo Pro 3 carries on this tradition, but makes a few more compromises than its desk buddies. The controller I've been testing comes in a purple variant, with red and green face buttons, and is very clearly inspired by the Nintendo GameCube. Looking like tech from a few decades ago is sort of 8BitDo's shtick, and 8BitDo does it better than pretty much anyone else. The Pro 3 looks delightful, both on and off its charging stand, and that charging stand adds more than just an ornament to a room.

With a depth of connectivity options and that look, it already stood out, but $200 is a decent chunk of cash to spend, and we buy tech for more than just the look. And the answer to 'does it sound good?' ends up far more nuanced than I thought it would after my testing. The G2000 Pro's pretty iconic look is both a big positive and a negative. It's true that among your audiophile friends (assuming you have some), this will be one of the most 'out there' set of speakers. They have a radical angular design, plus a ring in the centre of the see-through plastic that is covered in RGB-lit lines. Powering the G2000 Pro on feels like an event in itself, bathing bright colourful lights into the room. It is truly striking.

According to Schafer, whose acclaimed adventure game studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2019, Spencer and the software giant have been true to their word, at least in his experience. \"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'\" Schafer said. \"And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.' And that's been true all these years … You know, creatively, we can be like, 'Hey, we want to make this game about a walking lighthouse,' and they're like, 'Cool.

With four seats, one turret gunner, and absolutely zero protection from bullets or mines, taking a ride in Battlefield 6's sole transport car is like announcing to the entire server that five free kills are vroomin' their way soon. In well over 60 hours of Battlefield 6, I've had just a handful of excursions in the The Light Ground Transport (or LGT) that didn't leave me riddled with bullets or suddenly exploded. It is so bad at its one job—safely transporting—that it's not unusual to watch your team ignore a fleet of free jeeps and choose to hoof it across the map instead. The LGT is a failure. The Traverser Mark 2 , a new armored transport truck arriving in Battlefield 6 Season 1 , is its redemption. I took the Traverser for a handful of test drives during a preview session on the upcoming maps Eastwood and Blackwell Fields , and much like the maps themselves, I came away unable to imagine Battlefield 6 without it. The Traverser is the LGT's bigger, stronger, and meaner sibling. It seats just four total, so one less than the LGT, but it's also packing three times the fire…",

CS2's wacky economy has certain constants, and one of those is that the super-rare and most valuable items are knives and to a lesser extent gloves. The price for a unique gun skin may well shoot into the stratosphere but, generally speaking, knives are the most sought-after commodity in the CS2 skin game.
