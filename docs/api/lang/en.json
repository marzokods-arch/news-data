Between the fantastic camera zoom, variety of video capture options, and premium extras, there was a lot to like. The X200 Pro wasn’t perfect, though. A weird glare issue on the primary camera, along with plenty of bloat, a dearth of AI features, and a ho-hum update pledge sullied the otherwise great package. Now, vivo has launched the X300 Pro, its next flagship phone for global markets. So does the new phone pick up the baton and run even faster, or does it stumble and fall in a heap? I took it for a spin for a few weeks to find out.",

    "body": "Credit: Nick Fernandez / Android Authority TL;DR Steam’s maker, Valve, has been playing a huge role in Windows emulation on Android. Valve has funded projects such as Pex emulator and Proton, which allow Windows games to run on Android more easily. Pex and Proton also form the basis for GameHub, a popular Windows emulator for Android. For nearly three decades, Valve Corp. has played an indispensable role in PC gaming, especially contributing to distribution and DRM rights for titles through Steam . But more recently, the company has been interested in making gaming more mobile, first with the launch of the Steam Deck and, more recently, with the Steam Machine , its PC-console hybrid for running Windows games, as well as the Steam Frame XR headset. However, in addition to contributing to PC gaming’s portability, Valve might solve another problem: the uninspiring state of title support on Arm chips for laptops, including Apple’s M series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X. And in doing so, the indirect benefactor will be the broader set of Arm devices, i.e., mobile phones and tablets.

Pixel Watch users have been asking for better gesture controls for years, and it looks like Google is finally answering their call. Ever since the Pixel Watch 4 introduced Raise to Talk for summoning Gemini , users, including yours truly, have hoped Google would expand its capabilities into more intuitive wrist and finger-based controls. After all, wrist gestures were a thing in the early Android Wear era before being quietly dropped them during the transition to Wear OS. Meanwhile, rivals like Samsung and Apple have offered gestures such as double-tap/double-pinch, fist tap, and more for years now. Well, it looks like the Pixel Watch will finally catch up to its competition real soon.",

Top US searches included Charlie Kirk, KPop Demon Hunters, and the iPhone 17, while specific categories covered games like Battlefield 6. Global trends were heavily influenced by cricket matches and Gemini, though the iPhone 17 also appeared on the worldwide list. December is the month of recaps. We’ve seen recaps from YouTube , Google Photos , and even Google TV so far, alongside those from other companies and services.

Some critical connectivity features like Wi-Fi support and notifications were paywalled behind Premium. Nuki has now decided to do away with Premium subscriptions, instead selling the Smart Lock for a slightly higher upfront cost. Installing a smart lock is one of those changes you don’t necessarily fully appreciate until you actually do it — being able to leave the house without carrying a set of keys is just so weirdly freeing. And if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s as good a time as any to do so. Products like Nuki’s Smart Lock make it quick and easy to add these smarts to an existing lock without needing to replace all your hardware. We’ve already been a fan of Nuki’s solutions for locks in Europe, and this past summer saw the company open its doors to US shoppers , as well — but with one key difference.

I’ve always been intrigued by extended- and mixed-reality headsets since I spend long hours working on computers and love watching immersive content. After an impressive in-store demo, I paid the price of a used car for my Vision Pro. The honeymoon phase wore off in the weeks and months that followed, and now, the recent Samsung Galaxy XR launch has me thinking I invested in the wrong XR platform. The dream of having a do-it-all device that can handle your productivity, entertainment, and gaming needs is still very much alive. I question whether the hardware is mature enough to deliver on that dream, but one thing’s for sure: Samsung’s Galaxy XR comes closer to realizing it than Vision Pro. I’ve lived with the mistakes Apple made in creating the Vision Pro as an early adopter, forcing me to take extreme measures like 3D-printing custom comfort accessories, buying extra straps, and paying for overpriced digital content.",

The other alternative is to call other users over Meet, but it requires their accounts to be added to the display as well. In 2018, Google added the option to call smart displays with Google Home over Duo . While it was considered a handy option by some, the feature truly did not take off as Google had expected. The lack of user interest could partly be blamed on Google’s limited love for smart displays (including abandoning the Nest Hub itself) and on the feature being limited to folks who use US English as their default device language. Now that Meet has replaced Duo, Google seems to be killing the option to call your home devices. As noted by Reddit user chelitazz , Google appears to have removed the “Call Home” button from the Google Home app on Android.

This is a paid application that also serves as a file manager. If you use a Wear OS smartwatch with your Android flagship, chances are that you’ve been tempted by the newer watch faces that Google has released for the Pixel Watch 4 . It’s possible to install these watch faces on other watches, but you need to know how to sideload using ADB on your smartwatch. While the process is straightforward if you can follow a guide , it’s admittedly still a bit too complicated for the average user.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told workers Monday that OpenAI has entered “code red” when it comes to improving the quality of ChatGPT, per an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and The Information . According to Altman, the company has more to do to improve the quality of its core product — specifically in personalization features, speed and reliability, and allowing ChatGPT to answer more questions. In order to focus on these goals, Altman reportedly says in the memo, OpenAI is delaying planned additional features like ads in ChatGPT, AI agents for shopping and other tasks, and a digital personal assistant called Pulse.",

It will offer maximum payments to $7,500 and a new claim deadline of December 18. Eligibility is based on the severity of leaked data, with payouts ranging from $100 to $7,500. Claims can be filed online with a Class Member ID or by mailing a printed form, and payments are expected in early to mid-2026. We first reported on a major AT&amp;T data breach settlement back in August , which at the time was set to pay up to $177 million in total, with impacted customers able to claim upwards of $5,000. While this was originally supposed to happen back in November, it seems the dates and planned payouts have shifted a bit. As first reported by IBT , the final breakdown will see some users paid as much as $7,500, and the new deadline to file is December 18. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ?",

This move contradicts Google’s previous rejection of a similar user request, where the company cited security risks and the sensitive nature of PII as reasons to keep the IMEI hidden on locked devices. While the feature could help law enforcement return lost or stolen devices without seizing or wiping data, it raises concerns that malicious actors could misuse the easily accessible identifier. Every single phone, Android or otherwise, has an IMEI number . The IMEI number is a unique identifier that identifies a device on a mobile network, much like a personal identification number. It’s generally a good idea not to reveal or broadcast your phone’s IMEI number, just to avoid sharing it with malicious actors. However, there are situations where easier access to a phone’s IMEI number might have been useful. The latest release of the Personal Safety app, v2025.11.13.831777920, includes code that suggests Google may soon allow access to your phone’s IMEI number f…",

As the name implies, it will have the same 4:3, 4.7-inch 120Hz IPS display as the RG Slide and RG 477M , which is one of the most impressive panels we’ve tested for retro games.

In fact, I originally switched to Android (Google Pixel 2 XL “panda edition,” which is still one of my favorite designs) specifically because I liked the images that Google’s camera app produced. Year over year, camera upgrades brought significant upgrades that — for me, at least — warranted buying a new phone each year. But in more recent years, the improvements have been less dramatic and, in many cases, not very noticeable to the average user. As someone who has continued to upgrade most years, this made me wonder how Google’s latest device stacks up against one of its predecessors , so I decided to compare the Pixel 8 Pro to my latest Pixel 10 Pro . Let’s dig into the pixels to see how a two-year-old device stacks up against Google’s latest efforts. Are you sure we’re using two different devices? Let’s start with the main camera . The lens itself is identical on both devices, so in theory, the images should be relatively similar.",
