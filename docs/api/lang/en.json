But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us.\" Of course, CDPR has taken The Witcher in new directions before with spinoffs like Gwent and Thronebreak…",

Plants vs. Zombies (Image credit: PopCap) Developer: Popcap Year: 2009 Plants vs. Zombies is a cute game unless you really take a close look at what's happening. My melon-pult flings a watermelon across the screen where it collides with a zombie, knocking its head off. That's the body of a dead person that's just been decapitated. And it happens every few seconds! My lawn would be covered in human heads if they didn't magically disappear. Grisly. Watching my plants get eaten by zombies is also disturbing. My poor, brave tall-nut, weeping yet still defiant as zombies rip fistfulls of nutmeat from its body and shove them into their rotting mouths. Even replacing my ragged t-nuts with new ones is a bit horrifying: I don't think I'm healing them, I think I'm euthanizing them in favor of new recruits. Monstrous. And what happens to single-use plants like squashes and ice-shrooms when they're activated? They sacrifice themselves? Dying for the cause? This game is non-stop carnage even when you win. So it was a true joy to progress far enough into PvZ to unlock the Zen Garden, a place where my…",

Right now is just a hard time to have a really good idea of what the price is gonna be.\" When asked if the Steam Machine would be subsidized like a console, which tend go for around $450-600 USD these days, Griffais said no. That isn't to say the device will necessarily be priced like a prebuilt PC, though.

Contra-style platforming is just one dimension on offer here. If you've ever played Wild Guns or even Duck Hunt, you'll be familiar with the gallery shooter: arcadey games where you shoot into the screen at enemies as they pop in and out of the background. Contra has had levels like this in the past, but in Neon Inferno, you're both run-and-gunning and gallery shooting simultaneously: hold down the right bumper, and you swap your aim between the background and foreground. You might think this would get chaotic, and it does. Very quickly in fact, even in the 10-minute demo on Steam. That said, Neon Inferno is more forgiving than you might expect from the genre.

Over on GTAForums , user JohnCGaming has written something that can only be described as a scholarly breakdown of co-protagonist Jason’s military background, and it’s quickly become required reading for anyone interested in Rockstar’s long-awaited crime sim. Titled Jason’s Military Service, Slightly Analyzed , the post runs thousands of words and reads more like a military history essay than a standard fan theory. Drawing on decades of US Army lore, historical citations, and deep Rockstar sleuthing, the author argues that Jason may have once served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, one of America’s most elite light-infantry units. The evidence? A blink-and-you-miss-it tattoo visible on Jason’s left arm—a skull beneath a parachute, framed by the word \"Marauders\". (Image credit: Rockstar) That single design, the post explains, appears to reference Merrill’s Marauders, a legendary World War 2 infiltration unit whose lineage now forms the backbone of the modern Ranger Regiment.

Sektori is a twin-stick developed by former Housemarque developer Kimmo Lahtinen, most easily described as a roguelike take on Geometry Wars. Yes, it's another game that borrows that three-card upgrade system from Vampire Survivors and slaps it into a familiar experience, but not only does this work extremely well, it's also only a fraction of what makes Sektori great. I wrote a little about Sektori a while back, but at that point I'd only played the demo. I took an early copy on holiday with me a couple of weeks back, planning to check it out among a bunch of other games. Instead, I just played Sektori. For 40 hours.

Yet Return to the Reik isn't a straight port of Vermintide's distinctive River Reik, as Fatshark hints in a Steam post that \"Things are not as before\". River Reik was introduced in Vermintide's \"Death on the Reik\" DLC released in 2017. The DLC only has a 'Mostly Positive' Steam rating, which would seem to contrast with Fatshark's claims about its popularity. As mentioned, however, Return to the Reik isn't a straight rerun of the map. Fatshark says the new version brings \"expanded, boat-focussed gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and centre\".

Its story ushered players through its slice of Sicilian countryside in a rather impatient manner, and while its Explore mode technically offered freedom to roam, roaming was all you could do. But with the release of the Free Ride update, that's all changed. Well, slightly changed. Free Ride replaces Explore mode completely, offering a similarly open-ended experience while fleshing it out with actual stuff to do. Whether or not this stuff is worth doing is another question, but at the very least it's an improvement over nothing. Primarily, Free Ride introduces two new activity types—the old videogame staples of racing and combat. Races come in both car and horse varieties, though vehicles get substantially more love than their equine counterparts. Petrolheads can participate in three lap-based circuit races, three linear road sprints, and six time trials. Horses just get three circuit races, though given how little I enjoyed wrangling gee-gees in The Old Count…",

At the same time TCGs are still competing for attention with the last decade's huge growth in the resurgent board game, miniatures wargame, and roleplaying game communities. They're also sharing space with digital card games, which give many people the strategic experience of playing a TCG without the social one. But Magic's still a juggernaut, with only two long-term competitors really sticking around: The Pokémon TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh, neither of which are actual threats to Magic's throne. In Pokémon's case simply because its audience is by necessity either younger or—in many cases—simply speculatively collecting rather than properly playing.

By the time of Injustice 2, Superman has been imprisoned for his crimes, Clock King's had his daft head blown up, Green Arrow's been killed and replaced by a version of himself from a dimension where his wife died instead, and Gorilla Grodd's taken over Gorilla City in a bloody coup. Take that,…",

Fresh off a rewatch of the first season I'm replaying New Vegas right now myself, and keeping an eye on new mods like the ones that add a unique upgradable outfit for the Courier and extend the companion wheel . The highlight so far is Lip Motion Fix , a mod that is available for both New Vegas and Fallout 3 since it deals with a consistent issue in both games. As modder Asterra highlights in a before-and-after video, lip sync is broken in both games in the exact same ways. The dialogue generation system gets a bunch of things wrong, defaulting to a closed mouth when a character should be pronouncing the \"ee\" sound at the end of \"modesty\" for instance, or treating \"town\" as if it's pronounced \"tone\". It also has trouble with elements of the script like dashes and voice actor guidance given in brackets, and plenty of other things besides. Which is why Lip Motion Fix has a lot of work to do, not only in fixing the multiple lip-sync problems across these two games, but being compatible with popular mods that tweak dialogue and replace actors like Brave New World does—as…",

In the past, you immediately got half the souls (split with nearby allies) when a trooper died and had to shoot the other half out of the air as it floated from the corpse. Now, the first half of the income also has to be manually secured—it will fall to the ground, and you'll have to walk within a short radius of the souls to claim them. Unlike the souls which have to be shot, these can't be denied by the enemy team and will appear translucent to them. Still, it will certainly lead to more fights breaking out in the laning phase; heroes that prefer to stay back and farm from afar will have to get closer to the action so they can snag those precious souls.

Grand Theft Auto 5, on the other hand, followed the same two-year console-to-desktop pilgrimage a full decade earlier. (Image credit: Rockstar) That first time switching between Michael or Franklin or Trevor was a wonderful feeling, as the camera moved skyward, birds-eye-view and in slow-motion, before darting in a different direction across the map and landing back at ground level; you now in control of someone else altogether. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a game that comes close to the same feeling and masterful execution of the mechanic besides Insomniac's Spidey sequel. Back in 2013, it was a watershed moment for the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole.

Valve's legendary narrative shooter was no exception, as former Valve developer Tom Forsyth shared in a thread on Mastodon . In the thread, Forsyth discusses a bug he encountered while working on a VR version of Half-Life 2, back in 2013 when Valve was considering where it wanted to go with the technology. HL2 was one of the easiest translations to VR in Valve's back catalog—it was a relatively recent release, and the \"tricks with perspective\" in Portal \"were of course a nauseating disaster.\" The problem was, this new VR build softlocked the player mere minutes into the game. In the opening scene , when a metro cop is meant to usher the player through a door, the door wouldn't open in the VR build for reasons that weren't clear, freezing the player in place to wait for a necessary story event that never comes. \"Oh dear,\" Tom Forsyth recalled in his thread. \"We can't ship this. I get some other folks, including some folks who worked on HL2 originally, and yep—it's broken. And it's broken when y…",

And despite not being in a fully-finished state yet, even after a decade? I can tell those 11 years of labour were done out of love. I hesitate to use the word \"cosy\" to describe a game, given how that only really describes a vague aesthetic, but I struggle to find another word that fits Tavern Keeper, here. It has a goofy, polygonal artstyle, its UI is overflowing with kitschy little details, and its story books—more on those in a moment—are narrated by Steven Pacey, a seasoned audiobook narrator with a library under his belt. Playing Tavern Keeper is like stepping into a warm bath or wrapping yourself up in a heated blanket. It is, perhaps fittingly, what I imagine a Hobbit feels like while tucked into their favourite hidey-hole with a good book. It is an unrelentingly lovely experience, despite the barely-contained managerial chaos you'll be trying to channel during your playthroughs. Despite its comf…",

How the hell do you reach the extraction on Stella Montis? I'm still figuring out that last part.

By default, your bike-loving citizens will cycle along the standard road network with cars and trucks. But you can create specific bicycle paths and bicycle road lanes to separate cars from cyclists—which is safer and healthier for everyone. Since cyclists also need a place to park their bikes when they reach their destination, the update also adds numerous types of bike parks. Just as adding more car parks encourages drivers not to park on the street, bike parks will encourage more citizens to cycle around the city rather than drive. But the bike patch adds considerably more, such as several new types of park. This includes a bike park that is also, wait for it, a bike park.

Better, if you're making a dedicated cooperative experience, to ensure voice chat is integrated into that. It took five months, but Firebreak has finally done this.

While update 2.3 is mainly Ripatorium focussed, it's worth briefly going over the adjustments it makes to the campaign and general play. Regarding the former, the update introduces another round of combat encounter tweaks, adding an enemy here, removing another there. On the latter front, it adds an option to adjust TDA's \"Brink of Death\" feature, which determines how likely you are to survive a near-death situation. Basically, you can now reduce the system's impact on combat, making you more likely to die at low-health. Onto the main event, update 2.3 introduces \"Ripatorium 2.0\", which chiefly converts The Dark Ages' arena mode from a purely wave-based affair to a more structured round-based format.

This drive for efficiency is felt across the whole of Black Ops 7, but nowhere more so than the campaign, a grinding slog through the forthcoming Warzone map update and the occasional multiplayer map retooled for wave defense against mindless AI hordes. The premise of the campaign itself is complete nonsense: after being dosed with the Cradle bio-weapon from Black Ops 6, Alex Mason's son has to retread the memories of his father (and, confusingly, his father's squadmates) through shared hallucinations.

If you've watched a single Twitch stream or Marvel movie in the past 15 years, you're probably all too familiar with the concept of a green screen, a bright, single-color surface that makes it easy to blank out a background and fill it in with something else. A Hawaiian beach, a bunch of CGI superheroes punching each other, etc. The more accurate color-agnostic term for the technique is chroma-keying, which is actually how Windows rendered all of its video back in the old days. \"The media player program didn't render the video pixels to the screen,\" longtime Microsoft developer Raymond Chen wrote recently in a blog post . Instead, Windows would render a green screen (or a different color, depending on the version), then \"render the video pixels to a graphics surface shared with the graphics card.\" The fina…",

The search has been going so poorly that I put rusted gears on the backburner while I focused on quests, convinced that pretending I don't care about rust nor gears would magically conjure them in the next dusty toolbox I opened. Then this morning, I saw an X post from Arc Raiders Hub with a ton of views telling of a place where the rusted loot flows like a rushing river: \"THIS PLACE GUARANTEES A RUST PART 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES YOU VISIT!\" the hot tip proclaimed. So I went topside to check it out myself. The spot in the video is the North Elevator of Dam Battlegrounds , a place that I've visited at least a hundred times before, but never picked apart for loot. Right next to the elevator are a handful of buses and cars. According to the tip, the breachable compartments on the back of these buses always contain rusted gears.

The interview starts off with a real bang: When asked what he thinks of \"the problem of predators on Roblox,\" Baszucki replies, \"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well. How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together?

Windows head Pavan Davuluri said earlier this month that Microsoft's OS is \"evolving into an agentic OS,\" and I can't say I'm excited about the prospect. Suleyman's inability to comprehend that lack of enthusiasm can easily be resolved with a classic technique from ancient philosophy, or maybe it was an ad for taco shells , in which one accepts two different things at the same time.

But the Battlefield-to-battlefield pipeline is alive and well, and a new initiative in the UK aims to go harder on it than ever.

Basically, in each run you are the custodian of a city on wheels, as it rolls along pursued by ever-escalating hordes of monsters. Your character has auto-firing weapons, like in Vampire Survivors, but so does the city. Instead of adding to your arsenal, level ups allow you to add more buildings, from towers to farmland to factories, all feeding into your defence. If your hero dies, you simply place a grave in your city and spawn a new one—but if your city takes too many hits, it crumbles, and the run is over. So guarding your home as it trundles along is vital… but you're also encouraged to risk breaking away to explore. Out at the edges of the 'road' can be found trees, rocks, and gold ore, all useful in your quest.

    "body": "The Witcher 4 is bound to, as most of CDPR's games end up doing (even if it takes them a while), shake the RPG firmament. Especially given this time, it's got a new lead: With Ciri taking over the role of the game's protagonist, donning Geralt's old boots for her own adventure. Not only that, but the new lead has a new voice actor , with Ciara Berkeley stepping into the role in place of Jo Wyatt. Geralt's long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle, has been enthusiastic about the choice to have Ciri take the lead —and withering towards people who need to \"read the damn books\" . And now, in a sweet display of voice actor camaraderie, he's stated that he thinks Berkeley will nail the new role, too. That's per an interview our friends over at GamesRadar+ did with The Witcher vet during the Golden Joystick Awards 2025. Cockle states that he hadn't met Berkeley in person until the awards themselves, but now that he has? He's sold. \"I only spoke with her briefly, just today. We exchanged some DMs a couple of weeks ago just to say hi,\" Cockle told the site. \"She's lovely, and I think she's going to do a great job. She's got a fantastic presence in person. I don't really have any advice. I've off…",

The benefit has been a more consistent release schedule. But there are downsides too. The first of these expansions, Secrets of the Obscure, felt like it was trying to pack too much into its limited development schedule—its ambition in terms of story far outstripping what ArenaNet had the time to make. Despite plenty of positives, it ultimately felt rushed and underdeveloped. Last year's Janthir Wilds was more assured, taking valuable lessons from SotO in terms of its scope. It launched with one of the best maps in recent memory (alongside a second that was simply OK), and brought a handful of features that made for a promising first impression. It put its best foot forward, but then ran out of steam. What followed in the subsequent updates was… fine, mostly, but paled in comparison to the expansion's opening salvo, and didn't make the most of the concepts the story was teasing.

As reported by Dexerto , the statement from the earnings call said Nvidia has \"evolved over the past twenty-five years from a gaming GPU company to now an AI data center infrastructure company.\" The Nvidia Newsroom X account shared a longer quote from CEO Jensen Huang, where he said \"We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI.

Fortnite is promising a full suite of back blings, pickaxes, emotes, and LEGO minifigure versions to go alongside them.
