    "body": "We’ve seen some unexpected battery behavior in the Pixel 10 series. Battery life is typically okay for us on Google’s latest, but depending on the workload, Pixel 10 phones sometimes offer shorter battery life than last year’s Pixel 9 series did. Stranger still, the Pixel 10 Pro XL in particular can be annoyingly inconsistent. Curious to know more, we started asking how you all feel about battery life in Pixel 10 phones beginning in October — and now, nearly two months on, we’ve got the results of that polling. According to our poll, most readers — about an even third — report that the Pixel 10 series’ battery life is “great,” with the phones lasting through an entire day, no sweat. That’s the type of behavior you’d expect out of a flagship phone that’s only a few months old, and it’s good to see that it’s the most common experience among our readers. Another 30 percent of respondents say battery experience has been “average.”",

    "body": "TL;DR Apple launched an Apple TV app on the Google Play Store in early 2025, but it was missing a core Android streaming feature. Now, an update to the Apple TV app for Android adds Google Cast support for casting to smart TVs and displays. The Apple TV app’s Google Cast implementation includes a miniplayer and full-screen UI while streaming. Apple TV is becoming a popular streaming service outside of the Apple ecosystem, with viral hits like Severance, Pluribus, and Ted Lasso. The streaming platform finally earned its own Android app in February, allowing Android users to subscribe to Apple TV or the MLS Season Pass on their smartphone via Google Play Billing. While the Android app supported many of the same features as its iOS counterpart, it was missing one thing: Google Cast support. Now, that’s changing, with version 2.2 of the Apple TV app for Android adding Google Cast support. It’s rolling out now on the Google Play Store , making it easy for users to cast Apple TV shows to their favorite smart TVs and displays. There’s a persistent Cast button beside the Apple TV account bubble on the app’s homepage. A quick tap reveals Google Cast displays nearby, including any Nest Hubs…",

This weekend, a Reddit user spotted a new Labs feature that purportedly lets you tweak the content on your Discover feed to your liking — using AI, of course. User Gaiden206 posted screenshots of the new experiment on the r/pixel_phones subreddit. Called “Tailor your feed,” the experiment lets you tell the Google app specifically the type of content you do or don’t want to see in Discover, with flexibility to add or remove topics, or narrow the focus of a type of content you’re already seeing. You can even use it to have Discover pick up or exclude content from specific sources.",

Mobile networks in general were usually faster than airport Wi-Fi, and twice as fast on average. Wi-Fi still prevailed at a few locations, but most airports haven’t yet adopted the more recent Wi-Fi standards. As airports brace for the holiday travel rush, a new report suggests that your mobile carrier may make a big difference when it comes to the last-minute downloads at the airport. According to new data, Verizon consistently delivers faster mobile download speeds at airports than its competitors, usually also far surpassing the speed of the airport Wi-Fi itself. The report from Ookla , which analyzed Speedtest data from the first half of 2025, found that Big Red delivered the fastest median download speeds at many major US airports. The report compared airport Wi-Fi performance with AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon across the 50 busiest airports in the country, looking specifically at median download speeds.",

Some researchers estimate that there are as many as two trillion galaxies in the observable universe. At first glance, these galaxies might appear to be randomly scattered across space, but they’re not. Careful mapping has shown that they are distributed across the surfaces of giant cosmic “bubbles” up to several hundred million light-years across. Inside these bubbles, few galaxies are found, so those regions are called cosmic voids. NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will allow us to measure these voids with new precision, which can tell us about the history of the universe’s expansion.

The workaround gained attention after employees and customers shared tips about paying cash to bypass T-Life. With cash now routed through the app, all standard in-store transactions appear to follow the same T-Life process. Like it or not, T-Mobile is determined to ensure the T-Life app is the hub for all customer activity . The latest move in this regard appears to be the company closing a loophole that allowed in-store customers to sidestep its app. Until recently, paying with cash meant transactions could still be handled through older in-store systems rather than the app, but that no longer seems to be the case. According to reporting from PhoneArena , T-Mobile has now added cash payments directly into T-Life, meaning those transactions are also routed through the app. The change was highlighted in a Reddit post and subsequently confirmed to the publication by a T-Mobile employee, suggesting the update is already live in stores.",

    "summary": "There aren't many Android gaming handhelds this big, and this one will surely undercut the competition.",
    "body": "TL;DR The budget-focused handheld maker MANGMI has revealed its next device, called the Pocket Max. It features a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel, plus full-size sticks and front-facing speakers. Benchmark leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 865, which would help keep costs lower than other large handhelds. Android gaming handhelds have had a huge year, with devices of all shapes and sizes more affordable than ever. One standout hit was the PSP-focused MANGMI AIR X , which blew us away for less than $100. The company has just teased its second handheld release, and so far, it’s looking like another winner. Called the MANGMI Pocket Max, it lives up to its name with a massive 7-inch 144Hz OLED panel. That alone puts it in rarified territory, since only a handful of Android gaming handhelds can match that size. The AYN Odin 2 Portal, AYANEO Pocket EVO, and Razer Edge are the only true OLED alternatives, but they’re all expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to $800 for the best experience.",

    "body": "One UI 8.5 (left) and iOS 26 Credit: Joe Maring / Android Authority Samsung’s One UI has always proudly sported its own personality. It’s obviously Android, but it has also long looked and felt distinctly “Samsung,” even as other Android skins borrowed ideas from all over the place. With the One UI 8.5 beta now in the wild, though, that identity is starting to feel like it’s up for debate. In a recent opinion piece , my colleague Joe Maring said One UI 8.5 might be the update where Samsung finally went a step too far. He highlighted changes like the new Quick Settings layout and refreshed Samsung apps, which can be tweaked to look a lot like iOS 26’s Control Center and navigation bars. The update adds useful customization and isn’t short on polish, but Joe’s bigger point was questioning the point at which refinement starts to feel more like imitation. That question is what led us to ask our readers how they feel about One UI 8.5’s iOS-like changes.",

    "body": "Credit: Jonathan Feist / Android Authority TL;DR Popular robot vacuum Roomba’s maker, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy. iRobot’s business will transition to a new owner, which is also its primary manufacturer. The company has shown signs of distress since its acquisition by Amazon failed to secure the EU’s approval in early 2024. Roomba has, over the past decades, become the colloquial term for household robot vacuums. Despite its success, the company behind the product lineup is facing an economic downturn. Roomba’s seller, iRobot, recently announced (via The Verge ) that it has filed for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware. However, iRobot is using Chapter 11 terms, which means that the business is likely to continue to exist rather than being liquidated to pay back its debtors. Instead, iRobot will transfer 100% of the business ownership to its primary manufacturers, Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co. Ltd. and Santrum Hong Kong Co. Ltd., who will hold the rights collectively under the name Picea.",

Then, the Galaxy S26 Pro was unceremoniously killed before it was even launched ( not that it seemed that exciting to begin with ), and the rumors converged back to the same ol’ brand new Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. This internal confusion and identity crisis at Samsung has left the company scrambling for last-minute plans, and it shows. Every leak we’ve heard so far points to the Galaxy S26 Ultra being a semi-decent upgrade to the S25 Ultra, since it was always part of the company’s plans, but the S26 and S26 Plus are practically repackaged and unchanged from their S25 counterparts. This is why I don’t need to wait for 2026 to be over before claiming what I already know: The Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will be the worst phones of 2026.",

Currently, the feature automatically turns off after a period of inactivity, forcing users to constantly manually re-enable it. The new behavior is live in the latest Android Canary builds, though a stable release might not happen until Android 16 QPR3 or Android 17. One of the most powerful tools at an Android developer’s disposal is the Android Debug Bridge ( ADB ). This command-line tool lets you control your Android device from a PC, allowing you to quickly push new apps, view system logs, and much more. It’s also essential for tinkerers and enthusiasts looking to remove bloatware or access hidden features, explaining why so many non-developers also install it. While developers and enthusiasts may use ADB for different reasons, they agree on one thing: using it wirelessly sucks. Fortunately, Google is rolling out a small update to wireless ADB that should make it much less annoying.

Here, we can see the star going through a rapid transformation from a red giant to a planetary nebula, during which it blows its outer layers of gas and dust out into the surrounding space. The recently ejected material is spat out in opposite directions with immense speed — the gas shown in yellow is moving close to a million kilometers an hour. Astronomers rarely capture a star in this phase of its evolution because it occurs within the blink of an eye – in astronomical terms. Over the next thousand years the nebula is expected to evolve into a fully-fledged planetary nebula.",

It is currently priced at CNY 3,749 (~USD $530) and is limited to China. JMGO has expanded its projector lineup once again, this time with the JMGO O3, a compact ultra-short-throw (UST) laser model designed to deliver big-screen entertainment in smaller spaces. The projector quietly launched in China earlier this month and is already drawing attention, and not only thanks to its unusually low price for a laser-based UST. What really sets the projector apart is just how compact it is. At only 250 × 219 × 107mm and about 2.4kg, it’s dramatically smaller than JMGO’s own O2S Ultra, which nearly doubles it in both footprint and weight. That tiny profile makes its performance even more impressive: the JMGO O3 can throw a 100-inch image from just 22cm off the wall thanks to a 0.18:1 throw ratio. In practice, you get a cinema-sized picture in spaces where bulkier UST units might not fit, making it suitable for tight apartments, bedrooms, dorm rooms, or secondary media setups.",

It turns out that Google added a flag in October that allows it to adjust the emoji column counts in Gboard, and it’s now set to eight. If your Gboard emojis have felt oddly large lately, you’re not alone. There’s a good reason why those emojis are suddenly looking bigger.",

The ultimate objective Google foresees for Gemini is to help you with basic and mundane tasks on your phone. One of them is helping you navigate menu items better through a conversational interface. Google Home recently added a feature that lets you “Ask Home” about things such as objects or people in your security camera feed.
